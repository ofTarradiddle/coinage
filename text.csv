0,"Lycopene has a wide range of biological functions, especially its antioxidant capacity. However, effects of lycopene on muscle fatigue resistant and muscle fiber type conversion are unknown. In this study, we found that lycopene significantly prolonged the swimming time to exhaustion in mice. We also showed that lycopene increased the proportion of slow-twitch muscle fiber by promoting muscle fiber type conversion from fast-twitch to slow-twitch in mice and in C2C12 myotubes. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling was activated by lycopene. AMPK upstream and downstream regulators including nuclear respiratory factor 1, calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β, sirtuin 1 and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ coactivator-1ɑ were also increased by lycopene. AMPK inhibitor compound C markedly attenuated the lycopene-induced skeletal muscle fiber type conversion in C2C12 myotubes. Taken together, we provided the first evidence that lycopene increases the proportion of slow-twitch muscle fiber through AMPK signaling pathway to improve fatigue resistant of skeletal muscle."
0,"Increasing studies report that many natural products can participate in formation of muscle fibers. This study aimed to investigate the effect of lycopene on skeletal muscle-fiber type in vivo and in vitro. C2C12 myoblasts were used in vitro study, and the concentration of lycopene was 10 µM. In vivo, 8-week-old male C57/BL6 mice were used and divided into four groups (n=8): (1) ND: normal-fat diet; (2) ND+Lyc: normal-fat diet mixed with 0.33% w/w lycopene; (3) HFD: high-fat diet; and (4) HFD+Lyc: high-fat diet mixed with 0.33% w/w lycopene. The mice tissue samples were collected after 8 weeks feeding. We found that lycopene supplementation enhanced the protein expression of slow-twitch fiber, succinate dehydrogenase, and malic dehydrogenase enzyme activities, whereas lycopene reduced the protein expression of fast-twitch fibers, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase enzyme activities. Moreover, lycopene can promote skeletal muscle triglyceride deposition, enhanced the mRNA expression of genes related to lipid synthesis, reduced the mRNA expression of genes related to lipolysis. And high-fat diet-induced dyslipidemia and oxidative stress were attenuated after lycopene supplementation. Additionally, lycopene supplementation reduced the glycolytic reserve but enhanced mitochondrial ATP production in C2C12 cells. These results demonstrated that lycopene affects the activities of metabolic enzymes in muscle fibers, promotes the expression of slow-twitch fibers, and enhanced mitochondrial respiratory capacity. We speculated that lycopene affects the muscle-fiber type through aerobic oxidation, suggesting that lycopene exerts potential beneficial effects on skeletal muscle metabolism."
0,"Acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury of skeletal muscle, an important mortality and morbidity cause, is associated with oxidative stress.

1,"Thirty-two Wistar-albino rats were randomly allocated to control, lycopene, I/R and I/R+lycopene groups. In lycopene and I/R+lycopene groups, the rats received 10 mg/kg/day lycopene orally for 15 days before the experiment. Dissection around abdominal aorta at the infrarenal level was performed in all rats under general anesthesia. The aorta was clamped at the infrarenal level in the I/R and I/R+lycopene groups for two hours. Then, reperfusion was allowed for two hours in these groups. Samples were obtained from the hind limb muscles of rats after sacrifice for biochemical and histopathological analyses."
2,Serum and tissue malondialdehyde and ischemia-modified albumin levels were significantly lower in the I/R+lycopene group compared to I/R group (p<0.001). Serum glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels were significantly lower in the I/R group compared to those in control and I/R+lycopene groups (p<0.05). Tissue GSH-Px levels were significantly lower in the I/R group compared to the Lycopene group (p=0.003). Serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were significantly lower in the I/R group compared to three groups (p<0.001). Tissue SOD levels were significantly lower in the I/R group compared to those in control and Lycopene groups (p=0.005). Histopathological assessments revealed that inflammatory changes following I/R injury were significantly reduced in the I/R+lycopene group.
3,The findings obtained in this study show lycopene's cytoprotective activity against I/R injury in rat skeletal muscle model.
0,"Lycopene rich food and dark chocolate are among the best-documented products with a broad health benefit. This study explored the systemic effect of lycopene and dark chocolate (DC) on gut microbiota, blood, liver metabolism, skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation and skin. 30 volunteers were recruited for this trial, 15 women and 15 men with a mean age of 55 ± 5.7 years and with moderate obesity, 30 < BMI < 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. They were randomized and divided into five equal interventional groups: three received different formulations of lycopene, one of them with a 7 mg daily dose and two with 30 mg; another group was given 10 g of DC with 7 mg lycopene embedded into its matrix, and the last group received 10 g DC. The trial was double-blinded for the three lycopene groups and separately for the 2 DC groups; the trial lasted for 1 month. By the end of the trial there were dose-dependent changes in the gut microbiota profile in all three lycopene groups with an increase of relative abundance of, e.g., <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>. This was also accompanied by dose-dependent changes in the blood, liver metabolism, skeletal muscle and skin parameters. Consumption of DC resulted in increased relative abundance of, e.g., <i>Lactobacillus</i> and a reduction of corneocyte exfoliation. This is the first study which reports the prebiotic potential of lycopene and DC."
0,"This study investigated the impact of supplementing normal and high-fat diets with graded levels of lycopene on the growth performance, cholesterol level of the muscle, and antioxidant markers in Japanese quail. A total of 192, 14 day-old unsexed Japanese quail were part of a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement consisting of a control group; birds that were fed a normal fat diet (NFD), another control group; birds that were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with four levels of lycopene for NFD and HFD (0, 100, 200 and 300mg lycopene/kg diet). Lycopene level of 300mg/kg gave the greatest body weight, body weight gain, and relative growth rate when added to the NFD, but this level showed non-significant improvement in growth performance when supplemented to an HFD. Superoxide dismutase in the muscle and liver was noted to be high in NFD+ 300mgL, HFD+ 200mgL, and HFD+ 300mgL groups, while malondialdehyde level in the muscle and liver and cholesterol level in the muscle was found to be low in the same groups. Lycopene slightly improved growth performance, but significantly improved the antioxidant status and lowered cholesterol concentration in the muscle. A diet supplemented with 300 mg lycopene/kg could be recommended for Japanese quail."
0,"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of lycopene addition for curing turkey meat on the profile of fatty acids, total cholesterol, vitamin content, and the TBARS of the final products. The analyzed material comprised 64 breast muscles, of which 16 (RBM) were immediately transported to a laboratory. Another 16 (UBM) were heat treated in a convection steam oven, and 32 muscles were cured for 3 days in two types of curing mixture: without (CBM) and with (CBM+Lyc) tomato peel extract standardized for 5% lycopene content. After completed curing, samples were steamed and grilled under the same conditions as raw samples. Statistical analysis demonstrated the highest (P≤0.01) mean content of vitamin A (0.07 μg/g) in chilled muscles. The content of vitamin E was lower (P≤0.01) in UBM samples than in CBM+Lyc and RBM. The TBARS value was the lowest (P≤0.01) in RBM muscles (0.35 mg MDA/kg of meat). Although there were no differences between products, but lower TBARS were found in CBM+Lyc samples. The content of cholesterol was higher (P≤0.01) in CBM+Lyc products than in the RBM and UBM. RBM samples contained (P≤0.01) the lowest amount of saturated, monounsaturated, and hypercholesterolemic fatty acids, and the highest of unsaturated, polyunsaturated, and hypocholesterolemic fatty acids. CBM+Lyc samples contained (P≤0.01) less hypercholesterolemic and more hypocholesterolemic fatty acids than CBM group. Higher (P≤0.01) unsaturated/saturated and hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic fatty acid ratios were also found in CBM+Lyc products. The study demonstrated that the used processing technology caused reduction (P≤0.01) of n-3 and n-6 PUFA content. Findings suggest that the addition of lycopene in the process of meat curing and heat treatment in meat industry do not change the content of vitamins and cholesterol or alter the TBARS value in turkey meat products. Nevertheless, lycopene can be used to increase the content of essential hypocholesterolemic fatty acids and decrease the content of saturated hypercholesterolemic fatty acids."
0,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary lycopene powder on meat quality and the oxidative stability of lipid and protein of longissimus thoracis (LT) in lamb. A total of 30 male lambs were randomly sampled from three feeding groups (control without lycopene supplement, 200 and 400 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> lycopene powder respectively) after 3 months of feeding. The muscle samples were taken after slaughter and stored at 4 °C for 7 days."
1,"Compared with the control, the results showed that supplementation with lycopene powder gave a higher a<sup>*</sup> value (redness), and increased the levels of vitamin A and vitamin E.

0,"Aroclor 1254 is the commercial mixture of highly toxic environmental pollutant, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Being immensely durable, it is extensively used and widely distributed. Studies show that Aroclor 1254 causes a variety of adverse health effects through free radical generation. The present investigation was designed to check the effect of Aroclor 1254 on the glucose transporter protein, GLUT4, which plays a key role in glucose homeostasis. The protective role of lycopene against the adverse effect of Aroclor 1254 was also tested. Group 1 rats received corn oil as vehicle and served as control. Groups 2, 3, and 4 were administered with Aroclor 1254 [2 mg kg(-1) body weight (b.w.) day(-1)] intraperitoneally for 30 days. Groups 3 and 4 received lycopene (2 and 4 mg kg(-1) b.w. day(-1), respectively) orally in addition to Aroclor 1254. After 30 days, animals were euthanized and the skeletal muscles were dissected to determine the following parameters: GLUT4 messenger RNA (mRNA), GLUT4 protein (both plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions), and (14)C-2-deoxyglucose uptake. Though there was no change in GLUT4 mRNA and fasting plasma glucose levels, Aroclor 1254 significantly decreased the GLUT4 protein level in both the subcellular fractions of the gracilis and triceps muscles. Most important, (14)C-2-deoxyglucose uptake showed a significant decrease in Aroclor 1254 alone treated rats, and Aroclor 1254 plus 4 mg lycopene supplementation treatment maintained the same at par with control. Thus, Aroclor 1254 has adverse effects on GLUT4 translocation and (14)C-2-deoxyglucose uptake, and lycopene administered along with Aroclor 1254 has a protective role over it."
0,"Oxidative stress is considered an important pathogenic process of cardiac hypertrophy. Lycopene is a kind of carotenoid antioxidant that protects the cardiovascular system, so we hypothesized that lycopene might inhibit cardiac hypertrophy by attenuating oxidative stress. Phenylephrine and pressure overload were used to set up the hypertrophic models in vitro and in vivo respectively. Our data revealed that treatment with lycopene can significantly block pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in in vitro and in vivo studies. Further studies demonstrated that lycopene can reverse the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during the process of hypertrophy and can retard the activation of ROS-dependent pro-hypertrophic MAPK and Akt signaling pathways. In addition, protective effects of lycopene on the permeability transition pore opening in neonatal cardiomyocytes were observed. Moreover, we demonstrated that lycopene restored impaired antioxidant response element (ARE) activity and activated ARE-driven expression of antioxidant genes. Consequently, our findings indicated that lycopene inhibited cardiac hypertrophy by suppressing ROS-dependent mechanisms."
0,"This study evaluated the effects of tomato sauce and lycopene on hepatic and cardiac cell biomarkers in rats fed a high-fat diet. Animals were split into five groups: control group, high-fat group (HG), high-fat tomato sauce group, high-fat lycopene 2 mg, and high-fat lycopene 4 mg. Food and water were offered <i>ad libitum</i>, whereas tomato sauce and lycopene (2 and 4 mg/day) were offered daily for 60 days. Body, heart, and liver weights, cardiosomatic and hepatosomatic indices, and serum parameters were also analyzed in rats. The animals' hearts and liver were processed, and cells were examined by flow cytometry. Results showed that the groups receiving tomato sauce and lycopene had lower glycemia. The serum concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hepatic enzymes, and tumor necrosis factor-<i>α</i> did not change upon treatment. Tomato sauce and lycopene supplementation did not increase interleukin-1<i>β</i> in response to a high-fat diet. Cell cycle analysis of cardiac and liver cells showed a lower percentage of cells in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase and an increase in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase in HG. Both lycopene and tomato sauce reversed this effect. Both lycopene and tomato sauce reversed this effect and prevented high-fat diet-stimulated cardiac and liver cell death. Supplementation of tomato sauce and lycopene showed beneficial effects on cardiac and liver cell metabolism; therefore, it is suggested as a nutritional approach for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis."
0,"Identification of a new agent from natural products for the protection of embryonic anomalies is potentially valuable. To investigate the protective effect exerted by lycopene against nicotine-induced malformations, mouse embryos in embryonic day 8.5 with yolk sac placentas were cocultured with 1 mM nicotine and/or lycopene (1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> <i>μ</i>M) for 48 h. The morphological defects and apoptotic cell deaths in the embryo and yolk sac placenta of the nicotine group were significantly increased. Exposure to nicotine resulted in reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and cytoplasmic SOD and cytoplasmic glutathione peroxidase mRNA levels, but increased lipid peroxidation level in embryos. Moreover, treatment with nicotine resulted in aggravated expressions of the mRNA or protein level of antiapoptotic (BCL2-associated X protein, B-cell lymphoma-extralarge, and caspase 3), anti-inflammatory (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and tumor necrosis factor-alpha), and vasculogenic (vascular endothelial growth factor-alpha, insulin-like growth factor-1, alpha smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor-beta 1, and hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha) factors in the embryo and yolk sac placenta. However, all the parameters were significantly improved by treatment with lycopene, as compared to the nicotine group. These findings indicate the potential of lycopene as a protective agent against embryonic anomalies and yolk sac vasculogenic and placenta-forming defects induced by nicotine through modulations of oxidative, apoptotic, vasculogenic, and inflammatory activities."
0,"Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) is located on the Down syndrome critical region (DSCR) locus in human chromosome 21. Oxidative stress and overexpression of RCAN1 are implicated in neuronal impairment in Down's syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Serum level of lycopene, an antioxidant pigment, is low in DS and AD patients, which may be related to neuronal damage. The present study is to investigate whether lycopene inhibits apoptosis by reducing ROS levels, NF-κB activation, expression of the apoptosis regulator Nucling, cell viability, and indices of apoptosis (cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation) in RCAN1-overexpressing neuronal cells."
1,"Cells transfected with either pcDNA or RCAN1 were treated with or without lycopene. Lycopene decreased intracellular and mitochondrial ROS levels, NF-κB activity, and Nucling expression while it reversed decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial respiration, and glycolytic function in RCAN1-overexpressing cells. Lycopene inhibited cell death, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and cytochrome c release in RCAN1-overexpressing cells."
2,"Lycopene inhibits RCAN1-mediated apoptosis by reducing ROS levels and by inhibiting NF-κB activation, Nucling induction, and the increase in apoptotic indices in neuronal cells.

0,"<b></b> This study investigates lycopene's preventive efficacy in skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced lung injury. Thirty-two rats were randomly assigned to control group, lycopene group, I/R group and I/R + lycopene group. In the lycopene and I/R + lycopene groups, the rats initially received 10 mg/kg/day lycopene orally for 15 days. Then, dissection around the abdominal aorta was performed in all rats under general anesthesia. The aorta was clamped at the infrarenal level in the I/R group and I/R + lycopene group for two hours before two hours of reperfusion. The mean serum levels of malondialdehyde (53.0 ± 20.14 nmol/mL) and superoxide dismutase (1.03 ± 0.16 U/mL) were higher and lower in the I/R group than the other three groups, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean serum IMA level of I/R + lycopene group (0.42 ± 0.04 abs/u) was lower than the I/R group (0.47 ± 0.04 abs/u) (p = 0.015). The mean tissue malondialdehyde levels of I/R group (69.10 ± 11.55 nmol/mL) and I/R + lycopene group (68.36 ± 21.17 nmol/mL) were high compared to the control group (49.87 ± 6.52 nmol/mL) and lycopene group (47.82 ± 4.44 nmol/mL) (p = 0.002). The mean tissue glutathione peroxidase (p < 0.001) and superoxide dismutase (p = 0.001) levels of I/R group (121.81 ± 43.59 nmol/mL and 25.17 ± 8.69 U/mL) were low compared to the control group (236.12 ± 18.01 nmol/mL and 46.30 ± 5.17 U/mL), lycopene group (227.52 ± 16.92 nmol/mL and 45.82 ± 4.02 U/mL), and I/R + lycopene group (176.02 ± 24.27 nmol/mL and 35.20 ± 4.85 U/mL). The histopathological analyses of I/R + lycopene group indicated less significant changes than the control group. Tissue damage in the I/R + lycopene group was less prominent than the I/R group. These findings suggest oral lycopene supplementation as a promising prevention against skeletal muscle I/R caused lung injury."
0,"This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary lycopene supplementation on growth performance, antioxidant status, and muscle nuclear transcription factor [Kelch like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)] expressions in broiler chickens exposed to heat stress (HS). A total of 180 one-day-old male broiler chicks (Ross 308) were assigned randomly to one of 2×3 factorially arranged treatments: two housing temperatures (22°C for 24 h/d; thermoneutral, TN or 34°C for 8 h/d HS) and three dietary lycopene levels (0, 200, or 400 mg/kg). Each treatment consisted of three replicates of 10 birds. Birds were reared to 42 d of age. Heat stress caused reductions in feed intake and weight gain by 12.2 and 20.7% and increased feed efficiency by 10.8% (P<0.0001 for all). Increasing dietary lycopene level improved performance in both environments. Birds reared under the HS environment had lower serum and muscle lycopene concentration (0.34 vs. 0.50 μg/mL and 2.80 vs. 2.13 μg/g), activities of superoxide dismutase (151 vs. 126 U/mL and 131 vs. 155 U/mg protein), glutathione peroxidase (184 vs. 154 U/mL and 1.39 vs. 1.74 U/mg protein), and higher malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration (0.53 vs. 0.83 μg/mL and 0.78 vs. 0.45 μg/ mg protein) than birds reared under the TN environment. Changes in levels of lycopene and MDA and activities of enzymes in serum and muscle varied by the environmental temperature as dietary lycopene level increased. Moreover, increasing dietary lycopene level suppressed muscle Keap1 expression and enhanced muscle Nrf2 expression, which had increased by 150% and decreased by 40%, respectively in response to HS. In conclusion, lycopene supplementation alleviates adverse effects of HS on performance through modulating expressions of stress-related nuclear transcription factors."
0,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different levels of lycopene supplementation on the carcass traits, meat quality, concentration of lipid oxidation products and antioxidant potential in the meat and liver of finishing barrows and gilts."
1,"A total of 40 barrows and 40 gilts were allotted in a completely randomized block design, arranged in a 2×5 factorial scheme, consisting of two sexes (barrows and gilts) and five dietary levels of lycopene (0, 12.5, 25.0, 37.5, and 50.0 mg/kg). In addition, four storage times (0, 24, 48, and 72 h), at 4°C, were added to the model to evaluate the longissimus lumborum muscle."
2,"An interaction (p = 0.010) was observed between storage periods and dietary lycopene levels. The unfolding of the interaction (lycopene×period) showed a decreasing concentration of malondialdehyde concentration as the dietary lycopene increased, at all storage periods. No interactions (p>0.050) were observed for the 2,2 diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in the pork. However, the percentage of DPPH radical inhibition reduced (p = 0.001) up to 72 h. Additionally, there was a linear increase (p = 0.001) in the capture of DPPH radicals by antioxidants, as the dietary lycopene increased. No interactions were observed (p>0.05) between the evaluated factors in liver. However, lipid oxidation was reduced by supplementing lycopene in pig diets. The capture of the DPPH radical, resulted increase in the antioxidant power exerted by lycopene in the liver (p = 0.001). The concentrations of the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and DPPH in the liver were affected by sex (p = 0.001)."
3,"Dietary supplementation of lycopene reduced the water loss during thawing and was effective in protecting against oxidation of the longissimus lumborum muscle and liver until 72 hours of storage, and the best results were obtained by supplementing with 50.0 mg of lycopene/kg of diet."
0,"Recent experiments showed a potential cardiotoxic effect of the macrolide antibiotic (tulathromycin). This study was performed to investigate whether diclofenac sodium (DFS) potentiates the cardiotoxicity of tulathromycin and increases the cardioprotective effects of lycopene against DFS and tulathromycin. Seven groups (eight per group) of adult Swiss albino mice received saline (control), tulathromycin (a single subcutaneous dose of 28 mg/kg/bw on day 14), DFS (a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg/bw on day 14), tulathromycin plus DFS, or lycopene (oral, 10 mg/kg/bw daily for 15 d) combined with tulathromycin, DFS, or both. Compared to the control group, the administration of tulathromycin or DFS (individually or in combination) caused significantly elevated (<i>p</i> < 0.05) serum levels of Creatine kinase-myocardial B fraction (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase, and cardiac-specific troponin-T and tissue levels of nitric oxide and malondialdehyde that were accompanied by significantly decreased tissue reduced glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase antioxidant enzyme activity. Upon histopathological and immunohistochemical examination, the mean pathology scores and the percentages of caspase-3-, Bax-, and CK-positive regions were significantly higher in the tulathromycin- and/or DFS-treated groups than in control mice. For all these parameters, the pathological changes were more significant in the tulathromycin-DFS combination group than in mice treated with either drug individually. Interestingly, co-administration of lycopene with tulathromycin and/or DFS significantly ameliorated the changes described above. In conclusion, DFS could potentiate the cardiotoxic effects of tulathromycin, whereas lycopene can serve as a cardioprotective agent against DFS and tulathromycin."
0,"<i>Objective.</i> Transplant arteriosclerosis is considered one of the major factors affecting the survival time of grafts after organ transplantation. In this study, we proposed a hypothesis of whether lycopene can protect grafted vessels through regulating key proteins expression involved in arteriosclerosis. <i>Methods.</i> Allogeneic aortic transplantation was performed using Brow-Norway rats as donors and Lewis rats as recipients. After transplantation, the recipients were divided into two groups: the allograft group and the lycopene group. Negative control rats (isograft group) were also established. Histopathological staining was performed to observe the pathological changes, and the expression levels of Ki-67, caspase-3, Rho-associated kinases, intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1), and eNOS were assessed. Western blotting analysis and real-time PCR were also performed for quantitative analysis. <i>Results.</i> The histopathological staining showed that vascular stenosis and intimal thickening were not evident after lycopene treatment. The Ki-67, ROCK1, ROCK2, and ICAM-1 expression levels were significantly decreased. However, eNOS expression in grafted arteries and plasma cGMP concentration were increased after lycopene treatment. <i>Conclusions.</i> Lycopene could alleviate vascular arteriosclerosis in allograft transplantation via downregulating Rho-associated kinases and regulating key factor expression through the NO/cGMP pathways, which may provide a potentially effective method for transplant arteriosclerosis in clinical organ transplantation."
0,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent stimulator of growth and motility of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and fibroblasts. Abnormalities of PDGF/PDGF receptor (PDGFR) are thought to contribute to vascular diseases and malignancy. We previously showed that natural carotenoid lycopene can directly bind to PDGF-BB and affect its related functions in vascular SMCs. In this study we examined lycopene effect on PDGF-AA/-AB-induced signaling and migration in SMCs and fibroblasts. We found that lycopene inhibited PDGF-AA-induced SMC and fibroblast migration in a concentration-dependent manner. Lycopene reduced PDGF-AA signaling, including phosphorylation in PDGFR-alpha and its downstream protein kinases/enzymes. It also inhibited PDGF-AB-induced signaling and cell migration. However, lycopene did not affect PDGF-induced reactive oxygen species production and H2O2-induced PDGFR phosphorylation. The binding analysis revealed that lycopene but not beta-carotene could directly bind to PDGF-AA in vitro and in plasma and this binding competitively inhibited lycopene interaction with PDGF-BB, suggesting that lycopene bound to PDGF-AA/-BB at a homologous/similar region within PDGF. Moreover, the docking and binding analyses predicted that the lycopene-binding region within PDGF was located at loop 2 region. Taken together, we provide here evidence that lycopene interacts with PDGF-AA/-AB and compromises their intracellular signaling, leading to a marked inhibition on PDGF-AA/-AB-induced migration in both SMCs and fibroblasts. We also predicted its binding region within PDGF and proved its anti-vascular injury effect in vivo. The results, together with our previous findings, suggest lycopene special affinity/effect for PDGF family and its possible application in prevention in vascular diseases and malignancy."
0,"Oral uptake of lycopene has been shown to be beneficial for preventing myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the strong first-pass metabolism of lycopene influences its bioavailability and impedes its clinic application. In this study, we determined an intravenous (IV) administration dose of lycopene protects against myocardial infarction (MI) in a mouse model, and investigated the effects of acute lycopene administration on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and related signaling pathways during myocardial I/R."
1,"In this study, we established both in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cell model and in vivo regional myocardial I/R mouse model by ligating left anterior artery descending. TTC dual staining was used to assess I/R induced MI in the absence and presence of acute lycopene administration via tail vein injection."
2,"Lycopene treatment (1 μM) before reoxygenation significantly reduced cardiomyocyte death induced by H/R. Intravenous administration of lycopene to achieve 1 μM concentration in circulating blood significantly suppressed MI, ROS production, and JNK phosphorylation in the cardiac tissue of mice during in vivo regional I/R."
3,Elevating circulating lycopene to 1 μM via IV injection protects against myocardial I/R injury through inhibition of ROS accumulation and consequent inflammation in mice.
0,"Nowadays, drugs protecting ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) myocardium become more suitable for clinic. It has been confirmed lycopene has various protections, but lacking the observation of its effect on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-mediated apoptosis caused by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). This study aims to clarify the protective effect of lycopene on ERS induced by H/R in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Detect the survival rate, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, apoptosis ratio, glucose-regulated proteins 78 (GRP78), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), c-Jun-N-terminal protein Kinase (JNK) and Caspase-12 mRNA and protein expression and phosphorylation of JNK (p-JNK) protein expression. LDH activity, apoptosis ratio and GRP78 protein expression increase in the H/R group, reduced by lycopene. The survival rate reduces in the H/R and thapsigargin (TG) groups; lycopene and 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA) can improve it caused by H/R, lycopene also can improve it caused by TG. The apoptosis ratio, the expression of GRP78, CHOP and Caspase-12 mRNA and protein and p-JNK protein increase in the H/R and TG groups, weaken in the lycopene+H/R, 4-PBA+H/R and lycopene+TG groups. There is no obvious change in the expression of JNK mRNA or protein. Hence, our results provide the evidence that 10 μM lycopene plays an obviously protective effect on H/R H9C2 cardiomyocytes, realized through reducing ERS and apoptosis. The possible mechanism may be related to CHOP, p-JNK and Caspase-12 pathways."

1,"Primary cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were randomly divided to control group (control); lycopene group (5 μmol/L, lyc); H/R group (4 hours hypoxia followed by 6 hours reoxgenation); lycopene+ H/R group (lyc+ H/R, the cardiomyocytes were incubated with 5 μmol/L lycopene for 4 hours before H/R treatment). The cell viability of cardiomyocytes was assessed by CCK-8 assay. The apoptotic rate of cardiomyocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry using AnnexinV-PI double staining. Western blot was used to determine the GRP78, CHOP, Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression in cardiomyocytes. The mRNA expressions of ATF6、eIF2α and sXbp-1 were detected by real-time PCR. The fluorescence intensity for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiomyocytes was measured with Olympus fluorescence microscope."
2,"Compared to control group, the cell viability of cardiomyocytes was significantly reduced ((64.28±6.12)% vs. (100.00±4.98)%, P<0.01), the apoptotic rate ((24.42±1.76)% vs. (5.16±1.31)%, P<0.01) and ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 (2.33±0.20 vs. 1.00±0.09, P<0.01) significantly increased, the ATF6, eIF2α and sXbp-1 mRNA expression, the CHOP and GRP78 protein expression (1.98±0.15 vs. 1.00±0.12, 2.09±0.11 vs. 1.00±0.09) as well as fluorescence intensity for ROS ((262.13±22.03)% vs. (100.00±12.35)%) were markedly increased in H/R group (all P<0.01). Compared to the H/R group, pretreatment with lycopene markedly improved the cell viability of cardiomyocytes ((81.75±6.85)%, P<0.01), significantly decreased the apoptotic rate ((17.24±2.02)%, P<0.01) and ratio of Bax/Bcl-2(1.64±0.13, P<0.01), significantly down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of ATF6, eIF2α and sXbp-1, and the protein expression levels of CHOP (1.54±0.12) and GRP78 (1.53±0.12), significantly reduced the fluorescence intensity for ROS ((171.18±19.09)%, all P<0.01)."

0,"Tardive Dyskinesia is a severe side effect of chronic neuroleptic treatment consisting of abnormal involuntary movements, characterized by orofacial dyskinesia. The study was designed to investigate the protective effect of lycopene against haloperidol induced orofacial dyskinesia possibly by neurochemical and neuroinflammatory modulation in rats. Rats were administered with haloperidol (1mg/kg, i.p for 21 days) to induce orofacial dyskinesia. Lycopene (5 and 10mg/kg, p.o) was given daily 1hour before haloperidol treatment for 21 days. Behavioral observations (vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions, facial jerking, rotarod activity, grip strength, narrow beam walking) were assessed on 0th, 7th(,) 14th(,) 21st day after haloperidol treatment. On 22nd day, animals were killed and striatum was excised for estimation of biochemical parameters (malondialdehyde, nitrite and endogenous enzyme (GSH), pro-inflammatory cytokines [Tumor necrosis factor, Interleukin 1β, Interleukin 6] and neurotransmitters level (dopamine, serotonin, nor epinephrine, 5-Hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), Homovanillic acid, 3,4- dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. Haloperidol treatment for 21 days impaired muscle co-ordination, motor activity and grip strength with an increased in orofacial dyskinetic movements. Further free radical generation increases MDA and nitrite levels, decreasing GSH levels in striatum. Neuroinflammatory markers were significantly increased with decrease in neurotransmitters levels. Lycopene (5 and 10mg/kg, p.o) treatment along with haloperidol significantly attenuated impairment in behavioral, biochemical, neurochemical and neuroinflammatory markers. Results of the present study attributed the therapeutic potential of lycopene in the treatment (prevented or delayed) of typical antipsychotic induced orofacial dyskinesia. "
0,"Ischemic postconditioning (IPoC) has been demonstrated to prevent myocardial ischemia‑reperfusion injury (MIRI), but its cardioprotective effect is abrogated by hypercholesterolemia. The aim of the present study was to determine whether lycopene (LP), a type of carotenoid, can restore the cardioprotective effect of IPoC in hypercholesterolemic rats. Male Wistar rats were fed a cholesterol‑enriched diet for 12 weeks to establish a hypercholesterolemic model. The rat hearts were isolated and subjected to 30 min ischemia and 60 min reperfusion using a Langendorff apparatus. LP was administered to the rats intraperitoneally for 5 consecutive days prior to ischemia and reperfusion. Myocardial pathological changes, infarct size and cell apoptosis were measured by hematoxylin and eosin, triphenyltetrazolium chloride and TUNEL staining, respectively. The changes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway and mitochondrial apoptosis‑related proteins were detected by western blotting. Overall, the results demonstrated that low‑dose LP in combination with IPoC ameliorated myocardial histopathological changes, reduced the infarct size and release of cardiac enzymes, and decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in hypercholesterolemic rats, but no beneficial effects were achieved by the same dose of LP or IPoC treatment were used alone. Furthermore, the combination of LP and IPoC inhibited the expression of glucose‑regulated protein 78 and C/EBP homologous protein, increased the phosphorylation levels of AKT, ERK1/2 and glycogen synthase kinase‑3β, repressed mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, and reduced the expression of cytochrome c, cleaved caspase‑9 and cleaved caspase‑3. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that LP can restore the cardioprotective effects of IPoC on MIRI in hypercholesterolemic rats, and this restoration by LP was mediated by inhibition of ER stress and reactivation of the RISK pathway in hypercholesterolemic rat myocardium."
0,"Mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction and oxidative stress are involved in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-injury. Lycopene, a lipophilic antioxidant found mainly in tomatoes and in other vegetables and fruits, can protect mtDNA against oxidative damage. However, the role of mtDNA in myocardial I/R-injury is unclear. In the present study, we aimed to determine if and how lycopene protects cardiomyocytes from I/R-injury. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, I/R-injury increased mt 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OHdG) content, decreased mtDNA content and mtDNA transcription levels, and caused mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes. These effects of I/R injury on cardiomycoytes were blocked by pre-treatment with lycopene. MtDNA depletion alone was sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte death. I/R-injury decreased the protein level of a key activator of mt transcription, mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), which was blocked by lycopene. The protective effect of lycopene on mtDNA was associated with a reduction in mitochondrial ROS production and stabilization of Tfam. In conclusion, lycopene protects cardiomyocytes from the oxidative damage of mtDNA induced by I/R-injury."
0,"Inflammatory response and cardiomyocyte apoptosis are important processes in ventricular remodeling post-myocardial infarction (MI) and may form the basic mechanisms in the development of chronic heart failure. The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway could promote inflammation and apoptosis and it has been demonstrated that lycopene inhibits cigarette smoke extract-mediated NF-κB activation. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the NF-κB signaling pathway may be a key target of lycopene in the reversal of ventricular remodeling post MI. An MI model was established by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation in mice. Following ligation, the mice were administered with lycopene (10 mg/kg/day) or saline. The mice underwent echocardiography and were sacrificed after 4 weeks. The mRNA expression of fibrosis markers transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), collagen I and III and inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The protein expression of apoptotic markers, including caspase-3, -8, -9 and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway were analyzed by western blotting. Lycopene reduced the expression of TGF-β1, collagen I, collagen III, TNF-α, IL-1β, caspase-3, -8 and -9 and inhibited the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. The level of ventricular remodeling post-MI was also attenuated following treatment with lycopene. Lycopene may inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway thereby reducing the inflammatory response and cardiomyocyte apoptosis post-MI, which could be a key mechanism of lycopene in attenuating ventricular remodeling."
0,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced apoptosis plays a pivotal role in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-injury. Inhibiting ER stress is a major therapeutic target/strategy in treating cardiovascular diseases. Our previous studies revealed that lycopene exhibits great pharmacological potential in protecting against the I/R-injury in vitro and vivo, but whether attenuation of ER stress (and) or ER stress-induced apoptosis contributes to the effects remains unclear. In the present study, using neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes to establish an in vitro model of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) to mimic myocardium I/R in vivo, we aimed to explore the hypothesis that lycopene could alleviate the ER stress and ER stress-induced apoptosis in H/R-injury. We observed that lycopene alleviated the H/R injury as revealed by improving cell viability and reducing apoptosis, suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and improved the phosphorylated AMPK expression, attenuated ER stress as evidenced by decreasing the expression of GRP78, ATF6 mRNA, sXbp-1 mRNA, eIF2α mRNA and eIF2α phosphorylation, alleviated ER stress-induced apoptosis as manifested by reducing CHOP/GADD153 expression, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-12 and caspase-3 activity in H/R-treated cardiomyocytes. Thapsigargin (TG) is a potent ER stress inducer and used to elicit ER stress of cardiomyocytes. Our results showed that lycopene was able to prevent TG-induced ER stress as reflected by attenuating the protein expression of GRP78 and CHOP/GADD153 compared to TG group, significantly improve TG-caused a loss of cell viability and decrease apoptosis in TG-treated cardiomyocytes. These results suggest that the protective effects of lycopene on H/R-injury are, at least in part, through alleviating ER stress and ER stress-induced apoptosis in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. "
0,To investigate the possible mechanism of lycopene on protecting against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-injury.
1,"Primary cultured cardiomyocytes, isolated from neonatal mouse, were divided into three groups randomly: control group (C) ; H/R group(4 h H followed by 8 h R); lycopene+H/R group(L+H/R), in which the cardiomyocytes were pretreated with lycopene for 4 h before H/R. The survival of cardiomyocytes was counted. Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL assays. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondrial matrix into the cytosol, the activity of caspase-3, intracellular ROS levels and the activity of calpain were also determined in these groups respectively at the same time."
2,"The pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with lycopene significantly improved the survival of cardiomyocytes [C: (89.84 ± 5.15)%, H/R: (63.59 ± 5.11)%, L+H/R: (79.25 ± 1.48)%, P < 0.05] and reduced the extent of apoptosis [C: ( 10.37 ± 1.25)%, H/R: (32.03 ± 4.79)%, L+H/R: (22.57 ± 3.22)%, P < 0.05], significantly reduced caspase-3 activation [C: (2.61 ± 0.19), H/R: (5.82 ± 0.92), L+H/R: (3.74 ± 0.64) pNA pmol/µg protein, P < 0.05]. To further study the mechanism underlying the benefits of lycopene, interactions between lycopene and calpain activation were examined. Lycopene pretreatment of cardiomyocytes suppressed the activation of calpain(C:272.33 ± 300.46, H/R: 1156.00 ± 212.02, L+H/R: 607.33 ± 166.23, P < 0.05) by reducing the H/R induced increased intracellular ROS levels [C: 100%, H/R: (239.79 ± 27.27)%, L+H/R: (188.19 ± 17.63)%, P < 0.05]."
3,Lycopene may protect against hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced injury by preventing calpain activation.
0,"This study was designed to investigate the impact of dietary lycopene (antioxidant extracted from tomato) supplementation on postmortem antioxidant capacity, drip loss and protein expression profiles of lamb meat during storage. Thirty male Hu lambs were randomly divided into three treatment groups and housed in individual pens and received 0, 200 or 400 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> lycopene in their diet, respectively. All lambs were slaughtered after 3 months of fattening, and the longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle was collected for analyses. The results indicated that drip loss of LT muscle increased with storage days (<i>P</i> < 0.05). After storage for 7 days, significantly lower drip loss of meat was found in fed the lycopene-supplemented diet (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Dietary lycopene supplementation increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes (total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT)) (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and decreased the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and carbonyl contents (<i>P</i> < 0.05). During the storage period (days 0, 5 and 7), a number of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs), including oxidases, metabolic enzymes, calcium channels and structural proteins, were identified based on iTRAQ data, with roles predominantly in carbon metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, cardiac muscle contraction and proteasome pathways, and which contribute to decreased drip loss of lamb meat during storage. It can be concluded that dietary lycopene supplementation increased antioxidant capacity after slaughter, and the decreased drip loss during postmortem storage might occur by changing the expression of proteins related to enzyme activity and cellular structure in lamb muscle."
0,"Lycopene (Ly) is a kind of hydrocarbon, which belongs to the family of tetraterpene carotene and exists in red fruits and vegetables. The decrease of capillary density and blood flow with age is a significant reason for the increase of mortality and morbidity. Herein, our study aims to explore the effects of Ly (a bioactive food compound) on vascular aging in vitro and in vivo and its potential mechanisms. The cytological results showed that Ly could promote the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) and enhance the ability of HUVECs to form capillary-like structures. Furthermore, the expression of SIRT1 in aged HUVECs was up-regulated. In vivo, aging rats showed signs of insulin resistance and blood vessel damage. Additionally, the capillary density and blood flow were reduced during the vascular aging process in both D-gal-induced and naturally aging muscle. However, when Ly was given, these conditions could be reversed. Simultaneously, the contents of ATP, lactic acid and pyruvic acid were determined, and it was found that Ly could promote angiogenesis by increasing the utilization rate of glucose and promoting energy metabolism. Finally, in the insulin resistance cell model, we knocked down the SIRT1 and administrated with Ly, and found that it couldn't restore insulin transdution. In conclusion, all the data in this study demonstrate that Ly could reactivate SIRT1 and improve insulin resistance, which was a reversible cause of vascular aging."
0,"Peripheral nerves are commonly damaged. Although the nerve autograft still subsists the gold standard in surgery of nerve injury gaps, it has severe detriment. The egg shell membrane (ESM) is a natural material, which has a great potential in practice. The aim of this survey was to appraise the effect of lycopene and the ESM nerve guidance channel on sciatic nerve regeneration."
1,"In this study, 32 male rats were randomized into four groups: sham surgery, autograft, ESM+ dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and ESM+lycopene. One centimeter of sciatic nerve was removed, and the gap was grafted by ESM channel or autograft. The sciatic function index (SFI) was evaluated at days 7, 21, 30, 49, 60 and 90 after surgery. Nerve regeneration and gastroknemius muscle fibers were evaluated at days 30 and 90 after surgery by withdrawal reflex latency (WRL), histology and immunohistology assessments."
2,"At 49, 60 and 90 days after surgery, the mean SFI in ESM+lycopene group was significantly greater than ESM+DMSO group (<i>P<</i>0.05). On day 90, the mean muscle fiber diameters and the mean number of myelinated axons in ESM+lycopene and autograft groups were significantly greater than ESM+DMSO group (<i>P<</i>0.05). In addition, the mean WRL was significantly lower in ESM+lycopene group than in the ESM+DMSO group 90 days after surgery (<i>P<</i>0.05)."
3,The results of this study show that the affirmative effects of ESM+lycopene may be beneficial for treating peripheral nerve damages.
0,Oxidative damage to cellular components such as lipids and cell membranes by free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) is thought to be associated with the development of degenerative diseases. Fluoride intoxication is associated with oxidative stress and altered anti-oxidant defense mechanism. Lycopene is a lipid-soluble powerful anti-oxidant that scavenges free radicals and ROS.
1,This study was extended to investigate lycopene anti-oxidant efficacy in different organs of fluoride-intoxicated rats.
2,"Twenty-four adult rats were randomly divided into four groups of six animals each. Rats in group I received daily doses of vehicle. Group II rats were given lycopene (10 mg/kg body weight/day), by tubes, dissolved in 0.5 ml of corn oil for 5 weeks. Group III rats were given sodium fluoride (NaF) (10.3 mg/kg body weight/day), by tubes, for 5 weeks. In group IV rats, lycopene was administered 1 h later and NaF was administered for 5 weeks."
3,"NaF administration induced oxidative stress as evidenced by elevated levels of lipid peroxidation (51.3, 65.9 and 67.6%) measured as malondialdehyde and total nitrate/nitrite (61.0, 59.7 and 68.9%) in red blood cells, heart and brain tissues. Moreover, significantly decreased reduced glutathione level, total anti-oxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase activity were observed in the examined tissues. The induced oxidative stress and the alterations in anti-oxidant system were normalized by the oral administration of lycopene treatment."
4,Lycopene administration could minimize the toxic effects of fluoride indicating its free-radical scavenging and powerful anti-oxidant activities.
0,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) result from the sub-endothelial accumulation of inflammatory cells and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Lycopene, a natural compound from tomato, has been suggested to play a role in CVD prevention. However, its action mechanism is still largely unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of lycopene on SMCs. We found that preincubation of PDGF-BB with lycopene resulted in a marked inhibition on PDGF-BB-induced PDGF receptor-beta (PDGFR-beta), PLCgamma, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in rat A10 SMCs and primary cultured aortic SMCs. In striking contrast, lycopene did not influence EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, further analysis indicates that lycopene could directly bind PDGF-BB and inhibit PDGF-BB-SMC interaction, as determined by dot binding assay and Western blotting. In functional studies, lycopene inhibited PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation and migration toward gelatin and collagen at concentrations ranging from 2 to 10 microM. On the contrary, lycopene did not inhibit bFGF- and VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration. Gelatin zymography demonstrated that lycopene's effect on SMC migration was not due to the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Taken together, our results provide the first evidence showing that lycopene inhibits PDGF-BB-induced signaling, proliferation and migration in rat A10 and aortic SMCs. One of the action mechanisms is that lycopene is capable of binding PDGF-BB and inhibiting its interaction with SMC, which is quite different from those previously developed PDGFR-beta antagonists. The results presented here may help us to better understand the beneficial effects of lycopene in CVD prevention."
0,"Hypoxia/reoxygenation(H/R)-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes plays an important role in myocardial injury. Lycopene is a potent antioxidant carotenoid that has been shown to have protective properties on cardiovascular system. The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential for lycopene to protect the cardiomyocytes exposed to H/R. Moreover, the effect on mitochondrial function upon lycopene exposure was assessed."
1,"Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal mouse and established an in vitro model of H/R which resembles ischemia/reperfusion in vivo. The pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with 5 µM lycopene significantly reduced the extent of apoptosis detected by TUNEL assays. To further study the mechanism underlying the benefits of lycopene, interactions between lycopene and the process of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis were examined. Lycopene pretreatment of cardiomyocytes suppressed the activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) by reducing the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and inhibiting the increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels caused by H/R. Moreover, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, a decline in cellular ATP levels, a reduction in the amount of cytochrome c translocated to the cytoplasm and caspase-3 activation were observed in lycopene-treated cultures."
2,"The present results suggested that lycopene possesses great pharmacological potential in protecting against H/R-induced apoptosis. Importantly, the protective effects of lycopene may be attributed to its roles in improving mitochondrial function in H/R-treated cardiomyocytes."
0,"Strenuous exercise is known to induce oxidative stress leading to the generation of free radicals. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of lycopene, an antioxidant nutrient, at a relatively low dose (2.6 mg/kg per d) and a relatively high dose (7.8 mg/kg per d) on the antioxidant status of blood and skeletal muscle tissues in rats after exhaustive exercise. Rats were divided into six groups: sedentary control (C); sedentary control with low-dose lycopene (CLL); sedentary control with high-dose lycopene (CHL); exhaustive exercise (E); exhaustive exercise with low-dose lycopene (ELL); exhaustive exercise with high-dose lycopene (EHL). After 30 d, the rats in the three C groups were killed without exercise, but the rats in the three E groups were killed immediately after an exhaustive running test on a motorised treadmill. The results showed that xanthine oxidase (XO) activities of plasma and muscle, and muscular myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in group E were significantly increased compared with group C. Compared with group E, the elevations of XO and MPO activities of muscle were significantly decreased in group EHL. The malondialdehyde concentrations of plasma and tissues in group E were significantly increased by 72 and 114 %, respectively, compared with those in group C. However, this phenomenon was prevented in rats of the ELL and EHL groups. There was no significant difference in the GSH concentrations of erythrocytes in each group; however, exhaustive exercise resulted in a significant decrease in the GSH content of muscle. In conclusion, these results suggested that lycopene protected muscle tissue from oxidative stress after exhaustive exercise."
0,"This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial determined if ingestion of a supplement containing a tomato complex with lycopene, phytoene, and phytofluene (T-LPP) and other compounds for 4 weeks would attenuate inflammation, muscle damage, and oxidative stress postexercise and during recovery from a 2-hr running bout that included 30 min of -10% downhill running. Study participants ingested the T-LPP supplement or placebo with the evening meal for 4 weeks prior to running 2 hr at high intensity. Blood samples and delayed onset muscle soreness ratings were taken pre- and post-4-week supplementation, and immediately following the 2-hr run, and then 1-hr, 24-hr, and 48-hr postrun. After a 2-week washout period, participants crossed over to the opposite treatment and repeated all procedures. Plasma lycopene, phytoene, and phytofluene increased significantly in T-LPP compared with placebo (p < .001 for each). Significant time effects were shown for serum creatine kinase, delayed onset muscle soreness, C-reactive protein, myoglobin, 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids, ferric reducing ability of plasma, and six plasma cytokines (p < .001 for each). The pattern of increase for serum myoglobin differed between T-LPP and placebo (interaction effect, p = .016, with lower levels in T-LPP), but not for creatine kinase, delayed onset muscle soreness, C-reactive protein, the six cytokines, 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids, and ferric reducing ability of plasma. No significant time or interaction effects were measured for plasma-oxidized low-density lipoprotein or serum 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. In summary, supplementation with T-LPP over a 4-week period increased plasma carotenoid levels 73% and attenuated postexercise increases in the muscle damage biomarker myoglobin, but not inflammation and oxidative stress."
0,"The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of lycopene (LCP) against isoproterenol (ISP)-induced myocardial infarction (MI), by assessing hemodynamic, biochemical and histopathological parameters. Wistar male albino rats were orally administered with LCP (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg) or with vehicle for 30 days, with concurrent subcutaneous injections of ISP (85 mg/kg) on days 28 and 29. ISP significantly (p < 0.05) decreased systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure (SAP, DAP and MAP, respectively) and heart rate (HR). ISP also decreased contractility (+LVdP/dt), relaxation (-LVdP/dt) and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). In addition to functional impairment, ISP also caused a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in antioxidants, namely, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), glutathione (GSH), cardiac injury marker enzymes, creatine phosphokinase-MB (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as induced lipid peroxidation, malonaldialdehyde (MDA) and histopathological alterations in heart. However, pretreatment with LCP significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated ISP-induced cardiac dysfunction as evidenced by improved SAP, DAP, MAP, HR, (±)LVdP/dt and reduced LVEDP. Pretreatment with LCP also significantly (p < 0.05) prevented the depletion of antioxidants (SOD, CAT, GSHPx and GSH), myocyte injury marker enzymes (CK-MB and LDH) and inhibited lipid peroxidation and MDA formation in the heart. Furthermore, reduced necrosis, edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells on histopathological examination also depicted the protective effect of LCP against the deleterious effect of ISP. Based on the results, it is suggested that LCP possesses significant cardioprotective potential and may serve as an adjunct in treatment and prophylaxis of MI."
0,"Natural compounds are known to modify NO content in tissues; however, the biological activity of polyphenol-rich food often does not correspond to the effects of individual polyphenols on NO synthase activity. The aim of this study was to see how natural compounds luteolin, indole-3-carbinol, and lycopene modify NO production in rat tissues and change the expression of the iNOS gene and protein. Indole-3-carbinol produced multiple effects on the NO level; it significantly decreased NO concentration in blood, lungs, and skeletal muscles and increased it in the liver. Indole-3-carbinol enhanced lipopolyssaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production in all rat organs. It decreased iNOS gene expression in the brain cortex of animals that did not receive LPS and up-regulated it in the LPS-treated animals. Lycopene increased the iNOS gene transcription rate in the brain cortex of LPS-treated animals. Luteolin did not modify NO production in any organ of LPS-untreated rats, nor did it affect gene expression in the liver. In the brain it slightly decreased iNOS gene expression. Luteolin decreased NO production in the blood of LPS-treated animals and the number of iNOS-positive cells in these animals. Our results suggest that changes in tissue NO levels caused by natural compounds cannot be predicted from their effect on NOS expression or activity obtained in model systems. This stresses the importance of direct measurements of NO and NOS expression in animal tissues."
0,"The present study was carried out to evaluate the protective role of lycopene on cytotoxicity induced by mercury in albino mice. The animals were randomly divided into seven groups. Group I (control) were treated with tap water Group II (positive control) were treated with 20 mg kg(-1) d(-1) lycopene, Group III were treated with 10 mg kg(-1) body weight mercury Group IV were treated with 10 mg kg(-1) body weight mercury + 5 mg kg(-1) d(-1) lycopene, Group V were treated with 10 mg kg(-1) body weight mercury + 10 mg kg(-1) d(-1) lycopene, Group VI were treated with 10 mg kg(-1) body weight mercury + 15 mg kg(-1) d(-1) lycopene, Group VII were treated with 10 mg kg(-1) body weight mercury + 20 mg kg(-1) d(-1) lycopene once a day for 20 consecutive days by oral gavage. The initial and final weights of all mice were measured by sensitive balance in order to investigate the effect of mercury and lycopene on the body weight of mice. Then, MN slides were prepared using the standard MN assay technique with Giemsa staining from erythrocyte cells of each mouse and were scored using binocular light microscope (Japan, Olympus BX 51). The results indicated that, all lycopene-supplemented lymphocytes showed a lower MN frequency than lymphocytes in only mercury-treated group. It was seen that lycopene had protective effect on MN particularly at 20 mg kg(-1) d(-1) dose when compared with the other doses. Besides, weight gain increased depending on dose of applied lycopene when compared with only mercury-treated group. In histopathological examinations, although it has been observed severe changes such as hemorrhage, hepatocyte degeneration and tubular degeneration of kidney in only mercury-treated group, there was an observable regression on the severity and account of these lesions in tissues of mice supplemented with different doses of lycopene. In vivo results showed that the lycopene supplementation decreases cytotoxicity induced by mercury and its protective role is dose-dependent."
0,"Increasing evidence suggests that lycopene may protect against atherosclerosis, although, the exact mechanism(s) is still unknown. Because lycopene is an efficient antioxidant, it has been proposed for a long time that this property may be responsible for its beneficial effects. Consistent with this, the carotenoid has been demonstrated to inhibit ROS production in vitro and to protect LDL from oxidation. However, recently, other mechanisms have been evoked and include: prevention of endothelial injury; modulation of lipid metabolism through a control of cholesterol synthesis and oxysterol toxic activities; reduction of inflammatory response through changes in cytokine production; inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation through regulation of molecular pathways involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Focusing on cell culture studies, this review summarizes the experimental evidence for a role of lycopene in the different phases of atherosclerotic process."
0,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a major health concern that is likely to have an increasing impact in line with the gradual aging of the population. BPH is characterized by smooth muscle and epithelial proliferation primarily within the prostatic transition zone that can cause a variety of problems for patients, the most frequent are the lower urinary tract symptoms. BPH is thought to involve in disruption of dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-supported homeostasis between cell proliferation and cell death, and, as a result, proliferative processes predominate and apoptotic processes are inhibited. Phytotherapeutic supplements, mainly based on Saw Palmetto-derived Serenoa Repens (SeR), are numerous and used frequently. Serenoa Repens reduces inflammation and decreases in vivo the androgenic support to prostatic cell growth. Furthermore, SeR stimulates the apoptotic machinery; however, data supporting efficacy is limited, making treatment recommendations difficult. Besides SeR, selenium (Se), an essential trace element mainly functioning through selenoproteins and able to promote an optimal antioxidant/oxidant balance, and lycopene (Ly), a dietary carotenoid synthesized by plants, fruits, and microorganisms with a strong antioxidant activity, has been shown to exert beneficial effects in prostate disease. SeR is frequently associated with Ly and Se, in order to increase its therapeutic activity in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It has been shown that the Ly-Se-SeR association has a greater and enhanced antiinflammatory activity that might be of particular interest in the treatment of BPH. The Ly-Se-SeR association is also more effective than SeR alone in reducing prostate weight and hyperplasia, in augmenting the pro-apoptotic Bax and caspase-9 and blunting the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 mRNA. In addition, Ly-Se-SeR more efficiently suppresses the EGF and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) expressions in hyperplastic prostates. Therefore, SeR particularly when combined with Se and Ly may have a greater potential for the management of benign prostate hyperplasia."
0,"The mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity remains controversial. Wistar rats (n=96) were randomly assigned to a control (C), lycopene (L), doxorubicin (D), or doxorubicin+lycopene (DL) group. The L and DL groups received lycopene (5 mg/kg body wt/day by gavage) for 7 weeks. The D and DL groups received doxorubicin (4 mg/kg body wt intraperitoneally) at 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks and were killed at 7 weeks for analyses. Myocardial tissue lycopene levels and total antioxidant performance (TAP) were analyzed by HPLC and fluorometry, respectively. Lycopene metabolism was determined by incubating (2)H(10)-lycopene with intestinal mucosa postmitochondrial fraction and lipoxygenase and analyzed with HPLC and APCI mass spectroscopy. Myocardial tissue lycopene levels in DL and L were similar. TAP adjusted for tissue protein were higher in myocardium of D than those of C (P=0.002). Lycopene metabolism study identified a lower oxidative cleavage of lycopene in D as compared to those of C. Our results showed that lycopene was not depleted in myocardium of lycopene-supplemented rats treated with doxorubicin and that higher antioxidant capacity in myocardium and less oxidative cleavage of lycopene in intestinal mucosa of doxorubicin-treated rats suggest an antioxidant role of doxorubicin rather than acting as a prooxidant."
0,"Doxorubicin is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent utilized for several types of cancer but the irreversible doxorubicin-induced cardiac damage is the major limitation for its use. Oxidative stress seems to be associated with some phase of the toxicity mechanism process. To determine if lycopene protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, male Wistar rats were randomly assigned either to control, lycopene, doxorubicin or doxorubicin + lycopene groups. They received corn oil (control, doxorubicin) or lycopene (5 mg/kg body weight a day) (lycopene, doxorubicin + lycopene) by gavage for a 7-week period. They also received saline (control, lycopene) or doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) (doxorubicin, doxorubin + lycopene) intraperitoneally by week 3, 4, 5 and 6. Animals underwent echocardiogram and were killed for tissue analyses by week 7. Mean lycopene levels (nmol/kg) in liver were higher in the doxorubicin + lycopene group (5822.59) than in the lycopene group (2496.73), but no differences in lycopene were found in heart or plasma of these two groups. Lycopene did not prevent left ventricular systolic dysfunction induced by doxorubicin. However, morphologic examination revealed that doxorubicin-induced myocyte damage was significantly suppressed in rats treated with lycopene. Doxorubicin treatment was followed by increase of myocardium interstitial collagen volume fraction. Our results show that: (i) doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was confirmed by echocardiogram and morphological evaluations; (ii) lycopene absorption was confirmed by its levels in heart, liver and plasma; (iii) lycopene supplementation provided myocyte protection without preventing interstitial collagen accumulation increase; (iv) doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction was not prevented by lycopene supplementation; and (v) lycopene depletion was not observed in plasma and tissues from animals treated with doxorubicin."
0,"The efficacy of lycopene to limit myocardial injury after ischemia and reperfusion was explored in the present study. Adult male albino Wistar rats were divided into three experimental groups and orally received olive oil as vehicle (sham and control I-R) or lycopene 1 mg/kg dissolved in olive oil (lycopene treated group) respectively for 31 days. On the 31st day, animals of the control I-R and lycopene treated groups were subjected to 45 min of occlusion of the LAD coronary artery and were thereafter reperfused for 1 h. The ischemia-reperfusion injury resulted in significant cardiac necrosis, depression in hemodynamics, decline in antioxidant status and rise in lipid peroxidation product levels in the control I-R group as compared to sham control. In histopathological examinations myocardial damage produced after I-R was significantly prevented in the lycopene treated group. Lycopene treatment resulted in preservation of the myocardial antioxidant status and altered hemodynamic parameters as compared to control I-R group. Furthermore, I-R-induced lipid peroxidation was significantly inhibited in the lycopene treated group. These beneficial cardioprotective effects also translated into the functional recovery of the heart. The beneficial effect of lycopene likely results from the suppression of oxidative stress, which results in the reduction of myocardial injury."
0,"Leiomyomas (fibroids) are benign tumors of the uterus affecting millions of women. Spontaneous leiomyomas of the oviduct are common tumors of the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica), which makes it a good animal model for screening potential agents for testing in the prevention and treatment of human myoma uteri. Because dietary intake of lycopene has been associated with a reduced risk of a variety of human cancers, we investigated the effects of lycopene supplementation on the development of leiomyomas in the oviduct of Japanese quail. We also measured serum levels of oxidative stress markers [malondialdehyde (MDA) and homocysteine], lycopene, vitamins C, E, and A, and tissue biomarkers Bcl-2 and Bax expression. One hundred twenty quails (6 mo old) were assigned to 3 treatment groups consisting of 4 replicates of 10 birds in each group. Birds were fed either a basal diet (group C) or the basal diet supplemented with 100 mg (group L1) or 200 mg (group L2) of lycopene per kilogram of diet. The animals were sacrificed after 285 days and the tumors were identified. Lycopene supplementation decreased the number of leiomyomas compared with control subjects (P=0.056). The tumors in lycopene-fed birds were smaller than those found in control birds (P=0.01). There were no significant differences in the expression of tissue Bcl-2 and Bax among the study groups. Serum vitamins C, E, and A increased (P=0.01), whereas MDA and homocysteine concentrations decreased (P=0.01) with lycopene supplementation. No measurable lycopene could be detected in the serum of control birds, whereas a dose-dependent increase was observed in the serum of lycopene-supplemented birds. The results indicate that dietary supplementation with lycopene reduces the incidence and size of spontaneously occurring leiomyoma of the oviduct in the Japanese quail. Clinical trials should be conducted to investigate the efficacy of lycopene supplementation in the prevention and treatment of uterine leiomyoma in humans."
0,"Prostate stromal and epithelial cell communication is important in prostate functioning and cancer development. Primary human stromal cells from normal prostate stromal cells (PRSC) maintain a smooth muscle phenotype, whereas those from prostate cancer (6S) display reactive and fibroblastic characteristics. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulates insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) production by 6S but not PSRC cells. Effects of reactive versus normal stroma on normal human prostate epithelial (NPE or PREC) cells are poorly understood. We co-cultured NPE plus 6S or PRSC cells to compare influences of different stromal cells on normal epithelium. Because NPE and PREC cells lose androgen receptor (AR) expression in culture, DHT effects must be modulated by associated stromal cells. When treated with camptothecin (CM), NPE cells, alone and in stromal co-cultures, displayed a dose-dependent increase in DNA fragmentation. NPE/6S co-cultures exhibited reduced CM-induced cell death with exposure to DHT, whereas NPE/PRSC co-cultures exhibited CM-induced cell death regardless of DHT treatment. DHT blocked CM-induced, IGF-I-mediated, NPE death in co-cultured NPE/6S cells without, but not with, added anti-IGF-I and anti-IGF-R antibodies. Lycopene consumption is inversely related to human prostate cancer risk and inhibits IGF-I and androgen signaling in rat prostate cancer. In this study, lycopene, in dietary concentrations, reversed DHT effects of 6S cells on NPE cell death, decreased 6S cell IGF-I production by reducing AR and beta-catenin nuclear localization and inhibited IGF-I-stimulated NPE and PREC growth, perhaps by attenuating IGF-I's effects on serine phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta and tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK3. This study expands the understanding of the preventive mechanisms of lycopene in prostate cancer."
0,"The aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective role of lycopene on adriamycin (ADR)-induced heart and kidney toxicity using biochemical and histopathological approaches. Rats were randomly divided into four groups. The first group received no medication and was regarded as the control group; the second group was injected with a single dose of ADR; the third group was treated with lycopene for 10 days before ADR injection and the last group was treated with lycopene for 2 days before and for 3 days after the administration of a single dose of ADR. ADR (10mg/kg) was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected as a single dose and lycopene (4 mg/kg) was administered in corn oil by gavage. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in both the heart and kidneys were higher in the group treated with ADR alone than in the control group, and were lower in the groups administered with lycopene than in the ADR alone group. Although the activity of catalase (CAT) in the heart was higher in the ADR alone group than in the control group, it was lower in the kidneys. In particular, treatment with lycopene post-injection normalized both cardiac and kidney CAT activities. In heart and kidney tissues, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were not significantly different between all groups. Significant increases in the levels of plasma creatinine and urea were observed in the ADR group when compared to the control group, and these increases were normalized by lycopene treatment. Cardiac and renal histopathological changes were observed in the ADR group as compared to the control group. In contrast, these histopathological changes appeared nearly normal in the groups treated with lycopene pre- and post-injection. In conclusion, this study clearly indicated that ADR treatment markedly impaired cardiac and renal function and that treatment with lycopene might prevent this toxicity in rats."
0,"Tomato and its major antioxidant component lycopene have recently been focused as important antioxidant nutrients because of their ability to reduce reactive oxygen species and to provide health benefits. Most of the studies were undertaken to determine the usefulness of lycopene against cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Epidemiological studies, however, yielded conflicting results. This study was undertaken to compare cardioprotective abilities of tomato juice and lycopene. Rats were gavaged either tomato juice or lycopene for 3 weeks. At the end of 3 weeks, isolated hearts were subjected to 30 min ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Both tomato juice and lycopene reduced the extent of lipid peroxidation; but only tomato juice, but not lycopene, improved post-ischemic ventricular function, and reduced myocardial infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The results indicated for the first time that tomato juice, but not lycopene, possesses cardioprotective ability."
0,"Free radicals are chemicals that play roles in the etio-pathogenesis of ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Various antioxidants have been used in an attempt to mitigate the damage induced by these chemicals. In the present study, the antioxidative effects of grape seed extract (proanthocyanidin), tomato extract (lycopene), and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) on a composite re-established-flow inferior epigastric artery based rectus abdominis muscle-skin flap model on which experimental ischaemia was induced were investigated. The rats have been administered antioxidants for 2 weeks prior to the surgery and for 2 more weeks thereafter. Macroscopic, histopathological, and biochemical analyses were carried out at the decision of the experiment. It was found that flap skin island necrosis was significantly reduced in the proanthocyanidin, lycopene, vitamin C groups (p < 0.001). Statistical analyses showed significant decreases in inflammation, oedema, congestion, and granulation tissue in the proanthocyanidin and lycopene groups compared to the vitamin C and control groups (p < 0.001). When the viability rates of fat and muscle tissues were examined, significant improvements were found in the proanthocyanidin and lycopene groups in comparison to the other groups (p < 0.001). Serum antioxidant capacity measurements revealed significant differences in the lycopene group compared to all other groups (p < 0.001). It is concluded that lycopene and proanthocyanidin are protective antioxidants in rat composite muscle-skin flap ischaemia-reperfusion models."
0,"We investigated the preventive effect of lycopene on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-induced by high-fat diet in rats. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups. They were fed standard diet, high-fat diet (HFD), high-fat diet plus lycopene at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight and the high-fat diet lycopene at a dose of 4 mg/kg BW for a period of 6 weeks. Inflammation, steatosis, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP 2E1) expression increased significantly in the rats fed HFD and decreased in the rats administered by lycopene. Significantly elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), tumor necrosis factor (TNF α), and serum and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) were observed in rats fed the high-fat diet as compared to the control rats (P < .01). Supplementation with lycopene lowered serum MDA and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) levels and elevated liver GSH level (P < .001). Insulin resistance was higher in the rats fed HFD than in rats supplemented with lycopene. The data indicate that supplementation with lycopene can reduce high-fat diet-induced oxidative stress to the cells."
0,"The protective effect of tomato extract and lycopene on acute doxorubicin (DOX) myocardial toxicity was evaluated in mice. DOX toxicity, induced by a single intraperitoneal injection (15 mg/kg), was revealed by an elevated serum CPK(MB) and histopathological observations. Tomato extract (1.2 and 2.4 g/kg, i.p.) and lycopene (1.7 and 3.5 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented the rise in serum CPK(MB) and ameliorated cardiac cell injury. These results suggest that tomato extract and lycopene inhibit DOX cardiotoxicity and might serve as a novel combination chemotherapeutic agent with DOX to limit free radical-mediated organ injury."
0,"Doxorubicin is a highly active antineoplastic agent, but its clinical use is limited because of its cardiotoxicity. Although nutraceuticals endowed with anti-inflammatory properties exert cardioprotective activity, their bioavailability and stability are inconsistent. In an attempt to address this issue, we evaluated whether bioavailable nanoemulsions loaded with nutraceuticals (curcumin and fresh and dry tomato extracts rich in lycopene) protect cardiomyoblasts (H9C2 cells) from doxorubicin-induced toxicity. Nanoemulsions were produced with a high-pressure homogenizer. H9C2 cells were incubated with nanoemulsions loaded with different nutraceuticals alone or in combination with doxorubicin. Cell viability was evaluated with a modified MTT method. The levels of the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-butanone (4-HNA), and of the cardiotoxic-related interleukins IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and nitric oxide were analyzed in cardiomyoblasts. The hydrodynamic size of nanoemulsions was around 100 nm. Cell viability enhancement was 35⁻40% higher in cardiomyoblasts treated with nanoemulsion + doxorubicin than in cardiomyoblasts treated with doxorubicin alone. Nanoemulsions also protected against oxidative stress as witnessed by a reduction of MDA and 4-HNA. Notably, nanoemulsions inhibited the release of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, TNF-α and nitric oxide by around 35⁻40% and increased IL-10 production by 25⁻27% versus cells not treated with emulsions. Of the nutraceuticals evaluated, lycopene-rich nanoemulsions had the best cardioprotective profile. In conclusion, nanoemulsions loaded with the nutraceuticals described herein protect against cardiotoxicity, by reducing inflammation and lipid oxidative stress. These results set the stage for studies in preclinical models."
0,"Metabolic engineering of mammalian cells has to-date focused primarily on biopharmaceutical protein production or the manipulation of native metabolic processes towards therapeutic aims. However, significant potential exists for expanding these techniques to diverse applications by looking across the taxonomic tree to bioactive metabolites not synthesized in animals. Namely, cross-taxa metabolic engineering of mammalian cells could offer value in applications ranging fromfood and nutrition to regenerative medicine and gene therapy. Towards the former, recent advances in meat production through cell culture suggest the potential to produce meat with fine cellular control, where tuning composition through cross-taxa metabolic engineering could enhance nutrition and food-functionality. Here we demonstrate this possibility by engineering primary bovine and immortalized murine muscle cells with prokaryotic enzymes to endogenously produce the antioxidant carotenoids phytoene, lycopene and β-carotene. These phytonutrients offer general nutritive value and protective effects against diseases associated with red and processed meat consumption, and so offer a promising proof-of-concept for nutritional engineering in cultured meat. We demonstrate the phenotypic integrity of engineered cells, the ability to tune carotenoid yields, and the antioxidant functionality of these compounds in vitro towards both nutrition and food-quality objectives. Our results demonstrate the potential for tailoring the nutritional profile of cultured meats. They further lay a foundation for heterologous metabolic engineering of mammalian cells for applications outside of the clinical realm."
0,"The present study determined if acute exercise increased free radical formation in human skeletal muscle. Vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained in a randomized balanced order from six males at rest and following single-leg knee extensor exercise performed for 2 min at 50% of maximal work rate (WR(MAX)) and 3 min at 100% WR(MAX). EPR spectroscopy revealed an exercise-induced increase in mitochondrial ubisemiquinone (UQ*-) [0.167 +/- 0.055 vs. rest: 0.106 +/- 0.047 arbitrary units (AU)/g total protein (TP), P < 0.05] and alpha-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone-adducts (112 +/- 41 vs. rest: 29 +/- 9 AU/mg tissue mass, P < 0.05). Intramuscular lipid hydroperoxides also increased (0.320 +/- 0.263 vs. rest: 0.148 +/- 0.071 nmol/mg TP, P < 0.05) despite an uptake of alpha-tocopherol, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene. There were no relationships between mitochondrial volume density and any biomarkers of oxidative stress. These findings provide the first direct evidence for intramuscular free radical accumulation and lipid peroxidation following acute exercise in humans."
0,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent stimulator of growth and motility of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Abnormalities of PDGF/PDGF receptor (PDGFR) are thought to contribute to vascular diseases and malignancy. We previously showed that a carotenoid, lycopene, can directly bind to PDGF and affect its related functions in VSMCs. In this study we examined the effect of the other naturally occurring carotenoid, lutein, on PDGF signaling and migration in VSMCs."
1,Western blotting was performed to examine PDGF and H₂O₂ signaling. Flowcytometry was used to determine PDGF binding to VSMCs. Fluorescence microscopy was performed to examine intracellular ROS production. Modified Boyden chamber system (Transwell apparatus) was used for migration assay.
2,"Lutein reduced PDGF signaling, including phosphorylation of PDGFR-β and its downstream protein kinases/enzymes such as phospholipase C-γ, Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Although lutein possesses a similar structure to lycopene, it was striking that lutein inhibited PDGF signaling through a different way from lycopene in VSMCs. Unlike lycopene, lutein not only interacted with (bound to) PDGF but also interfered with cellular components. This was evidenced that preincubation of PDGF with lutein and treatment of VSMCs with lutein followed by removing of lutein compromised PDGF-induced signaling. Lutein reduced PDGF-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and attenuated ROS- (H₂O₂-) induced ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation. A further analysis indicated lutein could inhibit a higher concentration of H₂O₂-induced PDGFR signaling, which is known to act through an oxidative inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase. Finally, we showed that lutein functionally inhibited PDGF-induced VSMC migration, whereas its stereo-isomer zeaxanthin did not, revealing a special action of lutein on VSMCs."
3,Our study reveals a differential action mechanism of lutein from other reported caroteinoids and suggests a possible beneficial effect of lutein but not zeaxanthin on prevention of vascular diseases.
0,"Mitochondrial free radical formation has been implicated as a potential mechanism underlying degenerative senescence, although human data are lacking. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine if resting and exercise-induced intramuscular free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation is indeed increased across the spectrum of sedentary aging. Biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis in six young (26 + or - 6 yr) and six aged (71 + or - 6 yr) sedentary males at rest and after maximal knee extensor exercise. Aged tissue exhibited greater (P < 0.05 vs. the young group) electron paramagnetic resonance signal intensity of the mitochondrial ubisemiquinone radical both at rest (+138 + or - 62%) and during exercise (+143 + or - 40%), and this was further complemented by a greater increase in alpha-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone adducts identified as a combination of lipid-derived alkoxyl-alkyl radicals (+295 + or - 96% and +298 + or - 120%). Lipid hydroperoxides were also elevated at rest (0.190 + or - 0.169 vs. 0.148 + or - 0.071 nmol/mg total protein) and during exercise (0.567 + or - 0.259 vs. 0.320 + or - 0.263 nmol/mg total protein) despite a more marked depletion of ascorbate and uptake of alpha/beta-carotene, retinol, and lycopene (P < 0.05 vs. the young group). The impact of senescence was especially apparent when oxidative stress biomarkers were expressed relative to the age-related decline in mitochondrial volume density and absolute power output at maximal exercise. In conclusion, these findings confirm that intramuscular free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation is elevated at rest and during acute exercise in aged humans."
0,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is an efficient chemotherapeutic agent used against several types of tumors; however, its use is limited due to severe cardiotoxicity. Since it is accepted that reactive oxygen species are involved in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, antioxidant agents have been used to attenuate its side effects. To determine tomato-oleoresin protection against cardiac oxidative DNA damage induced by DOX, we distributed Wistar male rats in control (C), lycopene (L), DOX (D) and DOX+lycopene (DL) groups. They received corn oil (C, D) or tomato-oleoresin (5mg/kg body wt. day) (L, DL) by gavage for a 7-week period. They also received saline (C, L) or DOX (4mg/kg body wt.) (D, DL) intraperitoneally at the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and at 6th week. Lycopene absorption was checked by HPLC. Cardiac oxidative DNA damage was evaluated by the alkaline Comet assay using formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (FPG) and endonuclease III (endo III). Cardiomyocyte levels of SBs, SBs FPG and SBs Endo III were higher in rats from D when compared to other groups. DNA damage levels in cardiomyocytes from DL were not different when compared to C and L groups. The viability of cardiomyocytes from D or DL was lower than C or L groups (p<0.01). Lycopene levels (mean+/-S.D.nmol/kg) in saponified hearts were similar between L (47.43+/-11.78) and DL (49.85+/-16.24) groups. Our results showed: (1) lycopene absorption was confirmed by its cardiac levels; (2) DOX-induced oxidative DNA damage in cardiomyocyte; (3) tomato-oleoresin supplementation protected against cardiomyocyte oxidative DNA damage."

1,"The relationships of osteophyte formation on plain lumbar radiographs with serum levels of antioxidants (carotenoids, vitamin A, vitamin E) and other factors were investigated to examine whether antioxidants are involved in lumbar spine degeneration."
2,"Antioxidants have inhibitory effects on the onset of many diseases. However, the association of lumbar osteophyte formation with antioxidant levels in the general population has not been investigated."
3,"The subjects were 286 people (103 men and 183 women; mean age = 68 years) who underwent resident health screening. Osteophyte formation on lumbar lateral radiographs (Nathan classification), lumbar lordosis angles, sacral inclination angles, serum levels of antioxidants, triglyceride levels, body mass index, osteoporosis, back muscle strength, history of alcohol intake, and smoking history were studied in these subjects."
4,"Lumbar osteophyte formation was detected in 48 subjects (17%). Osteophyte formation was significantly more common in elderly persons, men, and subjects with a history of alcohol intake; and had a significant correlation with sacral inclination angle. The levels of α-tocopherol, β-tocopherol, zeaxanthin/lutein, cryptoxanthin, lycopene, α-carotene, and β-carotene were significantly lower in subjects with osteophytes. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for all factors showed that a higher age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.16; P = 0.02) and a low β-carotene level (OR = 6.7, 95% CI = 1.39-32.6; P = 0.02) were risk factors for osteophyte formation."
5,"The serum levels of carotenoids and vitamin E were significantly lower in subjects with lumbar osteophyte formation, and a low β-carotene level was the strongest risk factor for lumbar osteophytes. This is the first evidence of an association between carotenoids and lumbar osteophyte formation. This finding suggests that appropriate dietary intake of antioxidants is important for inhibition of lumbar spine degeneration in a rapidly aging society."
0,"Considering the importance of inflammation on obesity-related disorders pathogenesis, including cardiac dysfunction, the interest in natural anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies has emerged. The lycopene is a carotenoid presents in tomato and red fruits that displays anti-inflammatory properties. In this sense, we will evaluate the anti-inflamma- tory effect of tomato-oleoresin supplementation on obesity- related cardiac dysfunction by modulating myocardial calcium kinetic."
1,"Male Wistar rats were initially randomized into 2 experimental groups: (Control, n= 20) or high sugar- fat diet (HSF, n=20) for 20 weeks. At week 20<sup>th</sup>, once detected the cardiac dysfunction (cardiac remodeling, systolic and diastolic dysfunction) by echocardiography in HSF group, animals were randomly divided to begin the treatment with tomato-oleoresin, performing 4 groups: Control (n= 10); Control + tomato tomato-oleoresin supplementation (Control + Ly, n= 10); HSF (n= 10) or HSF + tomato tomato-oleoresin supplementation (HSF + Ly, n= 10). Tomato oleoresin was mixed with maize oil equivalent to 10mg lycopene/kg body weight (BW) per day and given orally, by gavage, every morning for a 10-week period. It was analyzed cardiac inflammatory parameters by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in vivo (echocardiography) and in vitro (studying isolated papillary muscles from the left ventricle) cardiac function. The groups were compared by Two-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA)."
2,"The HSF diet induced cardiac dysfunction (FS(%) C: 60.4±1.3; C+Ly: 60.9±1.3; HSF: 51.7±1.3; HSF+Ly: 59.4±1.4) and inflammation (TNF-α: C:1.88±0.41; C+Ly: 1.93±1.01; HSF: 4.58±1.99; HSF+Ly: 2.03±0.55; IL-6: C:0.58±0.16; C+Ly: 0.40±0.16; HSF: 2.00±0.45; HSF+Ly: 0.53±0.26; MCP-1: C:0.31±0.08; C+Ly: 0.43±0.22; HSF: 1.54±0.32; HSF+Ly: 0.50±0.16). Tomato-oleoresin supplementation improved cardiac remodeling and dysfunction, cardiac inflammation and myocardial calcium kinetic."

0,"Lycopene, a carotenoid rich in tomato fruit (ripe), is an effective antioxidant and free radical scavenger. In this study n-hexane extract of tomato was evaluated for its protective action against oxidative stress in experimental myocardial infarction induced by administration of adrenaline in rats. Adrenaline produced significant elevation of malondialdehyde content of heart, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, with a significant rise in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level and different grades of necrotic changes in myocardium. Rats were treated with two doses of n-hexane extract of tomato, intragastrically daily for one month prior to administration of adrenaline on the 31st and 32nd day. Pretreatment of tomato extract (1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg) and vitamin E (50 mg/kg) significantly reduced the malondialdehyde concentration in heart and significantly lowered the serum AST level in adrenaline treated rats. Myocardial necrosis was significantly prevented by pretreatment. These results suggest that n-hexane extract of tomato possesses antioxidative property that may protect heart against catecholamine induced myocardial infarction."
0,"The aim of this present work is to describe the nature and extent of fibrosis within muscle and to correlate this with the mouth opening (MO) in OSE patients and to prove our results in improvement of mouth opening in patients with OSMF with use of ""muscle relaxants"" along with other modalities of treatment . The study was conducted on 40 patients who visited our outpatient department with grade 3 (<19 mm) mouth opening. 20 of these patients underwent the routine treatment protocol of weekly injection of hyaluronidase with hydrocortisone and antioxidant capsules with added lycopene for 1 month. The remaining test subjects in addition to the routine injections and antioxidants were given skeletal muscle relaxants like thiocolchicoside or chlorzoxazone. The mouth opening (interincisal distance of maxillary and mandibular incisors at maximum possible mouth opening) was measured and graded as follows: grade 1 (>40 mm), grade 2 (20-39 mm) and grade 3 (<19 mm) with the help of vernier callipers after the study period of 1 month. 17 out of the 20 test patients who received muscle relaxants in addition to the routine protocol showed marked improvement with shift from grade 3 (<19 mm) to grade 1 (>40 mm) i.e. a greater than 20 mm improvement in mouth opening. Using muscle relaxants as a adjuvant therapy in the routine protocol of treatment of oral submucosal fibrosis will not only cater and halt the problem of fibrosis but also will take care of the muscle spasm and inflammation which also inadvertently contribute to the restricted mouth opening. We found excellent improvement on adding muscle relaxants to the routine protocol which was not just an objective but also a subjective success."
0,"We assessed the prevention of hepatic fibrogenesis by a herbal medicine Sho-saiko-to or a carotenoid lycopene in Long-Evans rats with cinnamon coat color (LEC rats). LEC rats were divided into three groups: A (n=40), fed on a basal diet (BD); B (n=25), fed on BD plus 1% Sho-saiko-to; and C (n=40), fed on BD plus 0.005% lycopene. All rats were sacrificed at 76 weeks of age. The liver tissues were stained with Azan--Mallory and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). The malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver was measured for the assay of lipoperoxides. The percentage of the total area stained was determined morphometrically. The percentage of the total area involved by fibrosis was 1.35plus minus0.56 in group A, 0.72plus minus0.34 in B (P=0.0020, B vs. A) and 0.78plus minus0.75 in C (P=0.0031, C vs. A). The percentage of the total area that was stained for alpha-SMA was 0.61plus minus0.57 in group A, 0.11plus minus0.05 in B (P=0.0017, B vs. A) and 0.12plus minus0.06 in C (P=0.0021, C vs. A). In group B, MDA in the liver was lower than in group C (P=0.009). In group C, the concentration of iron in the liver was lower than in group A (P=0.0059). In conclusion, Sho-saiko-to suppressed fibrogenesis through reduced generation of lipid peroxides. Hepatic fibrogenesis was also suppressed by lycopene. The mechanisms of this preventive effect of fibrogenesis with Sho-saiko-to and lycopene were suggested to inhibit the stellate cell activity."
0,"This study aimed to determine the effects of 4 wk of antioxidants (AOX) supplementation on exercise-induced lipid peroxidation, muscle damage, and inflammation in kayakers."
1,"Subjects (n = 20) were randomly assigned to receive a placebo (PLA) or an AOX capsule (AOX; 272 mg of alpha-tocopherol, 400 mg of vitamin C, 30 mg of beta-carotene, 2 mg of lutein, 400 mug of selenium, 30 mg of zinc, and 600 mg of magnesium). Blood samples were collected at rest and 15 min after a 1000-m kayak race, both before and after the supplementation period, for analysis of alpha-tocopherol, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein plus zeaxanthin, vitamin C, uric acid, total AOX status (TAS), thiobarbituric reactive acid substances (TBARS) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and creatine kinase (CK), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (Gr), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities."
2,"With supplementation, plasma alpha-tocopherol (P = 0.003) and beta-carotene (P = 0.007) augmented significantly in the AOX group. IL-6 (exercise, P = 0.039), TBARS (exercise, P < 0.001), and uric acid (exercise, P = 0.032) increased significantly in response to the exercise regardless of treatment group. Cortisol level raised more from pre- to postsupplementation period in the PLA group (time x supplementation, P = 0.002). Although TAS declined after exercise before intervention, it increased above preexercise values after the 4-wk period in the AOX group (supplementation x time x exercise, P = 0.034). CK increased after exercise in both groups (exercise effect, P < 0.001) and decreased from week 0 to week 4 more markedly in the PLA group (supplementation x time, P = 0.049)."
3,AOX supplementation does not offer protection against exercise-induced lipid peroxidation and inflammation and may hinder the recovery of muscle damage.
0,"In this study, the impact of cerium oxide nanoparticles on the nutritional value of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) fruit grown in soil infested with <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lycopersici</i> was investigated in a greenhouse pot study. Three-week old seedlings of Bonny Best tomato plants were exposed by foliar and soil routes to nanoparticle CeO<sub>2</sub> (NP CeO<sub>2</sub>) and cerium acetate (CeAc) at 0, 50, and 250 mg/L and transplanted into pots containing a soil mixture infested with the <i>Fusarium</i> wilt pathogen. Fruit biomass, water content, diameter, and nutritional content (lycopene, reducing and total sugar) along with elemental composition, including Ce, were evaluated. Fruit Ce concentration was below the detection limit in all treatments. Foliar exposure to NP CeO<sub>2</sub> at 250 increased the fruit dry weight (67%) and lycopene content (9%) in infested plants, compared with the infested untreated control. Foliar exposure to CeAc at 50 mg/L reduced fruit fresh weight (46%) and water content (46%) and increased the fruit lycopene content by 11% via root exposure as compared with the untreated infested control. At 250 mg/L, CeAc increased fruit dry weight (94%), compared with the infested untreated control. Total sugar content decreased in fruits of infested plants exposed via roots to NP CeO<sub>2</sub> at 50 mg/kg (63%) and 250 mg/kg (54%), CeAc at 50 mg/kg (46%), and foliarly at 50 mg/L (50%) and 250 mg/L (50%), all compared with the infested untreated control. Plants grown in <i>Fusarium</i>-infested soil had decreased fruit dry weight (42%) and lycopene content (17%) and increased total sugar (60%) and Ca content (140%), when compared with the noninfested untreated control (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). Overall, the data suggested minimal negative effects of NP CeO<sub>2</sub> on the nutritional value of tomato fruit while simultaneously suppressing <i>Fusarium</i> wilt disease."
0,"Although several micronutrients deficiency were reported to be associated with poor muscle function, however information on sarcopenia patients is still lacking. The aim of this report was to measure some micronutrients blood-based status in sarcopenia patients during both acute illness and recovery."
1,"We assessed nutritional status of randomly selected hospitalised patients using anthropometric, haematological and biochemical data at baseline, 6 weeks and at 6 months. Sarcopenia was diagnosed from low muscle mass and low muscle strength using anthropometric measures based on the European Working Group criteria. Micronutrient status was compared between sarcopenia patients and those without sarcopenia over a 6 months period."
2,"Forty-four out of 432 patients (10%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia on admission. Patients diagnosed with sarcopenia had lower micronutrients concentrations compared to those patients without sarcopenia however, the results were statistically significant only for baseline serum albumin, red cell folate and plasma zinc (p < 0.05). Lycopene, retinol, red cell folate and zinc were also significantly lower in sarcopenia patients at 6 weeks. Sarcopenia patients readmitted to hospital had poor baseline micronutrient status compared with sarcopenia patients stayed in the community during the 6-months follow up period but differences were not statistically significant. Both baseline serum albumin and plasma zinc were significantly higher in sarcopenia patients who were alive compared with those died at 6 months follow up."
3,"Baseline serum albumin and plasma zinc concentrations were lower in patients diagnosed with sarcopenia compared to those without sarcopenia, and also in sarcopenia patients who died compared with those alive at 6 months follow up."
0,"Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is characterized by the presence of epiretinal membrane (ERM), which exerts traction and detaches the retina. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells underlies ERM formation. Adjuvant therapies aimed at preventing recurrence of PVR after surgery mostly failed in clinical trials. This study was aimed to evaluate the anti-EMT properties of bio-active compounds epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), curcumin and lycopene as inhibitors of EMT induced by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in cultured ARPE-19 cells."
1,"ARPE-19 cells were treated with TGF-β1 alone or co-treated with EGCG (1-50 μM), lycopene (1-10 μM) and curcumin (1-10 μM). The mRNA and protein expression of EMT markers, alpha-smooth muscle actin, vimentin, zonula occludens-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), were assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction/quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence/enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Activity of MMP-2 was assessed by zymography. Functional implications of EMT were assessed by proliferation assay (MTT assay) and migration assay (scratch assay). Western-blot for phosphorylated Smad-3 and total Smad-3 was done to delineate the mechanism."
2,"EGCG and curcumin at 10 μM concentration reversed EMT, inhibited proliferation and migration through Smad-3 phosphorylation, when induced by TGF-β1 in ARPE-19 cells. Lycopene did not prevent EMT in ARPE-19 cells."
3,"EGCG and curcumin are potent in preventing EMT induced by TGF-β1 in ARPE-19 cells and therefore, proposed as potential molecules for further pre-clinical evaluation in PVR management."
0,Lower antioxidant serum concentrations have been linked to declines in lean mass and physical function in older adults. Yet population data on the effect of dietary antioxidants on loss of muscle strength and physical function are lacking.
1,"We sought to determine the association of antioxidant intake [vitamin C, vitamin E, and total and individual carotenoids (α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein + zeaxanthin)] with annualized change in grip strength and gait speed in adults from the Framingham Offspring study."
2,"This prospective cohort study included participants with a valid FFQ at the index examination and up to 2 prior examinations and at ≥2 measures of primary outcomes: grip strength (n = 2452) and/or gait speed (n = 2422) measured over 3 subsequent examinations. Annualized change in grip strength (kg/y) and change in gait speed (m/s/y) over the follow-up period were used. Linear regression was used to calculate β coefficients and P values, adjusting for covariates."
3,"Mean ± SD age of participants was 61 ± 9 y (range: 33-88 y). Median intakes (IQR, mg/d) of vitamin C, vitamin E, and total carotenoid across available examinations were 209.2 (133.1-394.2), 27.1 (7.4-199.0), and 15.3 (10.4-21.3), respectively. The mean follow-up time was ∼12 ± 2 y (range: 4.5-15.4 y). In the sex-combined sample, higher intakes of total carotenoids, lycopene, and lutein + zeaxanthin were associated with increased annualized change in grip strength [β (SE) per 10-mg higher intake/d, range: 0.0316 (0.0146) to 0.1223 (0.0603) kg/y)]. All antioxidants except for vitamin C were associated with faster gait speed [β (SE) per 10-mg higher intake/d, range: 0.00008 (0.00004) to 0.0187 (0.0081) m/s/y]."
4,Higher antioxidant intake was associated with increase in grip strength and faster gait speed in this cohort of adults. This finding highlights the need for a randomized controlled trial of dietary antioxidants and their effect on muscle strength and physical function.
0,"Since the mid-1990s, the decline of the yellow perch population of Lake Saint-Pierre (hereinafter LSP) in Quebec, Canada has been the subject of several research programs. The combined effect of habitat deterioration, the presence of invasive species, and poor water quality negatively affected the yellow perch population in this lake. In 2013, we sampled yellow perch (larvae, juveniles and adults) at six sites along the St. Lawrence River representing a gradient of increasing human influences from upstream to downstream and measured several biomarkers including retinoid compounds (vitamin A). In the most contaminated sites (LSP, north and south shores), we found that retinoid stores were decreased in all three stages of development. To corroborate these results and to test other biomarkers, we once again sampled yellow perch (adults only) from the same sites. Results from our 2014 and 2015 samplings confirmed that LSP yellow perch appeared to be at a disadvantage compared to fish from upstream populations. Individuals from LSP have lower acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity as well as lower retinoid levels in liver and plasma. These fish were also marked by lower levels of antioxidants such as lycopene and vitamin E. A discriminant analysis of this set of results confirmed that the yellow perch of the LSP could be easily discriminated from those of the other sites (2014 and 2015) on the basis of liver retinoid and, to a lesser extent, of the liver tocopherol and protein concentration of the muscle, as well as AChE activity and DROH (all-trans-3,4-dehydroretinol) measured in plasma."
0,Low tissue concentrations of carotenoids have been suggested to contribute to insulin resistance in obesity.
1,"The objectives of the study were to 1) evaluate the relations of adipose tissue and serum carotenoids with body fat, abdominal fat distribution, muscle, adipose tissue and liver insulin resistance, and dietary intake; 2) evaluate the relations and distributions of carotenoids detected in adipose tissue and serum; and 3) compare serum carotenoids and retinol concentrations in subjects with and without obesity."
2,"Post hoc analysis of serum and adipose tissue carotenoids in individuals [n = 80; 31 men, 49 women; age (mean ± SEM): 51.4 ± 1.1 y] who participated in 2 separate studies conducted at the Clinical Research Facility at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research (Sydney) between 2008 and 2013. Retinol, α-carotene, β-carotene, ζ-carotene, lutein, lycopene, phytoene, and phytofluene were measured using HPLC. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Insulin resistance was measured by 2-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with deuterated glucose (n = 64), and subcutaneous and visceral abdominal volume and liver and pancreatic fat by MRI (n = 60). Periumbilical subcutaneous fat biopsy was performed and carotenoids and retinol measured in the tissue (n = 16)."
3,"We found that ζ-carotene, phytoene, and phytofluene were stored in considerable amounts in adipose tissue (25% of adipose tissue carotenoids). Carotenoid concentrations in adipose tissue and serum correlated significantly, but they followed different distributions: ζ-carotene was 3-fold higher in adipose tissue compared with serum, while lutein and lycopene made up 20% and 21% of serum carotenoids compared with 2% and 12% of adipose tissue carotenoids, respectively. Liver (P ≤ 0.028) and adipose tissue (P = 0.023), but not muscle (P ≥ 0.16), insulin resistance correlated inversely with many of the serum carotenoids."
4,"Multiple serum and adipose tissue carotenoids are associated with favorable metabolic traits, including insulin sensitivity in liver and adipose tissue in humans."
0,"Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are important biological markers of various myocardial disorders and exercise-induced muscle damage. Lycopene, on the other side, is a natural anti-oxidant with protective action against cardiovascular risk. Fifteen anaerobically trained athletes with elevated LDH and CPK baseline levels were enrolled in this study after undergoing thorough biochemical and cardiovascular evaluation with echocardiocraphy. In nine athletes tomato juice, a lycopene plain juice, was administered during and after exercise, replacing the carbohydrate supplementation beverages commonly used during training for over a 2-month period. Tomato juice administration significantly reduced LDH and CPK levels, which returned back to almost normal levels. At the same time homocysteine and C-reactive protein were also attenuated. No changes were observed in the control group, where the usual carbohydrate supplementation had been followed. "
0,"The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional effect of tomato pomace, in combination with two distinct fat sources (lard or soya bean oil), on longissimus lumborum muscle, subcutaneous fat and liver of young pigs. Forty male pigs of 4 weeks old were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments using two fibre sources (wheat bran or 5.0% tomato pomace) and two fat sources (lard or soya bean oil), in a 2 × 2 factorial design for a 5-week trial. Tomato pomace did not improve colour, fatty acid profile, cholesterol content or lipid oxidation, nor did it yield detectable levels in lycopene or β-carotene in the meat (p > 0.05). However, a positive increase in α-tocopherol content of meat and liver was observed in pigs fed tomato pomace (p < 0.05). Compared with lard, soya bean oil increased MUFA and PUFA proportions and decreased the percentage of SFA (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that 5.0% of tomato pomace increases pork oxidative stability and that 5.0% of soya bean oil, compared with lard, improves its nutritional quality."
0,A poor fat-soluble micronutrient (FMN) and a high oxidative stress status are associated with frailty. Our aim was to determine the cross-sectional association of FMNs and oxidative stress biomarkers [protein carbonyls (PrCarb) and 3-nitrotyrosine] with the frailty status in participants older than 65 years.
1,"Plasma levels of vitamins A (retinol), D<sub>3</sub> , E (α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol) and carotenoids (α-carotene and β-carotene, lycopene, lutein/zeaxanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin), PrCarb, and 3-nitrotyrosine were measured in 1450 individuals of the FRAILOMIC initiative. Participants were classified into robust, pre-frail, and frail using Fried's frailty criteria. Associations between biomarkers and frailty status were assessed by general linear and logistic regression models, both adjusted for cohort, season of blood sampling, gender, age, height, weight, and smoking."
2,"Robust participants had significantly higher vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and lutein/zeaxanthin concentrations than pre-frail and frail subjects; had significantly higher γ-tocopherol, α-carotene, β-carotene, lycopene, and β-cryptoxanthin concentrations than frail subjects, and had significantly lower PrCarb concentrations than frail participants in multivariate linear models. Frail subjects were more likely to be in the lowest than in the highest tertile for vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (adjusted odds ratio: 2.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.42-3.26), α-tocopherol (2.12; 1.39-3.24), α-carotene (1.69; 1.00-2.88), β-carotene (1.84; 1.13-2.99), lycopene (1.94; 1.24-3.05), lutein/zeaxanthin (3.60; 2.34-5.53), and β-cryptoxanthin (3.02; 1.95-4.69) and were more likely to be in the highest than in the lowest tertile for PrCarb (2.86; 1.82-4.49) than robust subjects in multivariate regression models."
3,Our study indicates that both low FMN and high PrCarb concentrations are associated with pre-frailty and frailty.
0,"Obesity is associated with increased risk of a number of serious medical conditions, including urological disorders. This study investigated the effect of lipidic extracts of saladette tomato pomace (STP) and Serenoa repens (SR) on the prostate and bladder in a rat obese model induced by high-carbohydrate diet."
1,"High-sucrose-fed rats showed higher prostate weight as well as increased contractility and stromal and epithelial hyperplasia in the prostate. Treatment with STP and SR improved contractility and diminished hyperplasia and hypertrophy in the prostate. Obese animals also showed impaired bladder contractility, but neither extract reversed this deterioration. In the histological study, a disarray in the process of smooth muscle cell proliferation with non-parallel fibers was observed; interestingly, treatment with STP and SR led to improvement in this derangement."
2,"These findings indicated impaired contractility and hyperplasia in the prostate and bladder of obese rats induced by high sucrose. STP and SR could enhance prostate function by reducing contractility and hyperplasia and improve smooth muscle fiber structure and decrease cell proliferation in the bladder, suggesting their possible health-beneficial effects on lower urinary tract symptoms. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry."
0,"Strenuous physical activity is known to generate reactive oxygen species to a point that can exceed the antioxidant defense system and lead to oxidative stress. Dietary intake of antioxidants, plasma enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase [Gr], and glutathione peroxidase [GPx]) activities, nonenzymatic (total antioxidant status [TAS], uric acid, alpha-tocopherol, retinol, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, and lutein + zeaxanthin) antioxidants, and markers of lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances [TBARS]) and muscle damage (creatine kinase [CK]) were measured in 17 elite male kayakers and canoeists under resting conditions and in an equal number of age- and sex-matched sedentary individuals. Athletes showed increased plasma values of alpha-tocopherol (p = .037), alpha-carotene (p = .003), beta-carotene (p = .007), and superoxide dismutase activity (p = .002) and a lower TAS level (p = .030). Antioxidant intake (alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, and beta-carotene) and plasmatic GPx, Gr, lycopene, lutein + zeaxanthin, retinol, and uric acid levels were similar in both groups. Nevertheless, TBARS (p < .001) and CK (p = .011) levels were found to be significantly higher in the kayakers and canoeists. This work suggests that despite the enhanced levels of antioxidants, athletes undergoing regular strenuous exercise exhibited more oxidative stress than sedentary controls."
0,"Carotenoids are a class of natural, fat-soluble pigments found principally in plants. They have potential antioxidant biological properties because of their chemical structure and interaction with biological membranes. Epidemiologic studies supported the hypothesis that antioxidants could be used as an inexpensive means of both primary and secondary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. In fact, the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in the vessels plays a key role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. The resistance of LDL to oxidation is increased by high dietary antioxidant intake, so that carotenoids, as part of food patterns such as the Mediterranean diet, may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health too. Further properties of carotenoids leading to a potential reduction of cardiovascular risk are represented by lowering of blood pressure, reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of inflammation (such as C-reactive protein), and improvement of insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver, and adipose tissues. In addition, recent nutrigenomics studies have focused on the exceptional ability of carotenoids in modulating the expression of specific genes involved in cell metabolism. The aim of this review is to focus attention to this effect of some carotenoids to prevent CVD. "
0,To review the literature and provide recommendations on diet and lifestyle considerations in patients with prostate cancer using evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with additional considerations based on observational evidence.
1,"We initiated our search on ClinicalTrials.gov combining the term ""prostate cancer"" with a variety of diet and lifestyle factors. We then supplemented our summary of publications from registered trials by including other publications available on Pubmed."
2,"There is a well-established benefit of exercise for improving functional outcomes and pelvic floor muscle training for improving treatment-related adverse effects. Multimodality interventions that integrate several factors (e.g., low-saturated fat, plant-based, whole-food diets with exercise, and stress reduction) appear to have the most clinically significant benefit for patients with prostate cancer. Ongoing multimodality interventions are including the efficacy of implementation strategies as observed outcomes. Limited RCT evidence suggests a clinically significant benefit for guided imagery/progressive muscle relaxation, Pilates, and lycopene-rich diets and a modest benefit for green tea, qigong, massage, and avoidance of nonprescribed vitamin and mineral supplements. Observational and single arm trial evidence indicates a need for further exploration of acupuncture, coffee, cruciferous vegetables, fish, Larrea tridentata, mushrooms, and vegetable-derived fats and avoidance of eggs, dairy, poultry with skin, processed red meat, and saturated fat. Published trials suggest no benefit from hypnosis, milk thistle, pomegranate, soy, or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation."
3,"Our search demonstrated that most diet and lifestyle factors identified from observational studies have limited data from RCTs. Few items have shown early evidence of benefit. The best recommendation for patients with prostate cancer is to form a habit of wellness through healthy eating, aerobic and resistance exercise, and psychological well-being. Future trial development should consider how interventions can be implemented into real world practice."
0,"Recent studies have suggested a protective role for lycopene, an antioxidant carotenoid, in the prevention of stress including environmental stress. Tomatoes and tomato products are the major dietary source of lycopene. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary tomato powder supplementation on the performance and lipid peroxidation of meat in Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) exposed to a high ambient temperature of 34 degrees C. A total of 180 ten-day-old male quails were randomly allocated into 6 groups consisting of 10 replicates of 3 birds. Birds were kept in wire cages in a temperature-controlled room at either 22 degrees C (thermoneutral) or 34 degrees C (heat stress) for 8 h/ d (0900 to 1700 h during the study). Birds were fed either a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 2.5 or 5.0% of tomato powder. Tomato powder supplementation linearly increased feed intake, live weight gain, and feed conversion (P = 0.01) under heat stress conditions but did not show the same effect at thermoneutral conditions (P > 0.05). Heat stress significantly increased malondialdehyde concentration and decreased vitamin concentrations in the serum, liver, and muscles of quail. Serum lycopene and vitamin C, E, and A (P = 0.01) concentrations increased linearly in birds at all groups. Malondialdehyde levels in serum, liver (P = 0.001), and muscles linearly decreased in all birds of both thermoneutral and heat stress groups as dietary tomato powder supplementation increased. The results of the study indicate that tomato powder modulates the oxidation-antioxidation system of the muscles in Japanese quail exposed to high ambient temperature."
0,"The aim of this study was to determine the tissue distribution of carotenoids in palm oil and to correlate the accumulation of carotenoids with protection against oxidative stress. We found that: (i) After 2 weeks beta-carotene in the liver increased from 7.3 to 30 ng/g wet tissue; alpha-carotene and lycopene after 10 weeks of feeding were 74 and 49 ng/g wet tissue respectively; (ii) Beta-carotene content in heart and hind limb skeletal muscles increased after 10 weeks to 17 and 6 ng/g wet tissue respectively; (iii) No carotenoids were detected in the brain, adipose and skin during the period of feeding; (iv) After in vitro induction of lipid peroxidation in liver homogenates by an azo-initiator of peroxyl radicals an inverse correlation between tissue carotenoid level and accumulation of lipid peroxidation products was observed; alpha-carotene > lycopene > beta-carotene."
0,"Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) have an important role in the development of liver fibrosis by producing extracellular matrix proteins when they are activated upon liver injury. We previously demonstrated that astaxanthin (ASTX), a xanthophyll carotenoid, attenuates HSC activation. The objective of this study was to compare the anti-fibrogenic effects of ASTX with those of other common carotenoids. LX-2 cells, a human HSC cell line, were treated with ASTX, lycopene, lutein (LT), zeaxanthin, or canthaxanthin, to measure messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of pro-fibrogenic genes. Pro-fibrogenic gene expressions were also measured in ASTX- or LT-treated primary mouse HSC. To determine the underlying mechanisms of the anti-fibrogenic effect of ASTX and LT, SMA-related and MAD-related protein 3 (SMAD3) pathways and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured in LX-2 cells. Among five carotenoids tested, ASTX and LT attenuated HSC activation in LX-2 cells by reducing the mRNA and protein levels of pro-fibrogenic genes, such as smooth muscle α actin and procollagen type I α1 (COL1A1). In addition, both ASTX and LT significantly decreased the expression of pro-fibrogenic genes, including COL1A1, COL3A1, and COL6A1, in activated primary mouse HSC, with ASTX being more potent than LT. The anti-fibrogenic effect of ASTX was mediated by inhibiting the phosphorylation of SMAD3 and cellular ROS accumulation, while LT only prevented the accumulation of ROS in LX-2 cells. In conclusion, ASTX showed the most potent anti-fibrogenic effect among the five carotenoids via inhibition of SMAD3 phosphorylation and cellular ROS accumulation while LT only prevented ROS levels in HSC."
0,"Quiescent, serum-starved human aortic smooth muscle cells were restimulated with 20% foetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, in the presence and absence of beta-carotene, canthaxanthin, zeaxanthin, lycopene, lutein or beta-cryptoxanthin, at final concentrations up to 23 microM. Concentration-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis, measured by [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation, was observed for the carotenoids, except for canthaxanthin and lutein which had no effect. Lycopene was the most potent of the carotenoids tested. The results suggest that antiproliferative effects of dietary carotenoids might be of significance in vivo."
0,"Carotenoids are important antioxidant compounds, present in many foods of plant, animal and marine origin. The aim of the present study was to describe the carotenoid composition of tomato waste, prawn muscle and cephalothorax and avian (duck and goose) egg yolks through the use of a modified gradient elution HPLC method with a C<sub>30</sub> reversed-phase column for the efficient separation and analysis of carotenoids and their <i>cis</i>-isomers. Elution time was reduced from 60 to 45 min without affecting the separation efficiency. All-<i>trans</i> lycopene predominated in tomato waste, followed by all-<i>trans</i>-β-carotene, 13-<i>cis</i>-lutein and all-<i>trans</i> lutein, while minor amounts of 9-<i>cis</i>-lutein, 13-<i>cis</i>-β-carotene and 9-<i>cis</i>-β-carotene were also detected. Considering the above findings, tomato waste is confirmed to be an excellent source of recovering carotenoids, especially all-<i>trans</i> lycopene, for commercial use. Xanthophylls were the major carotenoids of avian egg yolks, all-<i>trans</i> lutein and all-<i>trans</i> zeaxanthin in duck and goose egg yolk, respectively. In the <i>Penaeus kerathurus</i> prawn, several carotenoids (zeaxanthin, all-<i>trans</i>-lutein, canthaxanthin, cryptoxanthin, optical and geometrical astaxanthin isomers) were identified in considerable amounts by the same method. A major advantage of this HPLC method was the efficient separation of carotenoids and their <i>cis</i>-isomers, originating from a wide range of matrices."
0,"The complex network of etiological factors, signals and tissue responses involved in chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) cannot be successfully targeted by a single therapeutic agent. Multimodal approaches to the therapy of CP/CPPS have been and are currently being tested, as in the frame of complex diagnostic-therapeutic phenotypic approaches such as the urinary, psychosocial, organ-specific, infection, neurological and muscle tenderness (UPOINTS) system. In this study, the effect of combination therapy on 914 patients diagnosed, phenotyped and treated in a single specialized prostatitis clinic was analyzed. Patients received α-blockers, <i>Serenoa repens</i> (<i>S. repens</i>) extracts combined or not with supplements (lycopene and selenium) and, in the presence of documented or highly suspected infection, antibacterial agents. Combination treatment induced marked and significant improvements of National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) prostatitis symptom scores, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) sexual dysfunction scores, urinary peak flow rates and bladder voiding efficiency. These improvements, assessed after a 6-month course of therapy, were sustained throughout a follow-up period of 18 months. A clinically appreciable reduction of ≥6 points of the total NIH-CPSI score was achieved in 77.5% of patients subjected to combination therapy for a period of 6 months. When the patients were divided in two cohorts, depending on the diagnosis of CP/CPPS [inflammatory (IIIa) vs. non-inflammatory (IIIb) subtypes], significant improvements of all signs and symptoms of the syndrome were observed in both cohorts at the end of therapy. Intergroup comparison showed that patients affected by the IIIa sub-category of CP/CPPS showed more severe signs and symptoms (NIH-CPSI total, pain and quality of life impact scores, and Qmax) at baseline when compared with IIIb patients. However, the improvement of symptoms after therapy was significantly more pronounced in IIIa patients when compared with IIIb patients. In contrast to current opinion, the evidence emerging from the present investigation suggests that the inflammatory and non-inflammatory sub-categories of CP/CPPS may represent two distinct pathological conditions or, alternatively, two different stages of the same condition. In conclusion, a simple protocol based on α-blockers, <i>S. repens</i> extracts and supplements and antibacterial agents, targeting the urinary, organ specific and infection domains of UPOINTS, may induce a clinically appreciable improvement of the signs and symptoms of CP/CPPS in a considerable percentage of patients. In patients not responding sufficiently to such therapy, second-line agents (antidepressants, anxiolytics, muscle relaxants, 5-phosphodiesterase inhibitors and others) may be administered in order to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic response."
0,"The large volume of training performed by elite athletes throughout the season can translate into a chronic oxidative insult. To study the effects that chronically high training loads have on athletes' redox status, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and creatine kinase activities; total antioxidant status (TAS); and uric acid, retinol, alpha-tocopherol, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein + zeaxanthin, vitamin C, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), interleukin-6, and cortisol levels were determined in 9 kayakers (6 men) in a competitive period during the first season (June, T1), and in precompetitive (March, T2) and competitive (June, T3) periods during the following season. TAS decreased from the first to the second season (T1 vs. T2, p < 0.001; T1 vs. T3, p < 0.001). TBARS (p = 0.024) decreased from T1 to T2. The alpha-tocopherol increase (p = 0.001) from T1 to T2 lost statistical significance after adjustment for total lipids (p = 0.243). GPx (p = 0.003) increased, while SOD (p < 0.001) and uric acid (p = 0.032) decreased from T2 to T3. Cortisol levels decreased significantly throughout the study (T1 vs. T2, p = 0.042; T2 vs. T3, p = 0.018; T1 vs. T3, p = 0.002). No significant differences were observed for any of the other parameters studied. Antioxidant status changed more within the same season than from one season to another. Redox markers should be monitored throughout the season to detect athletes at an increased oxidative risk."
0,"Carotenoids are health-promoting organic molecules that act as antioxidants and essential nutrients. We show that chickens raised on a diet enriched with an engineered corn variety containing very high levels of four key carotenoids (β-carotene, lycopene, zeaxanthin and lutein) are healthy and accumulate more bioavailable carotenoids in peripheral tissues, muscle, skin and fat, and more retinol in the liver, than birds fed on standard corn diets (including commercial corn supplemented with colour additives). Birds were challenged with the protozoan parasite Eimeria tenella and those on the high-carotenoid diet grew normally, suffered only mild disease symptoms (diarrhoea, footpad dermatitis and digital ulcers) and had lower faecal oocyst counts than birds on the control diet. Our results demonstrate that carotenoid-rich corn maintains poultry health and increases the nutritional value of poultry products without the use of feed additives. "
0,"The sclerotia of Pleurotus tuberregium are used in Southern Nigeria for the management of diabetes and hypertension, yet there is scarcity of information in the literature regarding the evaluation of the biochemical basis of its antihypertensive property, as well as the biochemical impact of its administration to the hypertensive. Thus, in this study, the ability of an aqueous extract of the sclerotia of Pleurotus tuberregium to moderate biochemical and hematological indices was investigated in normal and sub-chronic salt-loaded rats."
1,"The normal and treatment control groups received a diet consisting 100% of the commercial feed, while the test control, reference and test treatment groups received an 8% salt-loaded diet. The extract was orally administered daily at 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight; while the moduretics was administered at 1 mg/kg. The normal and test control groups received appropriate volumes of water by the same route."
2,"On gas chromatographic analysis of the crude aqueous extract, 29 known flavonoids (mainly 47.71% kaempferol and 37.36% quercetin), four saponins (mainly 72.93% avenacin B1 and 26.80% avenacin A1), six hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (mainly 57.57% p-coumaric and 42.10% caffeic acid), ten carotenoids (mainly 58.44% carotene and 28.16% lycopene) and seven phytosterols (mainly 98.16% sitosterol) were detected. Also detected were nine benzoic acid derivatives (mainly 44.19% ferulic acid and 25.92% rosmarinic acid), six lignans (mainly 70.88% galgravin and 22.69% retusin), three allicins (mainly 71.92% diallyl thiosulphinate and 23.68% methyl allyl thiosulphinate), seven glycosides (mainly 84.86% arbutin and 12.01% ouabain), 31 alkaloids (mainly 48.82% lupanine, 32.26% augustamine) and 24 terpenes (mainly 60.66% limonene and 6.52% geranyl acetate). Compared to test control, the treatment significantly, dose-dependently lowered (P < 0.05) the mean cell volume, atherogenic indices (cardiac risk ratio, atherogenic coefficient and atherogenic index of plasma), plasma alanine and aspartate transaminase activities, mean cell hemoglobin, sodium, bicarbonate, urea, blood urea nitrogen, triglyceride, total-, non-high density lipoprotein-, low density lipoprotein- and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, and neutrophils, monocytes and platelets counts of the treated animals. However, it significantly, dose-dependently increased (P < 0.05) the hemoglobin concentration, mean cell hemoglobin, red cells and lymphocytes counts, plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol, calcium, potassium, chloride, creatinine, albumin and total protein concentrations of the treated animals."
3,"All these results support the use of the plant in traditional health care, for the management of hypertension, and highlight the cardio-protective potential of the sclerotia, whilst suggesting that its antihypertensive activity may be mediated through alteration of plasma levels of sodium and potassium, or increases in muscle tone brought about by changes in plasma calcium levels."
0,"This study aimed to investigate the response of blood antioxidants and biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, muscle damage and inflammation to a 1000m kayak trial in elite male kayakers."
1,"Enzymatic (superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione reductase [Gr] and glutathione peroxidase [GPx] activities) and non-enzymatic (total antioxidant status [TAS], uric acid, α-tocopherol, α-carotene, β-carotene, lycopene and lutein and zeaxanthin) antioxidants, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), creatine kinase (CK), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cortisol were determined in 15 elite male kayakers before and 15 min after a 1000-m kayak simulated race."
2,"Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were unaffected by exercise, with the exception of α-carotene which decreased (P=0.013). Uric acid levels were incremented following exercise (P=0.016). The acute exercise resulted in a significant decrease in TAS (P=0.001) and in an increase in CK (P=0.023), TBARS (P<0.001) and IL-6 (P=0.028)."
3,Our study suggests that a 1000-m kayak simulated race induces oxidative stress and damage in highly-trained kayakers.
0,"The progression and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are intimately associated with tobacco smoke/biomass fuel-induced oxidative and aldehyde/carbonyl stress. Alterations in redox signaling proinflammatory kinases and transcription factors, steroid resistance, unfolded protein response, mucus hypersecretion, extracellular matrix remodeling, autophagy/apoptosis, epigenetic changes, cellular senescence/aging, endothelial dysfunction, autoimmunity, and skeletal muscle dysfunction are some of the pathological hallmarks of COPD. In light of the above it would be prudent to target systemic and local oxidative stress with agents that can modulate the antioxidants/ redox system or by boosting the endogenous levels of antioxidants for the treatment and management of COPD. Identification of various antioxidant agents, such as thiol molecules (glutathione and mucolytic drugs, such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine, N-acystelyn, erdosteine, fudosteine, ergothioneine, and carbocysteine lysine salt), dietary natural product-derived polyphenols and other compounds (curcumin, resveratrol, green tea catechins, quercetin sulforaphane, lycopene, acai, alpha-lipoic acid, tocotrienols, and apocynin) have made it possible to modulate various biochemical aspects of COPD. Various researches and clinical trials have revealed that these antioxidants can detoxify free radicals and oxidants, control expression of redox and glutathione biosynthesis genes, chromatin remodeling, and ultimately inflammatory gene expression. In addition, modulation of cigarette smoke-induced oxidative stress and related cellular changes have also been reported to be effected by synthetic molecules. This includes specific spin traps like α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone, a catalytic antioxidant (ECSOD mimetic), porphyrins (AEOL 10150 and AEOL 10113), and a superoxide dismutase mimetic M40419, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation blockers/inhibitors, such as edaravone and lazaroids/tirilazad, myeloperoxidase inhibitors, as well as specialized pro-resolving mediators/inflammatory resolving lipid mediators, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and hydrogen sulfide. According to various studies it appears that the administration of multiple antioxidants could be a more effective mode used in the treatment of COPD. In this review, various pharmacological and dietary approaches to enhance lung antioxidant levels and beneficial effects of antioxidant therapeutics in treating or intervening the progression of COPD have been discussed."
0,"The carotenoid compositions, antioxidant activities and the potential cardio-protective role of 13 tomato cultivars with distinct colour were studied. Colour coordinates were evaluated by colorimeter and the carotenoid compositions were analysed by UPLC. Red tomatoes had the highest total carotenoid contents (TCC) and antioxidant activities, followed by purple, orange, pink and yellow ones. The TCC were 120.5-278.0 μg/gDW, and the antioxidant activities were 21.32-40.07 μmolTE/gDW (PCL), 64.42-89.98% (DPPH) and 10.47-13.76 μmolTE/g DW (ORAC), respectively. The lipophilic extracts were also found to prevent cell death in a cell-based model system using cardiac H9c2 cells and H(2)O(2), via attenuation of the caspase-3 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 activities. The extracts of different tomatoes showed strong but different antioxidant activities. Roles of total and individual carotenoids in the antioxidant activities were studied and lycopene showed the highest correlation. Results of this study can be used to guide the development of new tomato cultivars and functional foods, and benefit the consumers."
0,"Watermelon is rich in L-citrulline, an effective precursor of L-arginine. This study was conducted to determine whether dietary supplementation with watermelon pomace juice could ameliorate the metabolic syndrome in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, an animal model of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Nine-week-old ZDF rats were assigned randomly to receive drinking water containing 0% (control) or 0.2% L-arginine (as 0.24% L-arginine-HCl), 63% watermelon pomace juice, 0.01% lycopene, or 0.05% citrus pectin (n = 6 per treatment). At the end of the 4-wk supplementation period, blood samples, aortic rings, and hearts were obtained for biochemical and physiological analyses. Feed or energy intakes did not differ among the 5 groups of rats. However, dietary supplementation with watermelon pomace juice or L-arginine increased serum concentrations of arginine; reduced fat accretion; lowered serum concentrations of glucose, free fatty acids, homocysteine, and dimethylarginines; enhanced GTP cyclohydrolase-I activity and tetrahydrobiopterin concentrations in the heart; and improved acetylcholine-induced vascular relaxation. Compared with the control, dietary supplementation with lycopene or citrus pectin did not affect any measured parameter. These results provide the first evidence to our knowledge for a beneficial effect of watermelon pomace juice as a functional food for increasing arginine availability, reducing serum concentrations of cardiovascular risk factors, improving glycemic control, and ameliorating vascular dysfunction in obese animals with type-II diabetes."
0,"We used DNA microarrays to identify panels of transcriptional markers of aging that are differentially expressed in young (5 month) and old (25 month) mice of multiple inbred strains (129sv, BALB/c, CBA, DBA, B6, C3H and B6C3F(1)). In the heart, age-related changes of five genes were studied throughout the mouse lifespan: complement component 4, chemokine ligand 14, component of Sp100-rs, phenylalanine hydroxylase and src family associated phosphoprotein 2. A similar analysis in the brain (cerebellum) involved complement component 1q (alpha polypeptide), complement component 4, P lysozyme structural, glial fibrillary acidic protein and cathepsin S. Caloric restriction (CR) inhibited age-related expression of these genes in both tissues. Parametric analysis of gene set enrichment identified several biological processes that are induced with aging in multiple mouse strains. We also tested the ability of dietary antioxidants to oppose these transcriptional markers of aging. Lycopene, resveratrol, acetyl-l-carnitine and tempol were as effective as CR in the heart, and alpha-lipoic acid and coenzyme Q(10) were as effective as CR in the cerebellum. These findings suggest that transcriptional biomarkers of aging in mice can be used to estimate the efficacy of aging interventions on a tissue-specific basis."
0,"Dietary epidemiological studies indicate correlations between the consumption of red meat and/or processed meat and cancer of the colon, rectum, stomach, pancreas, bladder, endometrium and ovaries, prostate, breast and lung, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. The correlation of all these major diseases with dietary red meat indicates the presence of factors in red meat that damage biological components. This hypothesis will focus on the biochemistry of heme compounds and their oxidative processes. Raw red meat contains high levels of oxymyoglobin and deoxymyoglobin and oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and cytochromes in muscle and other tissues. Cooked and processed meat contain hemichromes and hemochromes. After being eaten heme proteins are hydrolyzed to amino acids and peptides and the heme group which is coordinated with strong ligands. The iron of heme coordinates to the sulfur, nitrogen or oxygen of amino acids and peptides and other biological components. The coordinated heme groups are absorbed and transported by the blood to every organ and tissue. Free and coordinated heme preferentially catalyze oxidative reactions. Heme catalyzed oxidations can damage lipids, proteins, DNA and other nucleic acids and various components of biological systems. Heme catalysis with hydroperoxide intermediates can initiate further oxidations some of which would result in oxidative chain reactions. Biochemical and tissue free radical damage caused by heme catalyzed oxidations is similar to that resulting from ionizing radiation. Oxidative biochemical damage is widespread in diseases. It is apparent that decreasing the amount of dietary red meat will limit the level of oxidative catalysts in the tissues of the body. Increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits elevates the levels of antioxidative components, for example, selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C, lycopene, cysteine-glutathione and various phytochemicals. These detrimental processes of heme catalysis of oxidative damage hypothesized here are not well recognized. More investigative studies in this field need to be done."
0,"Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) is a vegetable rich in antioxidants, such as lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin. Their presence is responsible for the characteristic ability of this product to inhibit the formation of reactive oxygen species, including singlet oxygen. The grapes and wines derived from grapes also contain powerful antioxidants. The antioxidant effect is derived from the polyphenols such as resveratrol and proanthocyanidin. Resveratrol is phytoalexin that is synthesized via the activation of the gene, stilbene synthase (STS). We decided to determine if the introduction of this gene into Lycopersicon esculentum Mill could modify its antioxidant activity. Using Electronic Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, which permits the detection of antiradical activity, especially *OH (hydroxyl radical), we showed that the antioxidant activity of the products, into which the gene STS had been introduced, was almost double than that of natural products and that their activity was especially pronounced due to ripening. Moreover, resveratrol concentrations in modified tomatoes were much higher than that found in the individual fruit. In the isolated hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, the rats fed with modified tomato exhibited better cardiac performance, reduced myocardial infarct size and decreased number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes, and reduced oxidative stress compared to unmodified tomato or resveratrol alone indicating superior cardioprotective abilities of modified tomatoes."
0,"The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is associated with life in aerobic conditions. ROS are thought to be implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases since they are capable of damaging biological macromolecules such as DNA, carbohydrates and proteins. The organism maintains defense against ROS, including enzymes and low molecular-weight antioxidants. An important source of antioxidants is diet which contains numerous compounds exhibiting antioxidant activity. A shortage of antioxidants in the diet might promote coronary heart disease through accumulation of oxidized LDL in macrophages. However, antioxidants may also influence endothelial functions, smooth muscle cell proliferation, thrombosis and plaque rupture. Consumption of fruits and vegetables, olive oil, red wine and tea is inversely correlated with heart disease rates. These foods are particularly rich in natural antioxidant nutrients, including ascorbate (vitamin C), the tocopherols (vitamin E) and carotenoids. More than 600 naturally occurring carotenoids have been identified. These compounds are plant pigments that provide the bright color of various fruits and vegetables; lycopene, which gives tomatoes their red color, is under active research. Flavonoids are > 4,000 naturally occurring substances which provide color, texture and taste for plant foods. As free radical scavengers, flavonoids inhibit lipid peroxidation, promote vascular relaxation and help prevent atherosclerosis. A sufficient supply with antioxidants from diet might help prevent or delay the occurrence of pathological changes associated with oxidative stress. When diet fails to meet the antioxidant requirement, dietary supplements might be indicated. The recently coined term nutriceuticals describes a variety of nonprescription products that are used to enhance health. The best known are vitamin E, vitamin C, carotenoids, coenzyme Q10, flavonoids and the amino acid L-arginine. Rigorous clinical trials, particularly among high-risk groups, are needed before they can be recommended routinely to patients."
0,"Oxidized LDL is highly atherogenic as it stimulates macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation, it is cytotoxic to cells of the arterial wall and it stimulates inflammatory and thrombotic processes. LDL oxidation can lead to its subsequent aggregation, which further increases cellular cholesterol accumulation. All major cells in the arterial wall including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and monocyte derived macrophages can oxidize LDL. Macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL is probably a hallmark in early atherosclerosis, and it depends on the oxidative state of the LDL and that of the macrophages. The LDL oxidative state is elevated by increased ratio of poly/mono unsaturated fatty acids, and it is reduced by elevation of LDL-associated antioxidants such as vitamin E, beta-carotene, lycopene, and polyphenolic flavonoids. The macrophage oxidative state depends on the balance between cellular NADPH-oxidase and the glutathione system. LDL-associated polyphenolic flavonoids which inhibit its oxidation, can also reduce macrophage oxidative state, and subsequently the cell-mediated oxidation of LDL. Oxidation of the macrophage lipids, which occurs under oxidative stress, can lead to cell-mediated oxidation of LDL even in the absence of transition metal ions, and may be operable in vivo. Finally, elimination of Ox-LDL from extracellular spaces, after it was formed under excessive oxidative stress, can possibly be achieved by the hydrolytic action of HDL-associated paraoxonase on lipoprotein's lipid peroxides. The present review article summarizes the above issues with an emphasis on our own data."
