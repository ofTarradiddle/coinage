## of Becoming

The essence of man is creation. We can only create, the object of which is all that changes. 

In procreation, for the species we call homo sapiens, of which we call Man, of which we are, of which we have a limited conception of, to create an additional life requires the consolidation of multiple lives. Make one from two. 

Within this concept of existence is another. 

Man is built of consciousness. In ego, a natural lense to view reality from, we perceive ourself as a single consciousness, and this may be accurate. Yet, at each level of consciousness is as well, a single consciousness. We are built of what seems to be an infinite level of consciousnesses. Each level higher sees an aggregate view of reality in such a way that individuality arises. When we see the world we do not say our left eye sees the left view, and the right of the right eye. Instead we see as one. When our hands reach to make contact with an object, we do not feel as though each is of itself, in contrast, we feel as though each is of us. The thought that we are the ultimate of creation is thus truly an illusion. For we do not think to beat our heart, yet it beats. We do not think to fend of sickness with our immune system, nor do we think of digesting our food. What we do is to make sure that we have our necessities in place. Where necessity itself is abstract, and continues to change. We have certain responsibilities with the level of consciousness that we have. Each cell within us is just as full of life as a Man, yet their reality is completely different in that their requirements must fulfill a different set. We say that life began with single celled organisms. So to science, we must at least believe that up to the granularity of a single cell, they have their own consciousness, and their own reality that works in unison with our existence. Would it be strange at all to then conceive of life at the level beyond Man?
