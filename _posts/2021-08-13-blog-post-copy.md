Welcome to of Nectar's of Coin. 

We do Research into asset pricing using novel statistical methods. 

We utilize a variety of data sources in our research so as to provide alpha signals, and timing factors, conditional on as many independent sources of information as our research can find. 

Our current objectives are building out our suite of fundamental, text, and price level databases, as well as our proprietary alpha models on top of these. 

If you have questoins about collaborating with us feel free to email us.
