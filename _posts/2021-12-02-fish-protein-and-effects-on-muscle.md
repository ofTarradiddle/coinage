"In our previous study, fish protein was proven to reduce serum lipids and body fat accumulation by skeletal muscle hypertrophy and enhancing basal energy expenditure in rats. In the present study, we examined the precise effects of fish protein intake on different skeletal muscle fiber types and metabolic gene expression of the muscle. Fish protein increased fast-twitch muscle weight, reduced liver triglycerides and serum glucose levels, compared with the casein diet after 6 or 8 weeks of feeding. Furthermore, fish protein upregulated the gene expressions of a fast-twitch muscle-type marker and a glucose transporter in the muscle. These results suggest that fish protein induces fast-muscle hypertrophy, and the enhancement of basal energy expenditure by muscle hypertrophy and the increase in muscle glucose uptake reduced liver lipids and serum glucose levels. The present results also imply that fish protein intake causes a slow-to-fast shift in muscle fiber type. "
0,"The aminoacidemia resulting from food protein digestion in response to exercise plays an underlying role in the rate of muscle protein synthesis. Whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) has been demonstrated to cause more pronounced postexercise aminoacidemia compared with casein and soy. Although fish protein has been demonstrated to be a great source of amino acids, there is no data available providing information about the postexercise aminoacidemia after fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) intake. The present study investigated the characteristic patterns of postexercise aminoacidemia after WPH and FPH intake in nine physically active subjects (six males and three females). In a crossover, double-blind, and randomized design, all participants received oral doses of either 0.25 g/kg of FPH or WPH or placebo (PLA) immediately after a resistance exercise bout. Blood samples were taken before and at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after supplementation. There was a significant increase in plasma total amino acids (TAA), essential amino acids (EAA), branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and leucine concentrations at 30 and 60 min after FPH supplementation, and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after WPH as compared to PLA. No significant differences were observed in plasma TAA, EAA, BCAA, and leucine concentrations between FPH and WPH at any time point, and there were no significant difference observed in the area under the curve for TAA, EAA, BCAA, and leucine between FPH and WPH. In conclusion, both FPH and WPH showed a rapid and pronounced postexercise aminoacidemia. FPH presented itself to be an alternative food source of rapidly digested proteins to be used after resistance exercise. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) demonstrated a rapid and pronounced postexercise aminoacidemia. Whey protein hydrolysate showed similar effects. FPH is presented as an alternative food source of rapidly digested proteins to be consumed by the population, especially physically active individuals."
0,"Assessments of both neural and muscular adaptations during interventions would provide valuable information for developing countermeasures to age-related muscle dysfunctions. We investigated the effect of fish protein ingestion on training-induced neural and muscular adaptations in older adults. Twenty older adults participated 8 weeks of isometric knee extension training intervention. The participants were divided into two groups who took fish protein (n = 10, Alaska pollack protein, APP) or casein (n = 10, CAS). Maximal muscle strength during knee extension, lower extremity muscle mass (body impedance method), and motor unit firing pattern of knee extensor muscle (high-density surface electromyography) were measured before, during, and after the intervention. Muscle strength were significantly increased in both CAS (124.7 ± 5.8%) and APP (117.1 ± 4.4%) after intervention (p < .05), but no significant differences between the groups were observed (p > .05). Significant increases in lower extremity muscle mass from 0 to 8 weeks were demonstrated only for APP (102.0 ± 3.2, p < .05). Greater changes in motor unit firing pattern following intervention were represented in CAS more than in APP. These results suggest that nutritional supplementations could modulate neural and muscular adaptations following resistance training and fish protein ingestion preferentially induces muscular adaptation without the detectable neural adaptation in older adults."
0,"The generation of biologically active fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) is a useful technique to produce value-added products with potential application in the functional food and nutraceutical industries. Fish muscle is an attractive substrate for the production of protein hydrolysates due to its rich protein content, containing 15-25% of total fish protein. This paper reviews the production of protein hydrolysates from fish muscle, most commonly via enzymatic hydrolysis, and their subsequent bioactivities including anti-obesity, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory, anti-microbial, and anti-cancer activities as measured by in vitro testing methods. Disease prevention with FPH potentially offers a safe and natural alternative to synthetic drugs. Small molecular weight (MW) FPHs generally exhibit favourable bioactivity than large MW fractions via enhanced absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. This review also discusses the relationship between amino acid (AA) composition and AA sequence of FPH and peptides and their exhibited in vitro bioactivity."
0,"Alaska pollack protein (APP) was previously shown to reduce serum triacylglycerol and the atherogenic index and significantly increase gastrocnemius muscle mass in rats. To determine which myofibers are involved in this observed hypertrophy, we stained the gastrocnemius muscle with fast and slow fiber-specific antibodies and measured the muscle fiber diameter. We observed muscle hypertrophy in both the fast and slow fibers of APP-fed rats. Although muscle hypertrophy leads to drastic lipid changes, the amount of lipids did not differ significantly between casein-fed and APP-fed rats. To determine the lipid changes at the molecular species level and their localization, we performed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging to visualize lipids in the gastrocnemius muscles. We determined that lipid molecules were significantly changed due to APP feeding. Thus, APP feeding changes muscle lipid metabolism, and these metabolic changes might be related to hypertrophy."
0,"The interactions between liposomes and fish myofibrillar protein (surimi ground salted protein, SURP) were evaluated. Liposomes prepared with ultrapure phosphatidylcholine (UPC) or partially purified phosphatidylcholine (PPC) were dispersed at different weight ratio on SURP. Changes in protein stability and structure were evaluated using FTIR, intrinsic fluorescence and free sulfhydryl groups, and changes in liposome properties were studied by dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. PPC promoted denaturation and aggregation of SURP, reflected in secondary structure loss, exposure of tyrosine residues and increment of free sulfhydryl. UPC produced partial unfolding and changes in the secondary structure of SURP from α-helical to β-strand. Liposome size increased by about 40% and showed modified surface charge after SURP exposure, indicating the formation of protein corona. Surface charge and composition of liposomes influence SURP stability and could exert different effects on the myofibrillar protein network, which is important for liposome applications in surimi products."
0,"Fish-derived proteins, particularly fish protein hydrolysates (FPH), offer potential as high-quality sources of dietary protein, whilst enhancing economic and environmental sustainability. This study investigated the impact of a blue whiting-derived protein hydrolysate (BWPH) on aminoacidaemia in vivo and skeletal muscle anabolism in vitro compared with whey protein isolate (WPI) and an isonitrogenous, non-essential amino acid (NEAA) control (0.33 g·kg<sup>-1</sup>·body mass<sup>-1</sup>) in an ex vivo, in vitro experimental design. Blood was obtained from seven healthy older adults (two males, five females; age: 72 ± 5 years, body mass index: 24.9 ± 1.6 kg·m<sup>2</sup>) in three separate trials in a randomised, counterbalanced, double-blind design. C2C12 myotubes were treated with ex vivo human serum-conditioned media (20%) for 4 h. Anabolic signalling (phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1) and puromycin incorporation were determined by immunoblotting. Although BWPH and WPI both induced postprandial essential aminoacidaemia in older adults above the NEAA control, peak and area under the curve (AUC) leucine and essential amino acids were more pronounced following WPI ingestion. Insulin was elevated above baseline in WPI and BWPH only, a finding reinforced by higher peak and AUC values compared with NEAA. Muscle protein synthesis, as measured by puromycin incorporation, was greater after incubation with WPI-fed serum compared with fasted serum (<i>P</i> = 0.042), and delta change was greater in WPI (<i>P</i> = 0.028) and BWPH (<i>P</i> = 0.030) compared with NEAA. Myotube hypertrophy was greater in WPI and BWPH compared with NEAA (both <i>P</i> = 0.045), but was similar between bioactive conditions (<i>P</i> = 0.853). Taken together, these preliminary findings demonstrate the anabolic potential of BWPH in vivo and ex vivo, thus providing justification for larger studies in older adults using gold-standard measures of acute and chronic MPS in vivo."
0,"Fish protein is a source of animal protein that is consumed worldwide. Although it has been reported that the intake of Alaska pollack protein (APP) reduces body fat accumulation and increases muscle weight in rats, the mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. As a possibility, peptides released from APP in the gastrointestinal tract are important to the functions of APP. In the present study, we examined the effects of APP hydrolysate digested artificially with pepsin and pancreatin on white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. We found that APP hydrolysate group shows significantly lower weight of white adipose tissue and higher weight of soleus muscle than the control group. We also found that APP hydrolysate group reduces food intake and mRNA expressions of neuropeptide Y and agouti-related protein in the hypothalamus compared with the control group. These results may imply that APP hydrolysate exhibits anti-obesity activity by the reduction of appetite and the enhancement of basal energy expenditure by skeletal muscle hypertrophy in rats. The downregulation of orexigenic gene by APP hydrolysate in the hypothalamus may contribute to the reduction of appetite. These results suggest that the effect of APP on anti-obesity and muscle hypertrophy may be induced by peptides released from APP in the gastrointestinal tract."
0,"Age-related loss of muscle mass and function is common in older adults, and studies investigating if dietary proteins may protect and possibly build lean body mass are needed. We assessed the feasibility of conducting a nutritional intervention study in older nursing home residents to investigate the effects of fish protein supplementation on markers of glucose metabolism and inflammation."
1,"This was a double-blind randomised controlled pilot study. Twenty-four nursing home residents, without major cognitive impairment, received a daily oral nutritional supplement containing 5.2 g of fish protein or placebo for 6 weeks. Anthropometric measurements were conducted at baseline. Participants were screened for nutritional risk using the Mini Nutritional Assessment and activities of daily living using the Barthel index and dietary intake was registered. Hand grip strength was measured and fasting blood samples collected at baseline and endpoint."
2,"Compliance was high and dropout was low, but participant recruitment was challenging. Serum concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 decreased, and C-reactive protein increased in the intervention group compared to control, with no changes in markers of glucose metabolism between groups."
3,Conducting a nutritional intervention using fish protein supplementation in older nursing home residents is feasible but should be conducted as a multi-centre study to account for the low recruitment rate observed in the present study. A full-scale study is needed to gain more knowledge on the potential effects of fish proteins on markers of glucose metabolism and inflammation in relation to the age-related loss of muscle mass and function.

0,"The popularity of high-protein diets for weight reduction is immense. However, the potential benefits from altering the source of dietary protein rather than the amount is scarcely investigated. In the present study, we examined the effects of fish protein supplement on glucose and lipid metabolism in overweight adults. A total of thirty-four overweight adults were randomised to 8 weeks' supplementation with fish protein or placebo tablets (controls). The intake of fish protein supplement was 3 g/d for the first 4 weeks and 6 g/d for the last 4 weeks. In this study, 8 weeks of fish protein supplementation resulted in lower values of fasting glucose (P< 0·05), 2 h postprandial glucose (P< 0·05) and glucose-area under the curve (AUC) (five measurements over 2 h, P< 0·05) after fish protein supplementation compared to controls. Glucose-AUC was decreased after 8 weeks with fish protein supplement compared to baseline (P< 0·05), concomitant with increased 30 min and decreased 90 min and 2 h insulin C-peptide level (P< 0·05), and reduced LDL-cholesterol (P< 0·05). Body muscle % was increased (P< 0·05) and body fat % was reduced (P< 0·05) after 4 weeks' supplementation. Physical activity and energy and macronutrients intake did not change during the course of the study. In conclusion, short-term daily supplementation with a low dose of fish protein may have beneficial effects on blood levels of glucose and LDL-cholesterol as well as glucose tolerance and body composition in overweight adults. The long-term effects of fish protein supplementation is of interest in the context of using more fish as a protein source in the diet, and the effects of inclusion of fish in the diet of individuals with low glucose tolerance should be evaluated."
0,"Fish protein represents one of the most widely consumed dietary protein sources by humans. The processing of material from the fishing industry generates substantial unexploited waste products, many of which possess high biological value. Protein hydrolysates, such as fish protein hydrolysates (FPH), containing predominantly di- and tripeptides, are more readily absorbed than free amino acids and intact protein. Furthermore, in animal models, FPH have been shown to possess numerous beneficial properties for cardiovascular, neurological, intestinal, renal, and immune health. Ageing is associated with the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, as well as increased oxidative stress, compromised vascularisation, neurological derangements, and immunosenescence. Thus, there appears to be a potential application for FPH in older persons as a high-quality protein source that may also confer additional health benefits. Despite this, there remains a dearth of information concerning the impact of FPH on health outcomes in humans. The limited evidence from human interventional trials suggests that FPH may hold promise for supporting optimal body composition and maintaining gut integrity. FPH also provide a high-quality source of dietary protein without negatively impacting on subjective appetite perceptions or regulatory hormones. Further studies are needed to assess the impact and utility of FPH on skeletal muscle health in older persons, ideally comparing FPH to 'established' protein sources or a non-bioactive, nitrogen-matched control. In particular, the effects of acute and chronic FPH consumption on post-exercise aminoacidaemia, skeletal muscle protein synthesis, and intramyocellular anabolic signalling in older adults are worthy of investigation. FPH may represent beneficial and sustainable alternative sources of high-quality protein to support skeletal muscle health and anabolism in ageing, without compromising appetite and subsequent energy intake."
0,"Dietary habits and lifestyle-related diseases indicate that food has a direct impact on individual health. Hence, a diet containing essential nutrients is important for healthy living. Fish and fish products are important in diets worldwide because of their nutritional value, especially their easily digestible proteins with essential amino acids. Similarly, fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) obtained from fish muscle and by-products has been reported to exhibit various biological activities and to have functional properties, which make FPH a suitable nutraceutical candidate. This review focuses on the health-promoting ability of FPH in terms of skin health, bone and cartilage health, blood lipid profile, and body-weight management studied in rats and human model systems. The absorption and bioavailability of FPH in humans is discussed, and challenges and obstacles of FPH as a functional food ingredient are outlined."
0,"Dietary fish oil (DFO) has been identified as a micronutrient supplement with the potential to improve musculoskeletal health in old age. Few data are available for effects of DFO on muscle contractility, despite the significant negative impact of muscle weakness on age-related health outcomes. Accordingly, the effects of a DFO intervention on the contractile function and proteomic profile of adult and aged in an animal model of aging were investigated."
1,"This preliminary study evaluated 14 adult (8 months) and 12 aged (22 months) male, Sprague-Dawley rats consuming a DFO-supplemented diet or a control diet for 8 weeks (7 adult and 6 aged/dietary group). Animal weight, food intake and grip strength were assessed at the start and end of the FO intervention. In situ force and contractile properties were measured in the medial gastrocnemius muscle following the intervention and muscles were processed for 2-D gel electrophoresis and proteomic analysis via liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by immunoblotting. Effects of age, diet and age x diet interaction were evaluated by 2-way ANOVA."
2,"A significant (P = 0.022) main effect for DFO to increase (~ 15%) muscle contractile force was observed, without changes in muscle mass. Proteomic analysis revealed a small number of proteins that differed across age and dietary groups at least 2-fold, most of which related to metabolism and oxidative stress. In seven of these proteins (creatine kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, pyruvate kinase, parvalbumin, beta-enolase, NADH dehydrogenase and Parkin7/DJ1), immunoblotting corroborated these findings. Parvalbumin showed only an effect of diet (increased with DFO) (P = 0.003). Significant age x diet interactions were observed in the other proteins, generally demonstrating increased expression in adult and decreased expression aged rats consuming DFO (all P > 0.011). However, correlational analyses revealed no significant associations between contractile parameters and protein abundances."
3,"Results of this preliminary study support the hypothesis that DFO can enhance musculoskeletal health in adult and aged muscles, given the observed improvement in contractile function. The fish oil supplement also alters protein expression in an age-specific manner, but the relationship between proteomic and contractile responses remains unclear. Further investigation to better understand the magnitude and mechanisms muscular effects of DFO in aged populations is warranted."
0,"This study investigated the therapeutic potential of undigested goby fish (Zosterisessor ophiocephalus) muscle proteins (UGP) and their hydrolysates on high-fat-high-fructose diet (HFFD)-fed rats. HFFD induced hyperglycemia, manifested by a significant increase in the levels of glucose and glycogen as well as α-amylase activity when compared to normal rats. The administration of GPHs to HFFD-fed rats significantly decreased α-amylase activity and the contents of blood glucose and hepatic glycogen. By contrast, the UGP increased the glucose metabolic disorders in HFFD-fed rats. Furthermore, HFFD-fed rats showed oxidative stress, as evidenced by decreased antioxidant enzyme activities and glutathione (GSH) levels and increased concentration of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde in liver and kidney. Interestingly, the daily gavage of UGP and GPHs improved the redox status in liver and kidney of HFFD-rats by ameliorating or reversing the above-mentioned changes. Moreover, GPHs exhibited a renal protective role by reversing the HFFD-induced decease of uric acid and increase of creatinine levels in serum and preventing some HFFD-induced changes in kidney architecture. The results demonstrate that GPHs contain bioactive peptides that possess significant hypoglycemic and antioxidant properties, and ameliorate renal damage in rats fed hypercaloric diet. "
0,"Materials coated with aqueous fish protein extracts can reduce bacterial adhesion, but the mechanism behind the observed effect is not fully understood. In this study we explore the physicochemical properties of fish muscle protein adlayers on four substrates: gold, stainless steel, polystyrene and silicon dioxide. The aims were (i) to determine if the anti-adhesive effect is independent of the underlying substrate chemistry, (ii) to link the physicochemical properties of the adlayer to its ability to repel bacteria, and (iii) to elucidate the mechanism behind this effect. The main proteins on all surfaces were the muscle proteins troponin, tropomyosin, and myosin, and the lipid binding protein apolipoprotein. The quantity, viscoelasticity, and hydration of the protein adlayers varied greatly on the different substrates, but this variation did not affect the bacterial repelling properties. Our results imply that these proteins adsorb to all substrates and provide a steric barrier towards bacterial adhesion, potentially providing a universal antifouling solution."
0,Many fishes have been known for their good nutritional effects especially in the cardiovascular aspect. Some specific fish peptides have anti-hypertensive effects.
1,"In the present study, we hypothesized that the hexapeptide (MEVFVP) from flounder fish muscle can be a potent antihypertensive peptide, therefore, decided to perform this experiment."
2,"The peptide MEVFVP from flounder fish muscle (40 mg/kg) and vehicle were administered per os to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) (SHR-M and SHR-C, respectively). Additionally, plasma MEVFVP was measured serially before and after its oral administration to Sprague Dawley rats."
3,"Blood pressures (BPs), especially systolic BP, in SHR rats were decreased around 3-6 hours after MEVFVP administration. Compared with SHR-C rats, endothelin-1 (ET-1) mRNA expression in multiple tissues, and plasma levels of ET-1, angiotensin II, and aldosterone were lower in SHR-M rats, whereas the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was increased in the kidney of SHR-M rats. The administered peptide was not detected in rat plasma, while ex vivo incubation of the peptide in rat plasma caused its rapid degradation within minutes."
4,"Our results show that the MEVFVP has an antihypertensive effect by regulating renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, ET-1 and AMPK despite its limited bioavailability."
0,"The emulsifying and antioxidant properties of fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) for the physical and oxidative stabilization of 5% (by weight) fish oil-in-water emulsions were investigated. Muscle proteins from sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) were hydrolyzed to degrees of hydrolysis (DH) of 3-4-5-6% with subtilisin. Sardine hydrolysates with low DH, 3% and 4%, presented the most effective peptides to physically stabilize emulsions with smaller droplet size. This implied more protein adsorbed at the interface to act as physical barrier against prooxidants. This fact might also be responsible for the higher oxidative stability of these emulsions, as shown by their lowest peroxide value and concentration of volatiles such as 1-penten-3-one and 1-penten-3-ol. Among the hydrolysates prepared from small-spotted catshark only the hydrolysate with DH 3% yielded a physically stable emulsion with low concentration of unsaturated aldehydes. These results show the potential of FPH as alternative protein emulsifiers for the production of oxidatively stable fish oil-in-water emulsions. "
0,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of lysine supplement on the growth performance of blunt snout bream Megalobrama amblycephala fed diets with fish meal (FM) replaced by rice protein concentrate (RPC) with the potential mechanisms characterized. Fish were fed three diets, including the FM diet (containing FM), the RPC diet (FM replaced by RPC), and the MRPC diet (the RPC diet supplemented with lysine) for 8 weeks. Weight gain, protein efficiency ratio, and nitrogen and energy utilization of fish fed the FM diet were all significantly higher than those of the RPC treatment, but they showed no statistical difference with those of the MRPC group. Fish fed the RPC diet showed shorter villi length of the distal intestine than that of the other treatments. No significance was found in whole-body composition and intestinal and hepatic cell proliferation among all the treatments. However, fish fed the RPC diet obtained relatively low transcriptions of growth hormone (GH), GH receptor, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), target of rapamycin (TOR), ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1, myoblast determination protein, myogenic factor 5, and myostatin a (MSTNa) but high levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2) than those of the other groups. Furthermore, little difference was found in the transcriptions of 4E-BP2, myogenin, muscle-specific regulatory 4, and MSTNb in muscle. Overall, these results showed that dietary supplement of lysine benefits the growth performance of blunt snout bream fed FM-free diets through the mediation of the GH-IGF-I axis, TOR signaling pathway, myogenic regulatory factors, and MSTN."
0,"Esterase activity found in muscle extracts is useful to evaluate harmful effects of anticholinesterase pollutants. Yet, most procedures applied in the extraction of fish muscle esterases in order to investigate their activity as a biomarker of environmental exposure comprise the homogenization of muscle tissue in low-salt solutions, followed by centrifugation to separate the supernatant as the enzyme source. However, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the main target in these monitoring efforts, is a membrane-bound protein and is only present in muscle extracts if homogenization is carried out using chaotropic high-salt solutions. In this context, four extraction procedures using muscle tissue from six fish species were evaluated in order to establish a reproducible and reliable AChE assay for the determination of this biomarker. Results indicate that over 80% of AChE activity might be lacking in low-salt supernatants, and that the highest activities are obtained after extraction with solutions containing either 1molL<sup>-1</sup> NaCl or 1molL<sup>-1</sup> NaCl plus 3% Triton X-100, preserving almost 100% esterase activity over acetylthiocholine as substrate after centrifugation. Thus, many studies in the literature suffer from theoretical flaws and report erroneous AChE activity, since typical muscle AChE activity, the end-point biomarker for anticholinesterase pollutants, may have not been consistently assayed."
0,"Muscle protein was one of critical accumulation protein for anthropogenic chemicals. However, few predictive models were constructed for muscle protein up to now. In addition, some ionizable chemicals classes e.g. sulfonates were not successfully modeled in previously models, indicating considerable work would be needed. The major objective of this study was to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the muscle protein-water partition coefficient (logK<sub>MP/w</sub>) of chicken and fish. In the modeling, the n-octanol/water distribution coefficient (logD), functional groups, atom-centred fragments and chemical form adjusted descriptors were used to construct the models. The application domain of the derived models was defined by the Euclidean distance-based method and Williams plot. The modeling results indicated that the determination coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>), leave-one out cross validation Q<sup>2</sup> (Q<sup>2</sup><sub>LOO</sub>) and bootstrapping coefficient (Q<sup>2</sup><sub>BOOT</sub>) of the QSAR models for chicken and fish were 0.882 and 0.929, 0.844 and 0.906, 0.779 and 0.792, respectively, implying the models had good goodness-of-fit and robustness. The coefficient determination (R<sup>2</sup><sub>EXT</sub>) and external validation coefficient (Q<sup>2</sup><sub>EXT</sub>) of the validation set for the two models were 0.874 and 0.937, 0.869 and 0.915, respectively, indicating the models had good predictive ability. The predictor variables selected to construct the logK<sub>MP/w</sub> models of chicken and fish included logD, the function groups, and the fraction of the ionized species (δ<sub>I</sub>). Considering the molecular descriptors used here can be calculated from their molecular structures directly, the developed models could be easily used to fill the logK<sub>MP/w</sub> data gap for other chemicals within the applicability domain."
0,"This study was designed to investigate proteome changes in Japanese puffer fish (Takifugu rubripes) during short- and long-term frozen storage. In total, 1484 proteins were quantified, and 164 proteins were identified as differential abundance proteins (DAPs) in Japanese puffer fish from two frozen storage treatment groups (14 days and 60 days) compared with the fresh control group. Correlation analysis between the DAPs and quality traits of the puffer fish muscle showed that 106 proteins were correlated closely with colour and texture (hardness, elasticity, and chewiness). Bioinformatics analysis revealed and Western blot analysis verified that Putative prothymosin alpha species, Bridging integrator 3, NADH: the ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit and Mx species are candidate biomarkers for puffer fish properties. This study offers valuable evidence to improve the quality control and monitoring of Japanese puffer fish during transportation and storage."
0,"Plant proteins are suitable and alternative to fish meals (FMs), with less cost compared with that of all other types of fish feeds. In recent years, soy protein concentrate (SPC) has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to FM; however, little is known regarding the effects of dietary SPC on general fish physiology and well-being. This study aimed to perform comprehensive physiological and transcriptomic analysis for testing the applicability of SPC as fish feeds in hybrid grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus♀ × E. lanceolatus♂) [SPC replaced 0% (CK), 30% (SPC30), and 75% (SPC75) of FM protein]. Generally, SPC30 promoted fish survival and had less effects on the phenotype, while SPC75 reduced fish survival, promoted inflammation, and regulated multiple physiological responses. Thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by SPC were identified in the intestine, liver, and muscle, which were enriched in biological regulation, cellular process, metabolic process, single-organism process, cell, cell part, membrane, binding, and catalytic activity based on RNA-seq. Notably, some DEGs involved in amino acid and lipid metabolism in the digestive system highlighted the modulatory effect of SPC on these metabolic processes, consistent with the physiological responses including enzyme activities. The enriched aspects of these predominant DEGs might be directly related to the different effects of SPC30 and SPC75 on fish growth, digestibility, and underlying enzyme activities and histology. In conclusion, the comprehensive physiological and transcriptomic comparative analysis of CK, SPC30, and SPC75 was also effective in testing the applicability of SPC as fish feeds and in designing a proper diet with the best impact on the growth performance and health of fish in hybrid grouper."
0,"Intermuscular bones in fish negatively influence both meet processing and attractiveness to consumers. Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) are both major farmed fish species globally, but whereas the former does not possess intermuscular bones, the latter does. Therefore, these two species might present a good model to study the genetic control of distribution of intermuscular bones in fish. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) gene is associated with tissue ossification and bone regeneration in mammals, but in fish its role in ossification remains understudied. To study the relationship between BMP4 and bone distribution in fish, we determined the expression of BMP4 in muscle tissues of common carp and tilapia on transcriptional and translational levels. As the gene has been merely predicted in silico from the genome of common carp, we have cloned and characterized it. The gene (GenBank: HQ446455) contains one intron and two exons, which encode a 400-amino acid protein with high homology to other known BMP4 protein sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that common carp clustered within the Cypriniformes clade (zebrafish was the closest ortholog) and tilapia within the Percomorpha clade. Using microCT scanning, we confirmed that intermuscular bones could be observed only in common carp (none in tilapia), but only in dorsal and caudal muscles (none in the ventral muscle). Expression levels of BMP4 in the muscles of common carp were in agreement with this observation both on transcriptional (qPCR) and translational (immunohistochemistry) level: higher in dorsal and caudal muscles, and lower in the ventral muscle. In tilapia, expression of BMP4 gene was also detectable in all three muscles, but expression levels in all three muscles were comparable to the one observed in the ventral muscle of carp, i.e., very low. Therefore, among the six studied muscles, the expression of BMP4 was high only in the two that possess intermuscular bones: dorsal and caudal muscles of common carp. The results of this study suggest that BMP4 is likely to play a key role in the determination of intermuscular bone distribution in fish in a dose-dependent manner."
0,"Fish mortality generally occurs during extreme summer temperatures in India which are apprehended to be more frequent in near future and may reduce the fish population, particularly in closed aquatic systems. This present study is conducted with the objectives to find out heat shock and associated oxidative stress responses that occurred in selected fish Labeo rohita due to extremely high water temperature (treated, 37-38 °C against control, 28-30 °C) exposure for 2 weeks. Calculated mortality was 30% during the experimental period. The results revealed the biomolecules associated with both the anti-oxidative response (reduced glutathione in serum, liver, muscle; catalase activity in liver, muscle; superoxide dismutase gene expression in the liver) and the heat shock response (hsp70 gene expression in the liver) were elevated under thermal stress. Pro-inflammatory responses (expression of complement protein 3, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the liver) and oxidative damages (lipid peroxidation in all studied tissue and DNA fragmentation in the liver) were more under thermal stress. Extreme thermal stress induced by partial lethal temperature exposure in this study led to the activation of both the heat shock response and the anti-oxidative response. However, these responses were not elicited to the level so that they can protect from oxidative damages and inflammation in the liver of all the studied fish that caused partial mortality in fish. Thermal stress-induced hepatotoxicity caused fish death which was documented for the first time in freshwater fish."
0,"On a day in November, the body of a 31-year-old man was found near a swimming lake with two open and partly emptied fish tins lying next to him. Further investigations showed that the man had been allergic to fish protein and suffered from severe depression and drug psychosis. Already some days before the suicide, he had repeatedly asked for fish to kill himself. Although the results of the chemical and toxicological examinations were negative, the autopsy findings and histological tests suggest that death was caused by an anaphylactic reaction."

enzymes and the metabolic and signaling processes regulated by these enzymes at certain stages of growth and
development of salmonid fishes are analyzed in the present review. The major pathways of intracellular proteolysis
relying on autophagy, proteasome activity, and calpain activity are considered, as well as the relative
contribution of these pathways to proteolysis in skeletal muscle of the fish. Skeletal muscle accounts for more
than half of the weight of the fish and undergoes the most significant changes due to the action of anabolic
and catabolic signals. Special attention is paid to the intensity of protein degradation during the active growth
period characterized by a high rate of protein synthesis and metabolism in fish, as well as to protein degradation
during the reproductive period characterized by predomination of catabolic processes in contrast to the
growth period. Skeletal muscle plays a unique role as a source of plastic and energy substrates in fish, and,
therefore, the process of muscle protein degradation is regarded as a key mechanism for the regulation of
growth intensity in juvenile salmon and for maintenance of viability and reproductive capacity of salmonid
fish during the maturation of gametes, starvation, and migration related to spawning. The possibility of using
a set of parameters of intracellular proteolysis to characterize the early development of salmonids is demonstrated
in the review."
0,"We investigated the effect of endogenous cathepsin L on surimi gel produced from olive flounder (<i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i>). The amino acid sequences of six proteins predicted or identified as cathepsin L were obtained from the olive flounder genome database, and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted. Next, cathepsin L activity toward <i>N</i>-α-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-arginine-(7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) (Z-F-R-AMC) was detected in crude olive flounder extract and a crude enzyme preparation. A considerable decrease in the level of myosin heavy chain (MHC) in surimi occurred during autolysis at 60 °C. In contrast, the levels of actin, troponin-T, and tropomyosin decreased only slightly. To prevent protein degradation by cathepsin L, a protease inhibitor was added to surimi. In the presence of 1.0% protease inhibitor, the autolysis of olive flounder surimi at 60 °C was inhibited by 12.2%; the degree of inhibition increased to 44.2% as the inhibitor concentration increased to 3.0%. In addition, the deformation and hardness of modori gel increased as the inhibitor concentration increased to 2.0%. Therefore, cathepsin L plays an important role in protein degradation in surimi, and the quality of surimi gel could be enhanced by inhibiting its activity."
0,"In order to investigate the species-specific heat tolerance of tropical fishes, the thermodynamic properties of muscle tropomyosin, a member of myofibrillar proteins, were compared among milkfish, tilapia, grouper, and mudskipper. The purified tropomyosins were subjected to differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism spectrometry. To unveil the relationship between the stability and the amino acid sequences, the muscle tropomyosin genes of the four species were also cloned, and their deduced amino acid sequences were compared. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the milkfish tropomyosin showed lower refolding ability after thermal denaturation, compared with those of the other species. The amino acid sequences of these tropomyosins were similar to each other, with the identity being in the range of 95-96%."
0,"Most fish-allergic patients have anti-β-parvalbumin (β-PV) immunoglobulin E (IgE), which cross-reacts among fish species with variable clinical effects. Although the β-PV load is considered a determinant for allergenicity, fish species express distinct β-PV isoforms with unknown pathogenic contributions. To identify the role various parameters play in allergenicity, we have taken Gadus morhua and Scomber japonicus models, determined their β-PV isoform composition and analyzed the interaction of the IgE from fish-allergic patient sera with these different conformations. We found that each fish species contains a major and a minor isoform, with the total PV content four times higher in Gadus morhua than in Scomber japonicus. The isoforms showing the best IgE recognition displayed protease-sensitive globular folds, and if forming amyloids, they were not immunoreactive. Of the isoforms displaying stable globular folds, one was not recognized by IgE under any of the conditions, and the other formed highly immunoreactive amyloids. The results showed that Gadus morhua muscles are equipped with an isoform combination and content that ensures the IgE recognition of all PV folds, whereas the allergenic load of Scomber japonicus is under the control of proteolysis. We conclude that the consideration of isoform properties and content may improve the explanation of fish species allergenicity differences."
0,"Following administration of deuterated water ((2)H2O), the fractional synthetic rate (FSR) of a given endogenous protein can be estimated by (2)H-enrichment quantification of its alanine residues. Currently, this is measured by mass spectrometry following a derivatization procedure. Muscle FSR was measured by (1)H/(2)H NMR analysis of alanine from seabass kept for 6 days in 5% (2)H-enriched saltwater, following acid hydrolysis and amino acid isolation by cation-exchange chromatography of muscle tissue. The analysis is simple and robust, and provides precise measurements of excess alanine (2)H-enrichment in the 0.1-0.4% range from 50 mmol of alanine recovered from muscle protein."
0,"Great amount of marine fish species have been identified with potential nutraceutical and medicinal values. Consequently, a number of bioactive compounds have been identified including fish muscle proteins, peptides, collagen and gelatin, fish oil, fish bone. Bioactive peptides derived from various fish muscle proteins have shown various biological activities including antihypertensive, antibacterial, anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities, and hence they may be a potential material for biomedical and food industries. Further, they are commonly used in medical and pharmaceutical industries as carrier molecules for drugs, proteins, and genes. Hence, fish muscle protein-derived peptides are valuable natural resources that can be potential material for biomedical, nutraceutical, and food industries."
0,"An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of replacement of fish meal (FM) with fish soluble meal (FSM) on growth performance, feed utilization and expression of genes involved in TOR signaling pathway for juvenile black sea bream (Acanthopagrus schlegelii). Six isonitrogenous (41%) and isolipidic diets were prepared to contain graded levels of FSM which replaced 0% (control diet), 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 60% protein from FM. Triplicate groups of 20 fish with initial weight 0.51 ± 0.01 g were fed with experimental diets twice daily to apparent satiation. The results showed significant differences in growth performance and feed utilization among all treatments, final body weight (FBW), percent weight gain (PWG), specific growth rate (SGR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) significantly increased with dietary replacement levels of FM with FSM increasing from 0% to 40% (P < 0.05), PWG, SGR and PER were significantly reduced when replacement of FM with FSM further increased from 40% to 60%. Based on PWG against replacement levels of FM with FSM, A two-slope broken-line model analysis indicated that the optimal replacement of FM with FSM is to be 42.59%. Moreover, the lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) was observed in fish fed the 40% FSM replacement diet. Muscle amino acid profile in muscle revealed that total essential amino acids, arginine and threonine were significantly influenced by replacement levels of FSM, while there was no significant difference in NEAA among all treatments. The hematological indices were not affected by the replacement levels of FM with FSM. The relative expression levels of irs-1, pi3k, akt, igf-1, s6k1 and tor were up-regulated when replacement levels of FM with FSM increased from 0% to 40%, and higher values were observed in fish fed with 40% FSM replacement diet compared to those fed the other diets. However, relative expression of 4e-bp2 was down-regulated when replacement levels of FM with FSM increased from 0% to 40% (P < 0.05). In summary, the results of present study indicated that FSM could be a viable alternative protein source for black sea bream, dietary FSM supplementation could improve growth and up-regulate the relative expression of irs-1, pi3k, akt, igf-1, s6k1 genes related to TOR signaling pathway in liver of juvenile black sea bream."
0,"Fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2) is involved in the uptake of dietary fatty acids and intracellular fatty acid transport. In the present study, cDNA of fabp2 in loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) was cloned and its full length was 956 bp, encoding 134 amino acids. Gene expression of fabp2 was investigated in different development stages and different tissues of loach, showing that the expression of fabp2 was recorded at 2 days after hatching (DAH), 10DAH, 20DAH and 35DAH, and higher in loach intestine, muscle and brain, compared with other tissues. We also investigated the effects of dietary oxidized fish oil (OFO) on the expression of intestinal fabp2 in loach juveniles by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time quantitative PCR. Fabp2 gene was expressed mainly by the intestinal epithelium cells of loach juveniles. The expression of intestinal fabp2 in loaches fed with OFO diet was significantly up-regulated on day 1 and 3, and down-regulated on day 10 after feeding, compared with those loaches fed with dietary fresh fish oil (FO), which were in accordance with the fluorescence intensities of FISH exhibiting in the corresponding feeding time. The present study indicated that dietary oxidized fish oil could affect the expression of fabp2 in the loach. Our results serve as reference to better understand the functional characterization of fabp2 in loach and other fish species."
0,"Biofilm composition from fish myofibrillar protein (FMP) and chitosan solution (CS) incorporated with rosemary extract (RE) was developed and applied to monitor the freshness of fish fillets. The effects of different concentrations of RE as well as physical, mechanical, structural and functional properties of FMP/CS films were investigated. Films containing RE showed reduced water solubility and water vapor permeability and enhanced tensile strength and elongation at break. Results also showed good compatibility of the components and good dispersion of RE in the matrix. However, the content of RE (0.2%, v/v) added in the composite films produced aggregations and had negative effects on their film-forming properties. The antioxidant capacity of composite films was related to the level of RE and demonstrated by the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging assay. Chilled grass carp fillets wrapped with different films to evaluate the preservative effect. Results of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, pH value, Free amino acid and total volatile basic nitrogen indicated that FMP/CS/RE composite film could protect the fish fillet well and inhibit the lipid oxidation. The developed FMP/CS/RE composite films possess the potential to be applied as edible films in the food packaging industry and food cold chain transportation."
0,"Striated muscle enables movement in all animals by the contraction of myriads of sarcomeres joined end to end by the Z-bands. The contraction is due to tension generated in each sarcomere between overlapping arrays of actin and myosin filaments. At the Z-band, actin filaments from adjoining sarcomeres overlap and are cross-linked in a regular pattern mainly by the protein α-actinin. The Z-band is dynamic, reflected by the 2 regular patterns seen in transverse section electron micrographs; the so-called small-square and basketweave forms. Although these forms are attributed, respectively, to relaxed and actively contracting muscles, the basketweave form occurs in certain relaxed muscles as in the muscle studied here. We used electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to derive the 3D structure of the Z-band in the swimbladder sonic muscle of type I male plainfin midshipman fish (<i>Porichthys notatus)</i>, into which we docked the crystallographic structures of actin and α-actinin. The α-actinin links run diagonally between connected pairs of antiparallel actin filaments and are oriented at an angle of about 25° away from the actin filament axes. The slightly curved and flattened structure of the α-actinin rod has a distinct fit into the map. The Z-band model provides a detailed understanding of the role of α-actinin in transmitting tension between actin filaments in adjoining sarcomeres."
0,"Female juveniles of the Neotropical fish Astyanax altiparanae were exposed for 96 h to four treatments containing the active ingredient from Imidacloprid® commercial formulation (IMI 1, IMI 2, IMI 3, and IMI 4) and to a control treatment (only dechlorinated tap water). Glutathione content, glutathione S-transferase activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation levels, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and frequency of micronuclei and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENA) were measured in the fish. The muscle and gills were the most affected organs; their antioxidant defense was not enough to prevent oxidative damage (LPO) in the IMI 2 and IMI 4 treatment fish. IMI also inhibited AChE activity in the muscle (IMI 3 and IMI 4) and increased ENA frequency (IMI 4). IMI can affect the health of A. altiparanae in environmentally relevant concentrations, causing oxidative damage in different organs, neurotoxic effects in the muscle, and genotoxicity."
0,"Protein oxidation in fish meat is considered to affect negatively the muscle texture. An important source of free radicals taking part in this process is Fenton's reaction dependent on ferrous ions present in the tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of cod muscle proteins in sarcoplasmic and myofibril fractions to in vitro metal-catalyzed oxidation and to point out protein candidates that might play a major role in the deterioration of fish quality. Extracted control proteins and proteins subjected to free radicals generated by Fe(II)/ascorbate mixture were labeled with fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide (FTSC) to tag carbonyl groups and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Consecutive visualization of protein carbonyl levels by capturing the FTSC signal and total protein levels by capturing the SyproRuby staining signal allowed us to quantify the relative change in protein carbonyl levels corrected for changes in protein content. Proteins were identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and homology-based searches. The results show that freshly extracted cod muscle proteins exhibit a detectable carbonylation background and that the incubation with Fe(II)/ascorbate triggers a further oxidation of both sarcoplasmic and myofibril proteins. Different proteins exhibited various degrees of sensitivity to oxidation processes. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (NDK), triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and enolase were the sarcoplasmic proteins most vulnerable to ferrous-catalyzed oxidation. Moreover, NDK, phosphoglycerate mutase, and GAPDH were identified in several spots differing by their pI, and those forms showed different susceptibilities to metal-catalyzed oxidation, indicating that post-translational modifications may change the resistance of proteins to oxidative damage. The Fe(II)/ascorbate treatment significantly increased carbonylation of important structural proteins in fish muscle, mainly actin and myosin, and degradation products of those proteins were observed, some of them exhibiting increased carbonylation levels."
0,"Fish proteins have been reported to be more satiating than meat proteins. The objective was to determine the effect of different animal protein pre-meals on satiety. A total of ten intact female hounds were fed pork loin, beef loin, chicken breast, salmon fillet or pollock fillet. Each pre-meal was fed to contain 100 g protein. Blood was collected at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min postprandially and analysed for glucose, insulin, total ghrelin, active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and plasma amino acids (AA). Dogs were fed 2 ×  metabolisable energy, 3 h following the pre-meal, and intake was determined 30, 60, 180 and 1440 min after food presentation. Glucose decreased over time (P < 0·001), but was lowest (P = 0·01) when dogs consumed pollock or chicken. Insulin increased (P < 0·0001) over time, and was greater (P = 0·09) when dogs consumed salmon. GLP-1 increased (P < 0·001) over time, and was greatest (P = 0·04) when dogs consumed beef. Ghrelin decreased (P < 0·0001) over time for all pre-meals. The tryptophan:large neutral AA ratio tended to be greater (P = 0·08) when dogs consumed pork, salmon and pollock. Different protein sources may influence blood markers in dogs, but it does not appear that fish substrates have different satiating abilities than mammalian or avian sources."
0,"In an effort to reduce the use of fishmeal (FM), the effect of using protein from poultry by product meal (PBM) along with the supplementation of three different fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) including yellowtail kingfish, carp and tuna hydrolysate (designated as KH, CH and TH, respectively) were evaluated in juvenile barramundi for growth performance, fillet quality, mucosal immunity, serum biochemistry, immune response and infection against Vibrio harveyi. Fish were fed a FM based control diet + three isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets containing 90% of PBM protein supplemented with different types of hydrolysates: 90% PBM +10% KH (90PBM + KH), 90% PBM + 10% CH (90PBM + CH) and 90% PBM + 10% TH (90PBM + TH). Growth performance and indices were unaffected by the hydrolysate supplemented diets when compared to the control. FPH supplemented PBM diets resulted in improved muscle quality by improving poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), ∑n-3, ∑n-6 and ∑n-9, and health related lipid indexes were not affected. The internal architecture of spleen and kidney were not altered by test diets whilst FPH supplemented PBM modulated acidic mucins in intestine and skin of fish. Improved infection rate in response to two weeks post infection with V. harveyi in the FPH supplemented diets was further associated with an increased serum immune response and a concomitant regulation of proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines in the head kidney. Serum biochemistry including alanine transaminase (ALT), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and total bilirubin (TB) showed a decreasing trend both in pre-challenge and post-challenge barramundi fed FPH supplemented diets whereas cholesterol level decreased significantly in post-challenge groups fed 90PBM + KH and 90PBM + TH than pre-challenge barramundi. This study signifies that supplementation of 10% with different three FPH, hydrolysed by an alcalase® enzyme in PBM-based diets for barramundi could be good strategies to overcome the negative consequences triggered by animal by-product ingredients."
0,"Fish is a protein-rich food and is increasingly favored by consumers. It has been well recognized that the flesh composition of fish is closely related to its maturation and growth stage, but few studies have explored these differences. Additionally, hormone residues in fish after artificial induction of reproduction also attract consumer concern. In this study, we attempt to address these concerns by using a combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses to identify key regulated pathways, genes, and metabolites that may affect the flesh nutrition of one typical aquaculture species in China, blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala)."
1,"The four groups of fish were used for transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses, including one-year-old immature (group I), two-year-old immature (group II), two-year-old mature (group III) and successfully spawned (group IV) female M. amblycephala after artificial induction of reproduction."
2,"We identified a total of 1460 differential compounds and 1107 differentially expressed unigenes in muscle among the different groups. Differential metabolites related to fish age (group II vs group I, group III vs group I) were largely enriched in ""Glycerophospholipid metabolism"", ""Linoleic acid metabolism"", ""α-Linolenic acid metabolism"", and ""Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids"". Between these two pairwise comparisons, metabolites that are beneficial to human health, such as docosapentaenoic acid, α-Linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid were found to be significantly decreased in two-year-old (group II, group III) compared with one-year-old (group I) M. amblycephala. Only one differential metabolite related to fish maturation, a triglyceride, was detected between groups III and II. Transcriptomics data showed that differently expressed genes (between group III vs group II, group III vs group I) related to maturation were highly enriched in ""Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)"", ""Sphingolipid metabolism"" and ""Phagosome"". DEGs (between group II vs group I, group III vs group I) relating to fish age were enriched in the ""cGMP-PKG signaling pathway"", ""FoxO signaling pathway"", and ""AMPK signaling pathway"". The gene-metabolite interaction network showed pivotal genes, including fumarate hydratase and GNPAT, which played a major role in the regulation of glycerphospholipid metabolism. The nutritional components were also measured, which verified the metabolomics results. Moreover, the metabolomics results showed that after 24 hours of artificial hormone injection, the drug was completely metabolized."
3,Integrated analysis demonstrated that the nutrition value of fish fillet was much more related to fish age compared with maturation status in M. amblycephala females.
0,"Low field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance was used in comparison to yield and physicochemical measurements to assess the effects of salt and protein injection on the properties of saithe (Pollachius virens) fillets during chilled and frozen storage. Saithe fillets injected with various combinations of salt, homogenized fish proteins, gelatine and fish protein hydrolyzate, were compared to the properties of untreated fillets. Addition of salt or fish protein hydrolyzate resulted in increased yield after cooking and water holding capacity compared to other treatments. Transversal relaxation data fitting resulted in three water populations with relaxation times of 27-45 ms, 60-99 ms and 187-341 ms. Relaxation times and respective populations showed significant correlation to various physicochemical properties, that muscle water behaviour was changed by salt and protein injection and indicated protein denaturation during frozen storage. Fish protein hydrolyzate injected fillets were most stable through storage, while gelatine injected fillets were most denatured during frozen storage. "
0,"The present study studied the effects of fish gelatin (FG) incorporated with grape seed extract (GSE) through vacuum impregnation (VI) on refrigerated tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fillets over 12 days. The VI of FG-GSE significantly improved the quality of the fish by decreasing drip loss, texture changes, and microbial survival. It also delayed protein oxidation by inhibiting the formation of disulphide bonds and carbonyl groups, and maintaining a higher sulfhydryl content and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity. Regarding myofibril degradation, FG-GSE maintained their secondary structure by increasing the ratio of α-helices and β-sheets (70.88-75.51%). Atomic force microscopy further revealed that the FG-GSE coating preserved the myofibril nanostructure by maintaining their length, width, and height. Overall, the synergistic effects of VI with 3% FG and 0.9% GSE suggested a promising approach for fillet preservation."
0,"Rapid industrialization results in the production of large quantities of waste that are commonly discharged into water bodies, leading to the damage of the aquatic ecosystem and freshwater organisms. Copper (Cu) can induce oxidative damage in fish muscle, the main fish portion that is consumed by humans. However, the responses of the Amazon fish Cichlasoma amazonarum and its capacity to withstand acute Cu concentrations found in Amazon water around mines remain unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether exposure to Cu causes muscle oxidative stress and/or oxidative damage and impairs the fillet fatty acid profile of C. amazonarum acutely exposed to Cu found in Amazon waters around mines. Muscle reactive oxygen species and protein carbonylation levels were significantly higher in fish exposed to 1500 μg/L Cu compared with the control group, while muscle lipid peroxidation levels were significantly higher in fish exposed to 500, 750, and 1500 μg/L Cu compared with control group. Muscle antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radical's levels and glutathione peroxidase activity were significantly lower in fish exposed to 1500 μg/L Cu compared with the control group, while muscle superoxide dismutase activity was significantly lower in fish exposed to 750 and 1500 μg/L Cu compared with control group. The total content of saturated fatty acids was significantly higher in fish exposed to 1500 μg/L Cu compared with the control group, while the total content of monounsaturated fatty acids and sum of n3 fatty acids were significantly lower in fish exposed to 1500 μg/L Cu compared with control group. No significant difference was observed regarding muscle catalase, glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione reductase activities. Based on these lines of evidence, the results of this comprehensive study agree with the initial hypothesis that the exposure to Cu found in Amazon water around mines induces oxidative damage and inhibits enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant response in the muscle of C. amazonarum exposed to high Cu levels. Moreover, the impairment of the fillet fatty acid profile appears to be mediated by oxidative damage, representing a negative impact on fish health."
0,"European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax, Linnaeus, 1758) (L) and gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata, Linnaeus, 1758) (C) muscles were hydrolysated by Alcalase (L<sub>alc</sub>, C<sub>alc</sub>) and Chymotrypsin (L<sub>ch</sub>, C<sub>ch</sub>) then hydrolysates were examined and their peptide profiles obtained. A total of 765, 794, 132 and 232 peptides were identified in C<sub>alc</sub>, L<sub>alc</sub>, C<sub>ch</sub> and L<sub>ch</sub>, respectively. Although, L<sub>ch</sub> and C<sub>ch</sub> were expected to have more antioxidant capacity because of their peptide profiles, Alcalase hydrolysates observed in vitro, were slightly higher (TEAC assay for C<sub>alc</sub>: 848.11 ± 60.78 μmol TE/g protein). Maximum inhibition of oxidative stress was determined for L<sub>alc</sub> (12.8% ± 4.5%) in MDCK1 cell lines. Highest proliferative capacity observed for C<sub>alc</sub> (147.0% ± 3.1%) at MTT assay in MDCK1 cell culture. L<sub>ch</sub> showed the highest chemopreventive effect with a 40-60% decrease for human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29.

0,"Current knowledge on the biological responses of freshwater fish under projected scenarios of climate change remains limited. Here, we examine differences in the protein configuration of two endemic Iberian freshwater fish species, Squalius carolitertii and the critically endangered S. torgalensis that inhabit in the Atlantic-type northern and in the Mediterranean-type southwestern regions, respectively. We performed protein structure modeling of fourteen genes linked to protein folding, energy metabolism, circadian rhythms and immune responses. Structural differences in proteins between the two species were found for HSC70, FKBP52, HIF1α and GPB1. For S. torgalensis, besides structural differences, we found higher thermostability for two proteins (HSP90 and GBP1), which can be advantageous in a warmer environment. Additionally, we investigated how these species might respond to projected scenarios of 3° climate change warming, acidification (ΔpH = -0.4), and their combined effects. Significant changes in gene expression were observed in response to all treatments, particularly under the combined warming and acidification. While S. carolitertii presented changes in gene expression for multiple proteins related to folding (hsp90aa1, hsc70, fkbp4 and stip1), only one such gene was altered in S. torgalensis (stip1). However, S. torgalensis showed a greater capacity for energy production under both the acidification and combined scenarios by increasing cs gene expression and maintaining ldha gene expression in muscle. Overall, these findings suggest that S. torgalensis is better prepared to cope with projected climate change. Worryingly, under the simulated scenarios, disturbances to circadian rhythm and immune system genes (cry1aa, per1a and gbp1) raise concerns for the persistence of both species, highlighting the need to consider multi-stressor effects when evaluating climate change impacts upon fish. This work also highlights that assessments of the potential of endangered freshwater species to cope with environmental change are crucial to help decision-makers adopt future conservation strategies."

0,"The present study was conducted to explore the mechanisms leading to differences among fishes in the ability to biosynthesize long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs). Replacement of fish oil with vegetable oil caused varied degrees of increase in 18-carbon fatty acid content and decrease in n-3 LC-PUFA content in the muscle and liver of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Japanese seabass (Lateolabrax japonicus) and large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), suggesting that these fishes have differing abilities to biosynthesize LC-PUFAs. Fish oil replacement also led to significantly up-regulated expression of FADS2 and SREBP-1 but different responses of the two PPAR-α homologues in the livers of these three fishes. An in vitro experiment indicated that the basic transcription activity of the FADS2 promoter was significantly higher in rainbow trout than in Japanese seabass or large yellow croaker, which was consistent with their LC-PUFA biosynthetic abilities. In addition, SREBP-1 and PPAR-α up-regulated FADS2 promoter activity. These regulatory effects varied considerably between SREBP-1 and PPAR-α, as well as among the three fishes. Taken together, the differences in regulatory activities of the two transcription factors targeting FADS2 may be responsible for the different LC-PUFA biosynthetic abilities in these three fishes that have adapted to different ambient salinity."
0,"The matrix effect is considered to be a problem in the immunoassay of foodstuffs. However, information on the interference from aquatic products, as well as the mechanism involved, is very limited. In this study, using three flatfishes (Scophthalmus maximus, Paralichthys olivaceus and Cymoglossus robustus) as samples, the effect of the fish matrix on the competitive indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ci-ELISA) of antibiotic (norfloxacin) residues was investigated. The mechanism of the observed matrix effect is also preliminarily discussed."
1,"Within the working range of the calibration curves, a significant (P = 0.05) but irregular variation in the inhibition ratio was observed in the presence of fish extracts. Further experiments revealed that such a matrix effect could be caused by some water-soluble fish proteins with a wide range of molecular weight (from below 14.4 kDa to about 116.0 kDa), and the ions from fish muscles may also contribute to the interference. The results of western blotting indicated that some fish protein components might effectively bind with antibody reagents used."
2,"Significant interference in the immunoassay of norfloxacin was observed in the presence of fish matrix. Some proteins and ions were demonstrated to contribute to the matrix effect investigated. Although the detailed mechanism is still unclear, the non-specific interaction between fish proteins and immunoglobulin G (IgG) or horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labelled IgG was assumed to be an important source of the matrix effect in immunoassays."
0,"In the last years, food proteins and peptides are attracting great attention because of the emergence of a new field, that of food-derived bioactive peptides. This paper presents a comparison and evaluation of four different experiments for the identification of sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar fish peptides. This study is aimed at the development of a simple and fast method for the identification of peptides that could arise from fish meat if trypsin was the only digestive enzyme acting on fish meat proteins. In particular, we tested the use of ultrafiltration membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 3,000 Da. Data analysis has shown that the experiment in which there is neither precipitation nor an ultrafiltration step performed better and allowed the identification of a larger number of peptides and potential antimicrobial peptides (AMPs); this workflow provided 473 and 398 total identified peptides and 44 and 18 AMPs for sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar extracts, respectively. This protocol is found to be faster and more straightforward than the other three tested workflows. The developed strategy could be also useful for other food matrices and could provide information about food quality and safety control. "
0,"In fish used for food production and scientific research, fast growth can be achieved via selective breeding or induced instantaneously via growth hormone (GH) transgenesis (GHT). The proteomic basis for these distinct routes towards a similar higher phenotype remains uncharacterized, as are associated implications for health parameters. We addressed this knowledge gap using skeletal muscle proteomics in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), hypothesising that i) selective breeding and GHT are underpinned by both parallel and unique changes in growth systems, and ii) rapidly-growing fish strains have lowered scope to allocate resources towards immune function. Quantitative profiling of GHT and growth-selected strains was done in comparison to wild-type after injection with PBS (control) or Poly I:C (to mimic infection). We identified remodelling of the muscle proteome in each growth-enhanced strain that was strikingly non-overlapping. GHT was characterized by focal upregulation of systems driving protein synthesis, while the growth-selected fish presented a larger and more diverse set of changes, consistent with complex alterations to many metabolic and cellular pathways. Poly I:C had little detectable effect on the muscle proteome. This study demonstrates that distinct proteome profiles can explain outwardly similar enhanced growth phenotypes, improving our understanding of growth mechanisms in anthropogenic animal strains. SIGNIFICANCE: This work provides the first proteomic insights into mechanisms underpinning different anthropogenic routes to rapid growth in salmon. High-throughput proteomic profiling was used to reveal changes supporting enhanced growth, comparing skeletal muscle of growth hormone transgenic (GHT) and selectively-bred salmon strains with their wild-type counterparts. Contrasting past mRNA-level comparisons of the same fish strains, our data reveals a surprisingly substantial proteomic divergence between the GHT and selectively bred strains. The findings demonstrate that many unique molecular mechanisms underlie growth-enhanced phenotypes in different types of fish strain used for food production and scientific research."
0,"Protein recovery for fish processing by-products utilizes extreme pH shifts for isoelectric solubilization and precipitation. The purpose of this study was to determine if Escherichia coli would survive exposure to the extreme pH shifts during the protein recovery process. Fresh rainbow trout were beheaded, gutted, and minced and then inoculated with approximately 10(9) CFU of E. coli ATCC 25922 per g, homogenized, and brought to the target pH of 2.0, 3.0, 11.5, or 12.5 by the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide to solubilize muscle proteins. The homogenate was blended and centrifuged to separate the lipid and insoluble components (bones, skin, insoluble protein, etc.) from the protein solution. The protein solution was subjected to a second pH shift (pH 5.5) resulting in protein precipitation that was recovered with centrifugation. Microbial analysis was conducted on each fraction (i.e., lipid, insoluble components, protein, and water) with selective and nonselective media. The sums of the surviving E. coli in these fractions were compared with the initial inoculum. The greatest total microbial reduction occurred when the pH was shifted to 12.5 (P < 0.05), i.e., a 4.4-log reduction of cells on nonselective media and a 6.0-log reduction of cells on selective media. The use of selective and nonselective media showed that there was significant (P < 0.05) injury sustained by cells exposed to alkaline treatment (pH 11.5 and 12.5) in all fractions except the insoluble fraction at pH 11.5. Increasing the exposure time or the pH may result in greater bacterial reductions in the recovered protein."
0,"Lamin is an intermediate protein underlying the nuclear envelope and it plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of the nucleus. A defect in the processing of its precursor by a metalloprotease, ZMPSTE24, results in the accumulation of farnesylated prelamin in the nucleus and causes various diseases, including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). However, the role of lamin processing is unclear in fish species. Here, we generated zmpste24-deficient medaka and evaluated their phenotype. Unlike humans and mice, homozygous mutants did not show growth defects or lifespan shortening, despite lamin precursor accumulation. Gonadosomatic indices, blood glucose levels, and regenerative capacity of fins were similar in 1-year-old mutants and their wild-type (WT) siblings. Histological examination showed that the muscles, subcutaneous fat tissues, and gonads were normal in the mutants at the age of 1 year. However, the mutants showed hypersensitivity to X-ray irradiation, although p53target genes, p21 and mdm2, were induced 6 h after irradiation. Immunostaining of primary cultured cells from caudal fins and visualization of nuclei using H2B-GFP fusion proteins revealed an abnormal nuclear shape in the mutants both in vitro and in vivo. The telomere lengths were significantly shorter in the mutants compared to WT. Taken together, these results suggest that zmpste24-deficient medaka phenocopied HGPS only partially and that abnormal nuclear morphology and lifespan shortening are two independent events in vertebrates."
0,"Matrinxã (Brycon amazonicus) is a great swimming performance teleost fish from the Amazon basin. However, the possible cardiac adaptations of this ability are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to investigate the effects of prolonged exercise (EX group - 60days under 0.4BL·s<sup>-1</sup>) on ventricular contractility by (i) in-vitro analysis of contractility comparing the relative roles of sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling and (ii) molecular analysis of NCX, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA2) and phospholamban (PLB) expression and quantification. The exercise training significantly improved twitch tension, cardiac pumping capacity and the contraction rate when compared to controls (CT). Inhibition of the NCX function, replacing Na<sup>+</sup> by Li<sup>+</sup> in the physiological solutions, diminished cardiac contractility in the EX group, reduced all analyzed parameters under both high and low stimulation frequencies. The SR blockage, using 10μM ryanodine, caused ~50% tension reduction in CT at most analyzed frequencies while in EX, reductions (34-54%) were only found at higher frequencies. SR inhibition also decreased contraction and relaxation rates in both groups. Additionally, higher post-rest contraction values were recorded for EX, indicating an increase in SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading. Higher NCX and PLB expression rates and lower SERCA2 rates were found in EX. Our data indicate that matrinxã presents a modulation in E-C coupling after exercise-training, enhancing the SR function under higher frequencies. This was the first study to functionally analyze the effects of swimming-induced exercise on fish cardiac E-C coupling."
0,"Skeletal muscle is a highly adaptable tissue capable of remodeling when dynamic stress is altered, including changes in mechanical loading and stretch. When muscle is subjected to an unloaded state (e.g., bedrest, immobilization, spaceflight) the resulting loss of muscle cross sectional area (CSA) impairs force production. In addition, muscle fiber-type shifts from slow to fast-twitch fibers. Unloading also results in a downregulation of heat shock proteins (e.g., HSP70) and anabolic signaling, which further exacerbate these morphological changes. Our lab recently showed reactive oxygen species (ROS) are causal in unloading-induced alterations in Akt and FoxO3a phosphorylation, muscle fiber atrophy, and fiber-type shift. Nutritional supplements such as fish oil and curcumin enhance anabolic signaling, glutathione levels, and heat shock proteins. We hypothesized that fish oil, rich in omega-3-fatty acids, combined with the polyphenol curcumin would enhance stress protective proteins and anabolic signaling in the rat soleus muscle, concomitant with synergistic protection of morphology. C57BL/6 mice were assigned to 3 groups (n = 6/group): ambulatory controls (CON), hindlimb unloading (HU), and hindlimb unloading with 5% fish oil, 1% curcumin in diet (FOC). FOC treatments began 10 days prior to HU and tissues were harvested following 7 days of HU. FOC mitigated the unloading induced decrease in CSA. FOC also enhanced abundance of HSP70 and anabolic signaling (Akt phosphorylation, p70S6K phosphorylation), while reducing Nox2, a source of oxidative stress. Therefore, we concluded that the combination of fish oil and curcumin prevents skeletal muscle atrophy due to a boost of heat shock proteins and anabolic signaling in an unloaded state."
0,"The ability of diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)2] to attenuate oxidative damage was evaluated in the liver, gills, brain, and muscle of carp (Cyprinus carpio) and silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) experimentally exposed to fipronil (FPN). Initially, the fish were fed a diet without (PhSe)2 or a diet containing 3.0 mg/kg of (PhSe)2 for 60 days. After the 60-day period, the fish were exposed to 0.65 µg/L of FPN for 192 h. The results showed that carp exposed to FPN and not fed with (PhSe)2 exhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition in brain and muscle, and increased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) in liver, gills, and brain. Furthermore, FPN decreased nonprotein thiols (NPSH) and δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase (δ-ALA-D) in carp liver and gills, and increased plasma glucose and protein levels. In silver catfish, FPN inhibited AChE and increased TBARS levels in muscle. In addition, glutathione S-transferase (GST) decreased in liver and muscle, and plasma glucose was increased. (PhSe)2 reversed some of these effects. It prevented the increase in TBARS levels in liver, gills, and brain in carp and in silver catfish muscle, and reversed the increase in plasma glucose levels in both species. Additionally, (PhSe)2 increased the NPSH levels in carp and silver catfish that had decreased in response to FPN exposure. However, (PhSe)2 was not effective in reversing the AChE inhibition in brain and muscle or the δ-ALA-D decrease in carp liver. Thus, (PhSe)2 protects tissues of both species of fish, mainly by preventing or counteracting the effects of FPN, on TBARS levels, antioxidants, and present anti-hyperglycemic property. "
0,"Myoglobin (Mb) is an oxygen-binding hemoprotein that was once thought to be exclusively expressed in oxidative myocytes of skeletal and cardiac muscle where it serves in oxygen storage and facilitates intracellular oxygen diffusion. In this study, we cloned the coding sequence of the Mb gene from four species, representing three groups, of the schizothoracine fish endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), then conducted molecular evolution analyses. We also investigated tissue expression patterns of Mb and the expression response to moderate and severe hypoxia at the mRNA and protein levels in a representative of the highly specialized schizothoracine fish species, Schizopygopsis pylzovi. Molecular evolution analyses showed that Mb from the highly specialized schizothoracine fish have undergone positive selection and one positively selected residue (81L) was identified, which is located in the F helix, close to or in contact with the heme. We present tentative evidence that the Mb duplication event occurred in the ancestor of the schizothoracine and Cyprininae fish (common carp and goldfish), and that the Mb2 paralog was subsequently lost in the schizothoracine fish. In S. pylzovi, Mb mRNA is expressed in various tissues with the exception of the intestine and gill, but all such tissues, including the liver, muscle, kidney, brain, eye, and skin, expressed very low levels of Mb mRNA (< 8.0%) relative to that of the heart. The trace levels of Mb expression in non-muscle tissues are perhaps the major reason why non-muscle Mb remained undiscovered for so long. The expression response of the Mb gene to hypoxia at the mRNA and protein levels was strikingly different in S. pylzovi compared to that found in the common carp, medaka, zebrafish, and goldfish, suggesting that the hypoxia response of Mb in fish may be species and tissue-specific. Notably, severe hypoxia induced significant expression of Mb at the mRNA and protein levels in the S. pylzovi heart, which suggests Mb has a major role in the supply of oxygen to the heart of Tibetan Plateau fish."
0,"<b>Purpose:</b> Nutritional supplementation in conjunction with exercise is of interest for the prevention or improvement of declines in motor performances in older adults. An understanding of the effects on both young and older adults contributes to its effective application. We investigated the effect of fish protein ingestion with resistance training on neural and muscular adaptations in young adults using interventions and assessments that have already been tested in older adults. <b>Methods:</b> Eighteen young adults underwent 8 weeks of isometric knee extension training. During the intervention, nine participants ingested 5 g of fish protein (<i>n</i> = 9, Alaska pollack protein, APP), and the other nine participants ingested casein as a control (<i>n</i> = 9, CAS) in addition to daily meals. Before, during, and after the intervention, the isometric knee extension force, lower extremity muscle mass, and motor unit firing pattern of knee extensor muscles were measured. <b>Results:</b> Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was significantly increased in both APP and CAS groups from 0 weeks to 4, 6, and 8 weeks of intervention (<i>p</i> < 0.001), but there were no significant differences between the groups (<i>p</i> = 0.546-0.931). Muscle mass was not significantly changed during the intervention in either group (<i>p</i> = 0.250-0.698). Significant changes in motor unit firing rates (<i>p</i> = 0.02 and 0.029 for motor units recruited at 20-40% of MVC and at 40-60%) were observed following the intervention in the APP but not CAS (<i>p</i> = 0.120-0.751) group. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results suggest that dietary fish protein ingestion changes motor unit adaptations following resistance training in young adults."
0,"Fish muscle firmness is an important quality trait for consumer acceptance. Phosphorylation is known to change chemical and physical properties of proteins and is thus expected to affect muscle firmness, but only few such phosphoproteins have been identified. To explore phosphoproteins that affect fish muscle firmness, firm muscle (crisp grass carp) and soft muscle (ordinary grass carp) were analyzed by quantitative phosphoproteomics. We identified 27 up-regulated and 22 down-regulated phosphopeptides in crisp grass carp (ratio ≥1.5 or ≤0.667, and P-value < 0.05) and their potential upstream kinases. Protein-protein interaction analysis clustered these phosphoproteins into four groups, many of which have been suggested to impact muscle firmness and its postmortem changes: muscle fiber, connective tissue, carbohydrate metabolism and signal regulation. These results provide novel insights into the role of protein phosphorylation in fish muscle firmness and will contribute to the quality improvement of fish products."
0,Fish protein hydrolysates (FPHs) have been reported as a suitable source of proteins for human nutrition because of their balanced amino acid composition and positive effect on gastrointestinal absorption.
1,"Here, we investigated the effect of a FPH, Slimpro(®), obtained from blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) muscle by enzymatic hydrolysis, on body composition and on stimulating cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion."
2,"A randomized clinical study was carried out on 120, slightly overweight (25 kg/m(2) ≤ BMI<30 kg/m(2)), male (25%) and female (75%) subjects. FPH was tested in a food supplement at two doses (1.4 and 2.8 g) to establish if a dose-effect relationship exists. Product use was associated with a mild hypocaloric diet (-300 kcal/day). Body composition (body weight; fat mass; extracellular water; and circumference of waist, thighs, and hips) and CCK/GLP-1 blood levels were measured at the beginning of the study and after 45 and 90 days of product use. CCK/GLP-1 levels were measured since they are involved in controlling food intake."
3,"Treated subjects reported an improvement of body weight composition and an increased blood concentration of both CCK and GLP-1. No differences were found between the 1.4 and 2.8 g FPH doses, indicating a plateau effect starting from 1.4 g FPH."
4,Both 1.4 and 2.8 g of FPH were effective in improving body composition and in increasing CCK and GLP-1 blood levels.
0,"The functionality of fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) for the microencapsulation of fish oil was investigated. Muscle protein from sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and horse mackerel (Trachurus mediterraneus) was hydrolysed using Alcalase or trypsin. Physically stable emulsions suitable for spray-drying were obtained when using FPH with a degree of hydrolysis of 5%. Microencapsulation efficiency amounted to 98±0.1% and oxidative stability of the encapsulated oil over a period of twelve weeks was in a similar range as it is reported for other matrix systems. Therefore, the suitability of FPH for use in spray-dried emulsions has been shown for the first time. Since no clear correlation between the antioxidative activity of the FPH and the course of lipid oxidation could be established future research is required to more specifically characterise the molecular structure of the peptides and its impact on protein alteration and role in lipid oxidation."
0,"This study presents data on the extraction and characterization of proteins associated with mercury in the muscle and liver tissues of jaraqui (Semaprochilodus spp.) from the Madeira River in the Brazilian Amazon. Protein fractionation was carried out by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Mercury determination in tissues, pellets, and protein spots was performed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). Proteins in the spots that showed mercury were characterized by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The highest mercury concentrations were found in liver tissues and pellets (426 ± 6 and 277 ± 4 μg kg<sup>-1</sup>), followed by muscle tissues and pellets (132 ± 4 and 86 ± 1 μg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). Mercury quantification in the protein spots allowed us to propose stoichiometric ratios in the range of 1-4 mercury atoms per molecule of protein in the protein spots. The proteins characterized in the analysis by ESI-MS/MS were keratin, type II cytoskeletal 8, parvalbumin beta, parvalbumin-2, ubiquitin-40S ribosomal S27a, 39S ribosomal protein L36 mitochondrial, hemoglobin subunit beta, and hemoglobin subunit beta-A/B. The results suggest that proteins such as ubiquitin-40S ribosomal protein S27a, which have specific domains, possibly zinc finger, can be used as biomarkers of mercury, whereas mercury and zinc present characteristics of soft acids."
0,"Myostatin (MSTN) is a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth, and its activity is suppressed by MSTN propeptide (MSTNpro), the N-terminal part of MSTN precursor cleaved during post-translational MSTN processing. The current study examined which region of flatfish (Paralichthys olivaceus) MSTN-1 propeptide (MSTN1pro) is critical for MSTN inhibition. Six different truncated forms of MSTN1pro containing N-terminal maltose binding protein (MBP) as a fusion partner were expressed in Escherichia coli, and partially purified by an affinity chromatography for MSTN-inhibitory activity examination. Peptides covering different regions of flatfish MSTN1pro were also synthesized for MSTN-inhibitory activity examination. A MBP-fused MSTN1pro region consisting of residues 45-100 had the same MSTN-inhibitory potency as the full sequence flatfish MSTN1pro (residues 23-265), indicating that the region of flatfish MSTN1pro consisting of residues 45-100 is sufficient to maintain the full MSTN-inhibitory capacity. A MBP-fused MSTN1pro region consisting of residues 45-80 (Pro45-80) also showed MSTN-inhibitory activity with a lower potency, and the Pro45-80 demonstrated its MSTN binding capacity in a pull-down assay, indicating that the MSTN-inhibitory capacity of Pro45-80 is due to its binding to MSTN. Flatfish MSTN1pro synthetic peptides covering residues 45-65, 45-70, and 45-80 demonstrated MSTN-inhibitory activities, but not the synthetic peptide covering residues 45-54, indicating that residues 45-65 of flatfish MSTN1pro are essential for MSTN inhibition. In conclusion, current study show that like the mammalian MSTNpro, the MSTN-inhibitory region of flatfish MSTN1pro resides near its N-terminus, and imply that smaller sizes of MSTNpro can be effectively used in various applications designed for MSTN inhibition.

0,"In vertebrates, myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) play an important role in muscle growth through the processes of cell determination and differentiation. Herein, we report the molecular characterisation of two MRFs, myogenin (myog) and myogenic factor 6 (myf6) in Indian snow trout Schizothorax richardsonii. The full length mRNA sequence of Srmyog and Srmyf6 was 1437 and 1296 bp, with an ORF of 762 and 720 bp, encoding a putative protein of 253 and 239 amino acids, respectively. In silico analysis and predicted tertiary protein structure revealed that both these nuclear localized MRFs contained the highly conserved basic helix loop helix motif, to potentially aid in dimerization with functional partners and DNA binding. Phylogenetically, the deduced protein sequences of Srmyog and Srmyf6 closely clustered with high altitude dwelling cyprinids, suggesting common ancestry. Tissue-wise, transcripts of Srmyog and Srmyf6 were abundant in skeletal muscle, affirming their muscle-specific role. Moreover, Srmyog was highly expressed in females as compared to males, whereas Srmyf6 expression was higher in older-bigger individuals as compared to younger-smaller fish. Nutritional status (fed-starved-refed) and diet composition (protein and lipid levels) had no significant influence on Srmyog expression. But, Srmyf6 expression was elevated in fishes re-fed after 3 weeks of starvation and in those fed low protein diet. Only rearing temperature was found to coherently influence Srmyog and Srmyf6 transcripts, with highest expression at 18 °C, which favoured growth. Overall, molecular characterisation of the structure and regulation of these MRFs is the first step taken towards deciphering slow growth in this important Himalayan cyprinid."
0,"In this study, the binding behaviour of methylmercury (MeHg(+)) towards proteins is investigated. Free sulfhydryl groups in cysteine residues are known to be the most likely binding partners, due to the high affinity of mercury to sulphur. However, detailed knowledge about discrete binding sites in living organisms has been so far scarce. A metallomics approach using different methods like size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) as well as complementary mass spectrometric techniques (electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry, ESI-MS/MS) are combined to sequence and identify possible target proteins or peptides after enzymatic digestion. Potential targets for MeHg(+) in tuna fish muscle tissue are investigated using the certified reference material CRM464 as a model tissue. Different extraction procedures appropriate for the extraction of proteins are evaluated for their efficiency using isotope dilution analysis for the determination of total Hg in the extracts. Due to the high chemical stability of the mercury-sulphur bond, the bioconjugate can be quantitatively extracted with a combination of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). Using different separation techniques such as SEC and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it can be shown that major binding occurs to a high-molecular weight protein (M(w) > 200 kDa). A potential target protein, skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain, could be identified after tryptic digestion and capillary LC-ESI-MS/MS."
0,"The experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary threonine (Thr) on growth performance and muscle growth, protein synthesis and antioxidant-related signalling pathways of hybrid catfish Pelteobagrus vachelli♀ × Leiocassis longirostris♂. A total of 1200 fish (14·19 (se 0·13) g) were randomly distributed into six groups with four replicates each, fed six diets with graded level of Thr (9·5, 11·5, 13·5, 15·4, 17·4 and 19·3 g/kg diets) for 56 d. Results showed (P < 0·05) that dietary Thr (1) increased percentage weight gain, specific growth rate, feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio; (2) up-regulated growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen, myogenic regulation factors (MyoD, Myf5, MyoG and Mrf4) and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) mRNA levels; (3) increased muscle protein content via regulating the protein kinase B/target of rapamycin signalling pathway and (4) decreased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents, increased catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase and GSH activities, up-regulated mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes related to NFE2-related factor 2 and γ-glutamylcysteine ligase catalytic subunit. These results suggest that Thr has a potential role to improve muscle growth and protein synthesis, which might be due to the regulation of GH-IGF system, muscle growth-related gene, antioxidative capacity and protein synthesis-related signalling pathways. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of specific growth rate, the Thr requirement of hybrid catfish (14·19-25·77 g) was estimated to be 13·77 g/kg of the diet (33·40 g/kg of dietary protein)."
0,"The development of metallomics techniques has allowed for metallomics analysis of biological systems, enabling a better understanding of the response mechanisms for different stimuli, their relationship to metallic species, and the characterization of biomarkers. In this study, a metallomics analysis of the muscle tissue of Nile tilapia was used to aid the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in zinc absorption in this fish species when fed organic and/or inorganic sources of zinc and to identify possible biomarkers for the absorption of this micromineral. To accomplish this, the fish were separated into three groups of 24 g, 74 g, and 85 g initial weights, and each group, respectively, was fed a zinc-free diet (control group, G1), a diet containing zinc found in organic sources (treatment 1, G2), and a diet containing zinc from an inorganic source (treatment 2, G3). Two-dimensional polyacrylamide (2D PAGE) gel electrophoresis was used to separate the proteins of the muscle tissue. Subsequently, the expression profiles of protein spots in the samples where zinc was applied in different concentrations were compared, using the software ImageMaster 2D Platinum version 7.0, to identify proteins that were differentially expressed. The identified proteins were then exposed to atomic absorption spectrometry in a graphite furnace to determine zinc mapping and were subsequently characterized via electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The metallomic analysis identified 15 proteins differentially expressed and associated with zinc, leading to the conclusion that three metal-binding proteins presented as possible biomarkers of zinc absorption in fish."
0,"Electric organs (EOs) have evolved independently in vertebrates six times from skeletal muscle (SM). The transcriptional changes accompanying this developmental transformation are not presently well understood. Mormyrids and gymnotiforms are two highly convergent groups of weakly electric fish that have independently evolved EOs: while much is known about development and gene expression in gymnotiforms, very little is known about development and gene expression in mormyrids. This lack of data limits prospects for comparative work. We report here on the characterization of 28 differentially expressed genes between SM and EO tissues in the mormyrid Brienomyrus brachyistius, which were identified using suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH). Forward and reverse SSH was performed on tissue samples of EO and SM resulting in one cDNA library enriched with mRNAs expressed in EO, and a second library representing mRNAs unique to SM. Nineteen expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified in EO and nine were identified in SM using BLAST searching of Danio rerio sequences available in NCBI databases. We confirmed differential expression of all 28 ESTs using RT-PCR. In EO, these ESTs represent four classes of proteins: (1) ion pumps, including the α- and β-subunits of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, and a plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase; (2) Ca(2+)-binding protein S100, several parvalbumin paralogs, calcyclin-binding protein and neurogranin; (3) sarcomeric proteins troponin I, myosin heavy chain and actin-related protein complex subunit 3 (Arcp3); and (4) the transcription factors enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH) and myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A). Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to demonstrate the translation of seven proteins (myosin heavy chain, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase, MEF2, troponin and parvalbumin) and their cellular localization in EO and SM. Our findings suggest that mormyrids express several paralogs of muscle-specific genes and the proteins they encode in EOs, unlike gymnotiforms, which may post-transcriptionally repress several sarcomeric proteins. In spite of the similarity in the physiology and function of EOs in mormyrids and gymnotiforms, this study indicates that the mechanisms of development in the two groups may be considerably different."
0,"Grass carp is one of the most important freshwater aquaculture species in China. However, the mechanisms underlying the growth of muscle tissue in the fish are unclear. High-throughput RNA-Seq was used to analyze the transcriptome of grass carp muscle tissue between fast- and slow-growing fish family groups. Twenty-four individuals each from 4 fast-growing families and 4 slow-growing families were used to reduce background noise. 71 up-regulated and 35 down-regulated genes were identified in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed the DEGs were involved in the GH/IGF axis, calcium metabolism, protein and glycogen synthesis, oxygen transport, cytoskeletal and myofibrillar components. IGFBP1 was up-regulated in big fish while GHR2 was down-regulated. Glutamic pyruvate transaminase 2, an indicator of liver tissue damage, was down-regulated in big grass carp, which indicates that the fish was better adapted to an artificially formulated diet. GAPDH, the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolytic flux was highly expressed in fast-growing grass carp, reflecting enhanced carbohydrate metabolism. Higher expression of ALAS2 and myoglobin 1 in big grass carp, related to oxygen transport might promote aerobic exercise along with food intake and muscle growth. Genes for cytoskeletal and myofibrillar components such as tropomyosin, meromyosin, and troponin I were also up-regulated in big grass carp. These results provide valuable information about the key genes for use as biomarkers of growth in selective breeding programs for grass carp and contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and regulative pathways regulating growth in fish."
0,"Olive leaf is known to have the high polyphenol content of 6-9% in dry weight. We investigated the effects of olive leaf powder (OLP) supplemented to fish feed on muscle protein of red sea bream (Pagrus major). Fish reared with feed containing 8% OLP for 40 days had 1.4 times higher myofibril content and 2.2 times higher acid-soluble collagen content than fish reared with control feed for the same period. On the other hand, sarcoplasmic protein content and collagenase activity of the muscle were almost the same between the control fish and OLP-diet fish. Microstructure observation of fish muscle showed that OLP-diet fish has more rigid endomysium structure than that of the control-diet fish. Since collagen fiber in endomysium is responsible for the texture of the muscle, feeding OLP to aquaculture fish will lead to a harder muscle texture. The present study suggests that OLP is a useful feed additive to enhance the texture of aquaculture red sea bream muscle through strengthening of the collagen structure in the muscle."
0,"The two-month effects of dietary fish protein and casein on VLDL, HDL(2) and HDL(3) compositions and hepatic lipase (HTGL) and tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activities were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at 4 wk of age. After 2 mo of experiment, the fish protein diet induced lower blood pressure (-14 %) as compared to casein. Liver triacylglycerol and total cholesterol concentrations were 1.37- and 1.71-fold lower in the fish protein group than in the casein group, respectively. Total cholesterol concentration in plasma was also diminished by fish protein (-21 %) and was reflected in HDL(2) fraction (-44 %). SHR fed the fish protein diet as compared with those fed casein, showed a significantly low HDL(3) particle number, as measured by diminished HDL(3) mass and apo A-I. The consumption of fish protein did not affect VLDL particle number, but significantly decreased VLDL-triacylglycerol (-32 %) and adipose tissue total lipid concentrations as compared to casein. This was accompanied by diminished HTGL and adipose tissue LPL activities (-10%, -91%, respectively). These data demonstrate that fish protein plays an antihypertensive role and reduces plasma and tissue lipid concentrations. Thus, a fish protein intake might be beneficial for patients with hypertension."

Furthermore, Lys and Arg promoted the formation of aggregation-type gel with a dense and compact structure observed by scanning electron microscopy. The gels containing 15/20 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> Lys/Arg exhibited a significant increase in the proportion of immobilized water (P<sub>21</sub> )."

0,"Dietary fish oil intake improves muscle atrophy in several atrophy models however the effect on denervation-induced muscle atrophy is not clear. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary fish oil intake on muscle atrophy and the expression of muscle atrophy markers induced by sciatic nerve denervation in mice. We performed histological and quantitative mRNA expression analysis of muscle atrophy markers in mice fed with fish oil with sciatic nerve denervation. Histological analysis indicated that dietary fish oil intake slightly prevented the decrease of muscle fiber diameter induced by denervation treatment. In addition, dietary fish oil intake suppressed the MuRF1 (tripartite motif-containing 63) expression up-regulated by denervation treatment, and this was due to decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production in skeletal muscle. We concluded that dietary fish oil intake suppressed MuRF1 expression by decreasing TNF-α production during muscle atrophy induced by sciatic nerve denervation in mice."
0,"To identify muscle-related protein isoforms expressed in the white muscle of the mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi, we analyzed 5,063 high-quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from white muscle cDNA library and predicted the integrity of the clusters annotated to these genes and the physiochemical properties of the putative polypeptides with full length. Up to about 33% of total ESTs were annotated to muscle-related proteins: myosin, actin, tropomyosin/troponin complex, parvalbumin, and Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCa). Thirty-two isoforms were identified and more than one isoform existed in each of these proteins. Among these isoforms, 14 putative polypeptides were with full length. In addition, about 2% of total ESTs were significantly homologous to ""glue"" molecules such as alpha-actinins, myosin-binding proteins, myomesin, tropomodulin, cofilin, profilin, twinfilins, coronin-1, and nebulin, which were required for the integrity and maintenance of the muscle sarcomere. The results demonstrated that multiple isoforms of major muscle-related proteins were expressed in S. chuatsi white muscle. The analysis on these isoforms and other proteins sequences will greatly aid our systematic understanding of the high flexibility of mandarin fish white muscle at molecular level and expand the utility of fish systems as models for the muscle genetic control and function."
0,"A bioactive peptide mimicking peptide-signaling molecules has been isolated from the skin extract of fish Channa argus which caused contraction of the apical muscle of a starfish Patiria pectinifera, a deuterostomian invertebrate. The primary structure of the isolated pentapeptide comprises amino acid sequence of H-Pro-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu-OH (PALAL) with a molecular mass of 483.7 Da. Pharmacological activity of PALAL, dosage ranging from 10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> M, revealed concentration-dependent contraction of the apical muscles of P. pectinifera and Asterias amurensis. However, PALAL was not active on the intestinal smooth muscle of the goldfish Carassius auratus and has presumably other physiological roles in fish skin. Investigation of structure-activity relationship using truncated and substituted analogs of PALAL demonstrated that H-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu-OH was necessary and should be sufficient to constrict apical muscle of P. pectinifera. Furthermore, the second alanine residue was required to display the activity, and the fifth leucine residue was responsible for its potency. Comparison with PALAL's primary structure with those of other known bioactive peptides from fish and starfish revealed that PALAL does not have any significant homology. Consequently, PALAL is a bioactive peptide that elicits a muscle contraction in starfish, and the isolation of PALAL may lead to develop other bioactive peptides sharing its similar sequence and/or activity.

0,"Obesity is known to cause skeletal muscle wasting. This study investigated the effect and the possible mechanism of fish oil on skeletal muscle wasting in an obese rat model. High-fat (HF) diets were applied to induce the defects of lipid metabolism in male Sprague-Dawley rats with or without substitution of omega-3 fatty acids-enriched fish oil (FO, 5%) for eight weeks. Diets supplemented with 5% FO showed a significant decrease in the final body weight compared to HF diet-fed rats. The decreased soleus muscle weights in HF diet-fed rats could be improved by FO substitution. The decreased myosin heavy chain (a muscle thick filament protein) and increased FOXO3A and Atrogin-1 (muscle atrophy-related proteins) protein expressions in soleus muscles of HF diet-fed rats could also be reversed by FO substitution. FO substitution could also significantly activate adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), and PPARγ protein expression and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA expression in soleus muscles of HF diet-fed rats. These results suggest that substitution of FO exerts a beneficial improvement in the imbalance of lipid and muscle metabolisms in obesity. AMPK/PGC-1α signaling may play an important role in FO-prevented obesity-induced muscle wasting."
0,"CD59 is a complement regulatory protein that inhibits the formation of membrane attack complex of complement. In this study, we examined the expression and activity of tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) CD59 (CsCD59). CsCD59 possesses the conserved structural features of CD59 and shares 33%-46% sequence identities with other fish CD59. Expression of CsCD59 was high in liver, spleen, and muscle, and was stimulated by infection of bacterial pathogens. Recombinant CsCD59 (rCsCD59) exhibited an apparent inhibition effect on the activation of tongue sole serum complement. ELISA and microscopy detected binding of rCsCD59 to a number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Interaction with rCsCD59 did not affect bacterial viability but significantly enhanced bacterial resistance against the killing effect of fish serum. Together these results indicate that fish CD59 may to some degrees facilitate a general escape of bacteria from complement-mediated immunity."
0,"This study developed and characterized anti-fish monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) capable of detecting fish, a major allergenic food, in processed food products to protect fish sensitized individuals. Of the three mAbs raised against crude protein extract of cooked fish muscle, mAb 8F5 exhibited a positive reaction to all 50 common food fish species tested with no cross-reactions to shellfish, land animals, or food additives. Although the ELISA results were negative against swordfish and yellowfin tuna, western blot clearly detected both after cooking. The ~36 kDa antigenic protein of mAb 8F5, which was found in all fish species, was detectable by mAb 8F5 in all of the fish samples even after prolonged heat treatment (100 °C, up to 60 min). These findings suggest that mAb 8F5 has great potential utility as a probe for the immunochemical detection of fish tissue in cooked food."
0,"This study investigates the properties of films made from fish myofibrillar protein (FMP) incorporated with combinations of catechin-Kradon extract (C/K) (20%, w/w) at different ratios. The experimental films were compared to a polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The thickness and the transparency of the films were in the range of 0.014-0.015mm and 3.65-3.77, respectively. Significant decreases were observed in elongation at break (35-122%), water vapor permeability (0.54-1.26×10<sup>-10</sup>gm<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>Pa<sup>-1</sup>) properties, and a gradual decrease in L* value was pronounced when the proportions of catechins were increased (P<0.05). FMP films incorporated with C/K demonstrated to have very good barrier properties to UV light and also enhanced the thermal stability of the developed FMP films. All film samples had a smooth surface; however coarser surfaces were observed when the amounts of catechins were increased. Furthermore, the developed FMP films showed high antioxidant capability. However, no significant antimicrobial activity was observed in this film. It is determined that FMP films enriched with C/K can be used for food packaging, with particular potential for active packaging. However, as compared with the PVC, the FMP films need further development, especially in terms of their mechanical and water barrier properties."
0,"Several studies have compared molecular components between red and white skeletal muscles in mammals. However, mammalian skeletal muscles are composed of mixed types of muscle fibers. In the current study, we analyzed and compared the distributions of titin, lipid, phosphate ions, and fatty acid levels in red and white muscles using a fish model (<i>Tilapia</i>), which is rich in red and white muscles, and these are well separated. Oil-red O staining showed that red muscle had more-abundant lipids than did white muscle. A time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometric (TOF-SIMS) analysis revealed that red muscle possessed high levels of palmitic acid and oleic acid, but white muscle contained more phosphate ions. Moreover, elastica-van Gieson (EVG) and Mito-Tracker green FM staining showed that collagen and elastic fibers were highly, respectively, distributed in connective tissues and mitochondria in red muscle. An electron micrographic analysis indicated that red muscle had a relatively higher number of mitochondria and longer sarcomere lengths and Z-line widths, while myofibril diameters were thicker in white muscle. Myofibrillar proteins separated by SDS-PAGE showed that the major giant protein, titin, was highly expressed in white muscle than in red muscle. Furthermore, ratios of titin to myosin heavy chain (MHC) (titin/MHC) were about 1.3 times higher in white muscle than red muscle. We postulated that white muscle is fit for short and strong contractile performance due to high levels of titin and condensed sarcomeres, whereas red muscle is fit for low intensity and long-lasting activity due to high levels of lipids and mitochondria and long sarcomeres."
0,"Fish protein isolates (FPI) were recovered from catfish heads and frames by alkaline extraction (AE) and salt extraction (SE) and made into surimi-like gels. Protein patterns and content, moisture, color, and texture of cooked protein gels were compared with commercial products. Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate poly acrylamide gel electrophoreses (SDS-PAGE) indicated that the integrity of major myofibrillar proteins was maintained during the extraction process, and the protein patterns were almost the same with that of the commercial surimi products. The yields of AE-FPI (heads: 36%; frames: 55%) were much higher (p < 0.05) than that of SE-FPI (heads: 9%; frames: 16%). Firmness of cooked protein gels made from heads was similar with that made from frames. Firmness of cooked protein gels made from FPI extracted by the SE method (heads: 0.45 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>; frames: 0.43 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that made from FPI extracted by the AE method (heads: 1.96 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>; frames: 1.85 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>)."
0,"Studies in rats suggest that fish proteins may improve lipid and glucose regulation and could thus be a potential tool in the treatment of obesity-related comorbidities. To date, all published rat studies on dietary fish protein have been designed with 50 or 100% of dietary proteins from fish. As it is not common, nor advised, to consume fish as the only protein source in a healthy diet, mechanistic studies on the effects of diets with low dose fish proteins are needed. Here, we investigate whether a low dose of cod protein would affect glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism in obese Zucker fa/fa rats."
1,Twelve male obese Zucker fa/fa rats consumed diets where cod proteins accounted for 25% of the total protein intake with the remaining 75% from casein (COD) or 100% of protein as casein (CAS) for 4 weeks.
2,"Rats fed COD achieved a higher body weight without affecting adiposity and thigh muscle mass after 4 weeks, but liver weight and hepatic cholesterol level were higher than in CAS-fed rats. Fasting serum level of non-esterified fatty acids and 2 h postprandial glucose level were lower in COD than in CAS. The fatty acid metabolism was beneficially affected by the COD diet, with e.g., higher ratio of n-3/n-6 PUFAs in serum, liver and adipose tissue when compared to CAS."
3,A low intake of cod protein (25% of protein intake) was sufficient to beneficially affect lipid metabolism and postprandial glucose regulation in obese fa/fa rats.
0,"The aims of this study were to identify a psychrotrophic bacterium, strain CR41, producing a cold adapted protease during growth at low temperatures and to evaluate the ability of the cells to hydrolyze hake fish protein. The strain was isolated from the intestinal tract of hake collected from the San Jorge Gulf (Patagonia, Argentina) and it was identified as Pseudoalteromonas. Growth and fish protein hydrolysis were determined using an aerated simple mineral medium plus 10% fish protein concentrate. Proteolytic activity was measured at 7 and 22 degrees C during culture in the concentrate. Protease production started in the exponential growth phase and reached a maximum during stationary phase. Protease activity at 7 degrees C was lower than at 22 degrees C. After 8 h of incubation, the percentage of hydrolyzed protein was 84% at 7 degrees C and 95% at 22 degrees C. Electrophoresis detection showed that degradation of muscle hake proteins was complete at both temperatures, and in gelatin zymograms extracellular activity showed two proteolytic bands with apparent molecular masses of approximately 31.6 and 62 kDa."
0,"The effects of nutrient and mechanical sensing on gut motility and intestinal metabolism in lower vertebrates remains largely unknown. Here we present the transcriptome response to luminal stimulation by nutrients and an inert bolus on nutrient response pathways and also the response on gut motility in a stomachless fish with a short digestive tract; the ballan wrasse (Labrus berggylta). Using an in vitro model, we differentiate how signals initiated by physical stretch (cellulose and plastic beads) and nutrients (lipid and protein) modulate the gut evacuation rate, motility patterns and the transcriptome. Intestinal stretch generated by inert cellulose initiated a faster evacuation of digesta out of the anterior intestine compared to digestible protein and lipid. Stretch on the intestine upregulated genes associated with increased muscle activity, whereas nutrients stimulated increased expression of several neuropeptides and receptors which are directly involved in gut motility regulation. Although administration of protein and lipid resulted in similar bulbous evacuation times, differences in intestinal motility, transit between the segments and gene expression between the two were observed. Lipid induced increased frequency of ripples and standing contraction in the middle section of the intestine compared to the protein group. We suggest that this difference in motility was modulated by factors [prepronociceptin (pnoca), prodynorphin (pdyn) and neuromedin U (nmu), opioid neurotransmitters and peptides] that are known to inhibit gastrointestinal motility and were upregulated by protein and not lipid. Our findings show that physical pressure in the intestine initiate contractions propelling the bolus distally, directly towards the exit, whereas the stimuli from nutrients modulates the motility to prolong the residence time of digesta in the digestive tract for optimal digestion."
0,"Myogenesis is a complex two-phase process of proliferation and differentiation, which seems to be greatly conserved in vertebrates. For the first time in fish, we identify the changes that occur in the proteome during this process in a gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) myocyte primary cell culture (on days 4, 8 and 12), using 2-D gel electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS. A significant increase of myogenin expression at day 8 marked the transition from proliferation to differentiation. Of the 898 spots in the proteome analysis, the 25 protein spots overexpressed on day 4 and the 15 protein spots overexpressed on day 8 indicate the end of proliferation and the beginning of differentiation, respectively. Proliferation was characterized by enrichment of proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton remodelling and in cellular metabolic processes (transcription, ubiquitination, response to stress and glucose metabolism). During differentiation, 41 proteins were overexpressed and 51 underexpressed; many of them related to biosynthetic processes (RNA and protein synthesis and folding, and pentose pathways), terminal myotube formation and muscle contraction. The main cellular processes of both phases of muscle development in fish are similar with those observed in mammals but extended in time, allowing sequential studies of myogenesis."
0,"Current guidelines tend to limit fish consumption based on mercury (Hg) or monomethylmercury (MeHg) content in fish flesh, without considering the presence of antagonist chemical elements that could modulate Hg toxicity. However, it is difficult to assess the potential for antagonistic interactions of these elements since their covariation within muscle tissues is poorly known. Here we present the first study simultaneously mapping multiple metal(oid)s (Hg, As and Se), lipids and proteins in fish fillets in order to assess the magnitude of intra-organ variability of metals and the potential for antagonistic interactions. We mapped two fish species (Striped Bass and Northern Pike) with contrasting muscular structure with respect to the presence of white, intermediate and red muscles. In individual Striped Bass muscle tissues, metals varied on average by 2.2-fold. Methylmercury and selenium covaried strongly and were related to protein content as assessed by % N; arsenic was inversely related to these elements and was associated with the lipid fraction of the muscle. In Pike, no such relationship was found because the contents in proteins and lipids were less variable. Arsenic speciation revealed that arsenobetaine and arsenolipids were the only As species in those fish species, whereas the toxic inorganic As species (As<sup>3+</sup>) was under the detection limit. Arsenobetaine was related to % N, whereas arsenolipids covaried with % lipids. Elemental associations found with muscle lipids and proteins could help explain changes in bioaccumulation patterns within and between individuals with potential implications on fish toxicology, biomonitoring and human consumption guidelines."
0,"The influence of lipid content and pretreatment methods (blanching and brining) on proteins conformation in fish (Capelin, <i>Mallotus</i> v<i>illosus</i>) during drying and smoking were assessed. Soluble protein fractions were examined through changes in salt-soluble proteins, sulfhydryl groups, and disulfide bonds contents. The salt level and moisture content were also evaluated. Conformational changes in muscle protein were significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) after blanching and during initial drying when moisture content and dryness rates were high. Salt-soluble proteins and total sulfhydryl groups contents reduced, whereas available sulfhydryl group and disulfide bonds contents intensified. The conformational changes were explained by muscle protein denaturation and aggregation ascribed to high temperature and dehydration during processing. The study reports fish protein denaturation to have reduced protein solubility as well as the nutritional value (loss of thermolabile compounds) and yield after smoking. More so, protein aggregation that was significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) higher in dried blanched fish could have reduced the dried fish sensory quality. Blanching pretreatment is thus not suitable for commercial capelin drying. Lipids were found to have protective effect against fish protein conformation."
0,"Moderate exercise enhances fish growth, although underlying physiological mechanisms are not fully known. Here we performed a proteomic and metabolic study in white (WM) and red (RM) muscle of gilthead sea bream juveniles swimming at 1.5 body lengths per second. Continuous swimming for four weeks enhanced fish growth without increasing food intake. Exercise affected muscle energy stores by decreasing lipid and glycogen contents in WM and RM, respectively. Protein synthesis capacity (RNA/protein), energy use (estimated by lipid-δ(13)C and glycogen-δ(13)C), and enzymatic aerobic capacity increased in WM, while protein turnover (expressed by δ(15)N-fractionation) did not change. RM showed no changes in any of these parameters. 2D-PAGE analysis showed that almost 15% of sarcoplasmic protein spots from WM and RM differed in response to exercise, most being over-expressed in WM and under-expressed in RM. Protein identification by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS and LC-MS/MS revealed exercise-induced enhancement of several pathways in WM (carbohydrate catabolism, protein synthesis, muscle contraction, and detoxification) and under-expression of others in RM (energy production, muscle contraction, and homeostatic processes). The mechanism underpinning the phenotypic response to exercise sheds light on the adaptive processes of fish muscles, being the sustained-moderate swimming induced in gilthead sea bream achieved mainly by WM, thus reducing the work load of RM and improving swimming performance and food conversion efficiency."
0,"Sarcoplasmic proteins from 3 fish species were fractionated by 50% to 70% ammonium sulfate precipitation. Lyophilized fractionated sarcoplasmic proteins of threadfin bream (TB-SP), bigeye snapper (BS-SP), and yellow croaker (YC-SP) showed 80% to 92% trypsin inhibitory activity. Trypsin inhibitory activity staining gel electrophoresis revealed bands at 32, 33, 37, 45, 48, and 50 kDa for the 3 species, and a band at 95 kDa was observed for TB-SP and YC-SP. Alpha-1-antitrypsin with molecular mass of 45 to 50 kDa was identified in YC-SP by gel-based liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS). Other major protein bands appeared on trypsin activity staining included phosphorylase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase with molecular mass of 95 and 35 to 40 kDa, respectively. But, these 3 proteins did not show true trypsin inhibitory activity. Trypsin inhibitory activity of fractionated sarcoplasmic proteins showed good stability, with >80% activity retained at 60 °C and up to 0.6 M NaCl. TB-SP showed the highest inhibitory activity against autolysis of washed threadfin bream mince at 65 °C. Addition of 0.5% or 1% TB-SP improved textural properties of threadfin bream surimi gels preincubated at 37 or 65 °C followed by heating at 90 °C. Therefore, TB-SP could be a promising protein ingredient for enhancing surimi gel texture."
1,"Threadfin bream, bigeye snapper, and yellow croaker are the main species used as raw material for tropical surimi production. Sarcoplasmic proteins from 3 species contain trypsin inhibitor(s) that can minimize proteolytic activity and improve gel texture of proteinase-laden fish muscle. Therefore, sarcoplasmic proteins that are byproducts from surimi processing of these species could be recovered, fractionated, and utilized as a functional protein ingredient."
0,"Fishes are increasingly used as models for human cardiac diseases, creating a need for a better understanding of the molecular basis of fish cardiac ion currents. To this end we cloned KCNH6 channel of the crucian carp (Carassius carassius) that produces the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (IKr), the main repolarising current of the fish heart. KCNH6 (ccErg2) was the main isoform of the Kv11 potassium channel family with relative transcript levels of 98.9% and 99.6% in crucian carp atrium and ventricle, respectively. KCNH2 (ccErg1), an orthologue to human cardiac Erg (Herg) channel, was only slightly expressed in the crucian carp heart. The native atrial IKr and the cloned ccErg2 were inhibited by similar concentrations of verapamil, terfenadine and KB-R7943 (P>0.05), while the atrial IKr was about an order of magnitude more sensitive to E-4031 than ccErg2 (P<0.05) suggesting that some accessory β-subunits may be involved. Sensitivity of the crucian carp atrial IKr to E-4031, terfenadine and KB-R7943 was similar to what has been reported for the Herg channel. In contrast, the sensitivity of the crucian carp IKr to verapamil was approximately 30 times higher than the previously reported values for the Herg current. In conclusion, the cardiac IKr is produced by non-orthologous gene products in fish (Erg2) and mammalian hearts (Erg1) and some marked differences exist in drug sensitivity between fish and mammalian Erg1/2 which need to be taken into account when using fish heart as a model for human heart.

0,"Proinflammatory cytokines play a key role in the pathophysiology of muscle atrophy. In addition, n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) exert an inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokines affecting many inflammatory diseases. We hypothesized that dietary supplementation of fish oil could attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced muscle atrophy. Weanling pigs were used in a 2 × 2 factorial design and the main factors included diet (5% corn oil or 5% fish oil) and immunological challenge (LPS or saline). After 21 d of treatment with either fish oil or corn oil, pigs received an i.p. injection of either saline or LPS. At 4 h postinjection, blood and muscle samples were obtained. Fish oil led to enrichment of eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and total n3 PUFAs in muscles. Fish oil increased muscle protein mass, indicated by a higher protein:DNA ratio in gastrocnemius and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles. In addition, fish oil increased Akt1 mRNA abundance and decreased Forkhead Box O (FOXO) 1 and FOXO4 mRNA abundance. Fish oil also increased phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO1 in gastrocnemius and LD muscles. Fish oil decreased the mRNA abundance of muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and muscle RING finger 1 in gastrocnemius and LD muscles. Moreover, fish oil reduced the plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, muscle TNFα, and prostaglandin E2 concentrations, and muscle TNFα and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) mRNA abundance. Finally, fish oil downregulated the mRNA abundance of muscle toll-like receptor (TLR4) and its downstream signaling molecules [myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), TNFα receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and NF-κB p65], and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein (NOD1), NOD2, and their adaptor molecule [receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2)]. These results indicate fish oil may suppress muscle proinflammatory cytokine production via regulation of TLR and NOD signaling pathways and therefore improve muscle protein mass, possibly through maintenance of Akt/FOXO signaling.

0,"Bacterial biofilm formation on inert surfaces is a significant health and economic problem in a wide range of environmental, industrial, and medical areas. Bacterial adhesion is generally a prerequisite for this colonization process and, thus, represents an attractive target for the development of biofilm-preventive measures. We have previously found that the preconditioning of several different inert materials with an aqueous fish muscle extract, composed primarily of fish muscle alpha-tropomyosin, significantly discourages bacterial attachment and adhesion to these surfaces. Here, this proteinaceous coating is characterized with regards to its biofilm-reducing properties by using a range of urinary tract infectious isolates with various pathogenic and adhesive properties. The antiadhesive coating significantly reduced or delayed biofilm formation by all these isolates under every condition examined. The biofilm-reducing activity did, however, vary depending on the substratum physicochemical characteristics and the environmental conditions studied. These data illustrate the importance of protein conditioning layers with respect to bacterial biofilm formation and suggest that antiadhesive proteins may offer an attractive measure for reducing or delaying biofilm-associated infections."
0,"The Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) is a regionally endothermic fish that maintains temperatures in their swimming musculature, eyes, brain and viscera above that of the ambient water. Within their skeletal muscle, a thermal gradient exists, with deep muscles, close to the backbone, operating at elevated temperatures compared to superficial muscles near the skin. Their heart, by contrast, operates at ambient temperature, which in bluefin tunas can range widely. Cardiac function in tunas reduces in cold waters, yet the heart must continue to supply blood for metabolically demanding endothermic tissues. Physiological studies indicate Pacific bluefin tuna have an elevated cardiac capacity and increased cold-tolerance compared to warm-water tuna species, primarily enabled by increased capacity for sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling within the cardiac muscles."
1,"Here, we compare tissue-specific gene-expression profiles of different cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues in Pacific bluefin tuna. There was little difference in the overall expression of calcium-cycling and cardiac contraction pathways between atrium and ventricle. However, expression of a key sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-cycling gene, SERCA2b, which plays a key role maintaining intracellular calcium stores, was higher in atrium than ventricle. Expression of genes involved in aerobic metabolism and cardiac contraction were higher in the ventricle than atrium. The two morphologically distinct tissues that derive the ventricle, spongy and compact myocardium, had near-identical levels of gene expression. More genes had higher expression in the cool, superficial muscle than in the warm, deep muscle in both the aerobic red muscle (slow-twitch) and anaerobic white muscle (fast-twitch), suggesting thermal compensation."
2,"We find evidence of widespread transcriptomic differences between the Pacific tuna ventricle and atrium, with potentially higher rates of calcium cycling in the atrium associated with the higher expression of SERCA2b compared to the ventricle. We find no evidence that genes associated with thermogenesis are upregulated in the deep, warm muscle compared to superficial, cool muscle. Heat generation may be enabled by by the high aerobic capacity of bluefin tuna red muscle."
0,"The present study assessed the influence of salinity and temperature on body growth and on muscle cellularity of Lophiosilurus alexaxdri vitelinic larvae. Slightly salted environments negatively influenced body growth of freshwater fish larvae and we observed that those conditions notably act as an environmental influencer on muscle growth and on local expression of hypertrophia and hypeplasia markers (IGFs and PCNA). Furthermore, we could see that salinity tolerance for NaCl 4gl(-)(1) diminishes with increasing temperature, evidenced by variation in body and muscle growth, and by irregular morphology of the lateral skeletal muscle of larvae. We saw that an increase of both PCNA and autocrine IGF-II are correlated to an increase in fibre numbers and fibre diameter as the temperature increases and salinity diminishes. On the other hand, autocrine IGF-I follows the opposite way to the other biological parameters assessed, increasing as salinity increases and temperature diminishes, showing that this protein did not participate in muscle cellularity, but participating in molecular/cellular repair. Therefore, slightly salted environments may provide adverse conditions that cause some obstacles to somatic growth of this species, suggesting some osmotic expenditure with a salinity increment. "
0,"The long term effects of fish oil (FO) substitution by increasing the levels of vegetable oils (VO), 0% (CTR), 50% (VO50) and 100% (VO100), in diets for Senegalese sole were evaluated in terms of skeletal muscle cellularity and expression of related genes. After 140 days of feeding, all fish had similar body weight and length. The inclusion of 50% VO did not result in differences in muscle cellularity, but dorsal muscle cross-sectional area and fast-twitch fibre diameter increased in fish fed total FO substitution, whilst fibre density was reduced (P < 0.05) in relation to CTR. The total number of fibres was similar in all treatments. FO substitution did not affect the transcript levels of myogenic genes (myf5, mrf4, myog, myod1, myod2), but resulted in a two-fold increase of fgf6 transcript levels compared to CTR (P < 0.05). The relative expression of igf-I was higher in VO100 than in VO50, but was similar to CTR. FO substitution resulted in cellularity changes related to the stimulation of muscle hypertrophic growth, but not hyperplastic growth, and associated with a nutritional modulation of fgf6 by dietary VO. This study indicates that 50% VO does not affect the muscle phenotype, but total FO substitution stimulates muscle hypertrophy."
0,"Although fish is an important part of the human diet, it is also a common source of food allergy. The major allergen in fish is parvalbumin, a well-conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein found in the white muscle of many fish species. Here, we studied the solution structure of the parvalbumin Sco j 1, derived from the Pacific mackerel, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We mapped the IgE-binding epitope proposed in a recent study onto the present structure. Interestingly, three of four residues, which were elucidated as key residues of the IgE-binding epitope, were exposed to solvent, whereas one residue faced the inside of the molecule. We expect that this solution structure can be used in future studies attempting to analyze the various IgE-binding modes of these allergens."
0,"Native peptides from sea bass muscle were analyzed by two different approaches: medium-sized peptides by peptidomics analysis, whereas short peptides by suspect screening analysis employing an inclusion list of exact m/z values of all possible amino acid combinations (from 2 up to 4). The method was also extended to common post-translational modifications potentially interesting in food analysis, as well as non-proteolytic aminoacyl derivatives, which are well-known taste-active building blocks in pseudo-peptides. The medium-sized peptides were identified by de novo and combination of de novo and spectra matching to a protein sequence database, with up to 4077 peptides (2725 modified) identified by database search and 2665 peptides (223 modified) identified by de novo only; 102 short peptide sequences were identified (with 12 modified ones), and most of them had multiple reported bioactivities. The method can be extended to any peptide mixture, either endogenous or by protein hydrolysis, from other food matrices."
0,"Oxygen-binding proteins, such as myoglobin, hemoglobin, neuroglobin, and cytoglobin, play a role in oxygen binding and delivery to tissues. In icefish, the loss of myoglobin and hemoglobin genes has been reported to be an adaptive evolution event. This interesting finding prompted us to exam oxygen-binding protein expression in diverse fish species. Taking advantage of substantial RNAseq data deposited in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database, we adopted a meta-transcriptomic approach to explore and compare four oxygen-binding protein gene expression levels in the skeletal muscle of 25 diverse fish species for the first time. RNAseq data were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database, and de novo assembly was performed to generate transcript contigs. The genes encoding oxygen-binding proteins were then identified by the BLAST search, and the relative expression level of oxygen-binding protein genes was normalized by the RPKM (Reads per Kilobase Million) method. By performing expression profiling, hierarchy clustering, and principal component analysis, pacu and loach fish were noticed by their high myoglobin expression levels in skeletal muscle tissues among 25 diverse fish species. In conclusion, we demonstrated that meta-transcriptomic analysis of RNAseq data is an informative approach to compare the oxygen-binding protein expression and putative gene expansion event in fish."
0,"The freshwater fish Anabas testudineus was exposed for 21 days to two commercial formulations of synthetic pyrethroids deltamethrin and permethrin at sublethal concentrations of 0.007 and 0.0007 mg L(-1), and 0.093 and 0.0093 mg L(-1), that represented 10% and 1%, respectively, of the 96 h LC50 of these two pesticides for this fish. The glycogen, protein and lactic acid contents, along with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme activities in liver and muscle tissues of control and pesticide-exposed fish were estimated. When compared with those of control fish, significant depletion of glycogen content was observed in liver, and that of protein in muscle tissue of fish treated with both the pesticides at their higher as well as lower concentrations. Lactic acid reduction was significant only in fish muscle treated with deltamethrin. SDH level was reduced significantly in both liver and muscle tissues except in fish exposed to 0.0093 mg L(-1) permethrin. AST level was reduced significantly in liver and muscle tissues and ALT in muscle tissue of deltamethrin treated fish only. It is concluded that deltamethrin, a type-II pyrethroid, is more toxic to fish than the type-I pyrethroid permethrin and is capable of rendering toxicity at a dose as low as 1% of its LC50 value."
0,"The use of stable isotope ratio analysis (SIRA) as a rapid analytical tool to characterize and discriminate farmed fish on the basis of the feedstuffs included in the diet formulation is discussed. Two isoproteic (44.8%) and isolipidic (19.6%) extruded diets were formulated: a fish-meal-based diet (FM diet), containing fish meal as the sole protein source; a plant-protein-based diet (PP diet), where pea protein concentrate and wheat gluten meal replaced 80% of fish meal protein. The diets were fed to eight groups of rainbow trout (initial body weight: 106.6g) for 103 days in two daily meals under controlled rearing conditions. Growth performance (final body weight: 318.5 g; specific growth rate: 1.06%) and feed-to-gain ratio (0.79) were not affected by the dietary treatment. The differences in isotopic values of the two diets were clearly reflected in the different carbon and nitrogen isotopic values in rainbow trout fillets. The delta(13)C and delta(15)N values of muscle of farmed rainbow trout showed differences between farmed fish fed a fish-protein-based diet (-20.47 +/- 0.34 and 12.38 +/- 0.57 for delta(13)C and delta(15)N, respectively) and those fed a plant-protein-based diet (-23.96 +/- 0.38 and 7.15 +/- 0.51 for delta(13)C and delta(15)N, respectively). The results suggest that SIRA provides a robust and verifiable analytical tool to discriminate between fish fed on a plant or a fish protein diet."
0,"The present study investigates if the total replacement of dietary fishmeal (FM) with poultry by-product meal (PBM), supplemented with methionine influences the muscle fatty acids composition, normal gut morphology, histological traits of the liver, muscle, and gill, liver enzymes, immune and antioxidant response, and stress-related gene in juvenile barramundi, Lates calcarifer in relation to growth and feed utilization. Barramundi (3.58±0.01g) were randomly distributed into six 300 L seawater recirculating tanks (25 fish/tank) and fed two formulated isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets for 6 weeks. The control diet had FM as the sole animal protein source, whereas other test diet had only PBM as an animal protein source. Dietary PBM affected the fish performance and feed utilization. Regarding muscle fatty acid profile, total saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids elevated while total PUFA particularly n-3 LC-PUFA and EPA decreased in PBM fed fish than control diet fed fish. Liver, muscle, gill, and intestinal histology showed no obvious alteration in control diet fed fish, however, more lipid droplets and hepatic vacuolization in the liver, necrotic myotome in muscle, hyperplasia in secondary lamellae in gill and short and broken folds in the intestine were observed in PBM fed fish. Similar to light microscopy observation of intestinal morphology, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed shorter and smaller microvilli in fish fed PBM. Histopathological alterations in the liver of PBM fed fish were further associated with the elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and the significant upregulation of stress-related genes, HSP70 and HSP90. Also, a negative influence on lysozyme activity, and antioxidant enzymatic activities were recorded in fish fed PBM. Overall, it can be concluded that a total substitution of FM protein by methionine supplemented PBM negatively influenced the growth performance, liver health, histological traits of different organs, immune and antioxidant response, and expression of stress-related genes in juvenile barramundi."
0,"The biosynthesis and activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) requires accessory proteins. In mammals, a number of accessory proteins have been characterized, that can be classified based on their function as ligand-recognition and delivery cofactors, chaperones and trafficking proteins. We identified the homologs in teleost fish genomes of mammalian accessory molecules and show their expression in transcriptome data sets. Further, we annotate in detail TLR4 interactor with leucine-rich repeats (tril) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and in common carp (Cyprinus carpio). In mammals, TRIL is a functional component of the TLR4 complex and is important for TLR3 signaling, and is mainly expressed in the brain. In fish, the Tril molecule has many conserved features of mouse and human TRIL, containing 13 leucine-rich repeat domains, a fibronectin and a transmembrane domain. Zebrafish tril could not be detected in the latest assembly of the zebrafish genome (Zv9) and required manual annotation based on genome and transcriptome shotgun sequencing data sets. Carp tril was found in two copies in the draft genome. Both copies of carp tril are constitutively expressed in several organs, with the highest gene expression in muscle, skin and brain. In carp, the tril gene is expressed at high levels in endothelial cells and thrombocytes. We discuss the implication of the presence of most, but not all, accessory molecules for the biosynthesis and activation of tlr molecules in fish. "
0,"Fish discards are of major concern in new EU policies. Alternatives for the management of the new biomass that has to be landed is compulsory. The production of bioactive compounds from fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) has been explored in recent years. However, the viability of <i>Scyliorhinus canicula</i> discards, which might account for up to 90-100% of captures in mixed trawler, gillnet, and longline industrial fisheries, to produce FPH from the muscle with bioactivities has still not been studied in terms of the optimization of the experimental conditions to enhance its production. The effect of <i>pH</i> and temperature on the hydrolysis of the <i>S.</i><i>canicula</i> muscle was mediated by three commercial proteases using response surface methodology. Temperatures of 64.6 °C and 60.8 °C and pHs of 9.40 and 8.90 were established as the best hydrolysis conditions for Alcalase and Esperase, respectively. Optimization of the best conditions for the maximization of antihypertensive and antioxidant activities was performed. Higher Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was found with Esperase. The <i>pH</i> optimum and temperature optimum for antioxidants were 55 °C/pH8.0 for ABTS/DPPH-Esperase, 63.1 °C/pH9.0 for DPPH-Alcalase, and 55 °C/pH9.0 for ABTS-Alcalase. No hydrolysis was detected when using Protamex."
0,"The quality of fish flesh depends on the skeletal muscle's energetic state and delaying energy depletion through diets supplementation could contribute to the preservation of muscle's quality traits and modulation of fish allergens. Food allergies represent a serious public health problem worldwide with fish being one of the top eight more allergenic foods. Parvalbumins, have been identified as the main fish allergen. In this study, we attempted to produce a low allergenic farmed fish with improved muscle quality in controlled artificial conditions by supplementing a commercial fish diet with different creatine percentages. The supplementation of fish diets with specific nutrients, aimed at reducing the expression of parvalbumin, can be considered of higher interest and beneficial in terms of food safety and human health. The effects of these supplemented diets on fish growth, physiological stress, fish muscle status, and parvalbumin modulation were investigated. Data from zootechnical parameters were used to evaluate fish growth, food conversion ratios and hepatosomatic index. Physiological stress responses were assessed by measuring cortisol releases and muscle quality analyzed by <i>rigor mortis</i> and pH. Parvalbumin, creatine, and glycogen concentrations in muscle were also determined. Comparative proteomics was used to look into changes in muscle and liver tissues at protein level. Our results suggest that the supplementation of commercial fish diets with creatine does not affect farmed fish productivity parameters, or either muscle quality. Additionally, the effect of higher concentrations of creatine supplementation revealed a minor influence in fish physiological welfare. Differences at the proteome level were detected among fish fed with different diets. Differential muscle proteins expression was identified as tropomyosins, beta enolase, and creatine kinase among others, whether in liver several proteins involved in the immune system, cellular processes, stress, and inflammation response were modulated. Regarding parvalbumin modulation, the tested creatine percentages added to the commercial diet had also no effect in the expression of this protein. The use of proteomics tools showed to be sensitive to infer about changes of the underlying molecular mechanisms regarding fish responses to external stimulus, providing a holistic and unbiased view on fish allergens and muscle quality."
0,"Fish cannot use carbohydrate efficiently and instead utilize protein for energy supply, thus limiting dietary protein storage. Protein deposition is dependent on protein turnover balance, which correlates tightly with cellular energy homeostasis. Mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) plays a crucial role in energy metabolism. However, the effect of remodeled energy homeostasis caused by inhibited mitochondrial FAO on protein deposition in fish has not been intensively studied."

2,"Carnitine-depleted male Nile tilapia (initial weight: 4.29 ± 0.12 g; 3 mo old) were established by feeding them with mildronate diets (1000 mg/kg/d) for 6 wk. Zebrafish deficient in the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b gene (cpt1b) were produced by using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology, and their males (154 ± 3.52 mg; 3 mo old) were used for experiments. Normal Nile tilapia and wildtype zebrafish were used as controls. We assessed nutrient metabolism and energy homeostasis-related biochemical and molecular parameters, and performed 14C-labeled nutrient tracking and transcriptomic analyses."
3,"The mitochondrial FAO decreased by 33.1-88.9% (liver) and 55.6-68.8% (muscle) in carnitine-depleted Nile tilapia and cpt1b-deficient zebrafish compared with their controls (P < 0.05). Notably, glucose oxidation and muscle protein deposition increased by 20.5-24.4% and 6.40-8.54%, respectively, in the 2 fish models compared with their corresponding controls (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase/protein kinase B-mechanistic target of rapamycin (AMPK/AKT-mTOR) signaling was significantly activated in the 2 fish models with inhibited mitochondrial FAO (P < 0.05)."
4,"These data show that inhibited mitochondrial FAO in fish induces energy homeostasis remodeling and enhances glucose utilization and protein deposition. Therefore, fish with inhibited mitochondrial FAO could have high potential to utilize carbohydrate. Our results demonstrate a potentially new approach for increasing protein deposition through energy homeostasis regulation in cultured animals."
0,"Obesity increases the risk for developing kidney disease, and protection of kidneys through changes in diet should be investigated. Fish intake has been associated with reduced risk of developing kidney disease; therefore, we wanted to investigate whether cod protein intake could prevent or delay the development of kidney damage in an obese rat model that spontaneously develops proteinuria and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The aim of the study was to investigate any effects of cod protein intake on established markers of kidney function, amino acid composition, protein utilisation and growth in obese Zucker fa/fa rats in the early stage of decreased renal function. Male obese Zucker fa/fa rats (HsdOla:Zucker-Lepr) were fed cod muscle proteins in an amount corresponding to 25 % of dietary protein, with the remaining protein from a casein/whey mixture (COD diet). A control group was fed a diet with a casein/whey mixture as the only protein source (CAS diet). The intervention started when rats were 9-10 weeks old, and the rats were fed these diets for 4 weeks. At the end of the study, rats fed the COD diet had lower urine concentration of cystatin C, T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-1 (TIM-1), amino acids, carbamide, uric acid and ammonium and higher concentrations of creatine, trimethylamine N-oxide, 1-methylhistidine and 3-methylhistidine, lower kidney concentration of TIM-1 and showed better growth when compared with the CAS group. To conclude, cod protein may have the potential to delay the development of kidney damage in young obese Zucker rats and to improve protein utilisation and growth."
0,"Type I collagen is proven to make an important contribution to fish muscle quality. Our previous study has shown the Smad4-dependent regulation of type I collagen expression in the muscle of crisp grass carp fed with faba bean. However, the regulatory roles of TGF-β1 or TGF-β1/Smad4 on type I collagen remain unclear in ordinary grass carp fed with normal diets or in other fish species. To clarify this point, the effect of TGF-β1 and Smad4 over-expression and RNAi knockdown on type I collagen (COL1-α1 and COL1-α2) expression were tested in vitro (zebrafish ZF4 cells) and in vivo (grass carp) along with the TGF-β1/Smad4 co-expression and co-knockdown. The mRNA levels of TGF-β1, Smad4, and type I collagen were upregulated in the groups with over-expressed TGF-β1 and Smad4 and downregulated in the groups of TGF-β1 and Smad4 RNAi in comparison to controls in vitro (P < 0.05). Similarly, in the in vivo experiment, the mRNA abundance of TGF-β1, Smad4, and type I collagen of over-expression group was higher than the controls at 36 h (P < 0.05). Co-injection of TGF-β1/Smad4 over-expression and RNAi vectors generally showed the higher efficacy. This study revealed that TGF-β1 and Smad4 genes regulated type I collagen expression in grass carp muscle and zebrafish. These findings will provide references for the collagen regulation of other freshwater fishes."
0,"Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha (IKKα) plays a pivotal role in the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway in response to pathogens infections in mammals, but the information about IKKα in the regulation of immune responses is still limited in teleost fishes. In the present study, the full-length cDNA of an IKKα homologue, AjIKKα, was cloned by 5' and 3' SMART RACE from Japanese eel, and its characteristics of expression in response to various PAMPs and A. hydrophila infection were investigated both in vivo and in vitro using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In addition, the subcellular localization of AjIKKα GFP fusion protein and the induction of AjIKKα in the activation of NF-κB, type I IFN and AP1 performed using Dual-Glo luciferase assay system were also detected. Sequence comparison analysis revealed that AjIKKα has typical conserved domains, including an N-terminal kinase domain, an ubiquitin-like domain, a scaffold dimerization domain, and a C-terminal NEMO-binding domain. The predicted three-dimensional structure of AjIKKα is similar to that of human IKKα. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed a broad expression for AjIKKα in a wide range of tissues, with the highest expression in the liver, followed by the intestine, gills, and spleen, and with a lower expression in the muscle and heart. The AjIKKα expressions in the liver and kidney were significantly induced following injection with the viral mimic poly I:C and Aeromonas hydrophila infection, whereas the bacterial mimic LPS down-regulated the expression of AjIKKα in the spleen. In vitro, the AjIKKα transcripts of Japanese eel liver cells were significantly enhanced by the treatment of LPS, poly I:C, CpG-DNA, and PGN or the stimulation of different concentration of Aeromonas hydrophila (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cfu/mL, 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/mL, and 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> cfu/mL). Luciferase assays demonstrated that AjIKKα expression could significantly induce NF-κB, AP-1 and type I IFN promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, subcellular localization studies showed that AjIKKα was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm in the natural state, but AjIKKα was found to aggregate into spots in the cytoplasm after the stimulation of LPS and poly I:C. These results collectively indicated that AjIKKα plays an important role in innate immunity of host against antibacterial and antiviral infection likely via the activation of NF-κB, AP1and type I IFN signaling pathway."
0,"Although protein degradation limits the rate of muscle growth in fish, the role of proteolytic systems responsible for degrading myofibrillar proteins in skeletal muscle is not well defined. The study herein aims to evaluate the role of calpains (calcium-activated proteases) and proteasomes (ATP-dependent proteases) in mediating muscle protein turnover at different life stages in wild salmonids. Protease activities were estimated in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) parr and smolts from the Indera River (Kola Peninsula, Russia). Calpain and proteasome activities in Atlantic salmon skeletal muscles were lower in smolts as compared with parr. Reduced muscle protein degradation accompanying Atlantic salmon parr-smolt transformation appeared to provide intense muscle growth essential for a minimum threshold size achievement that is required for smoltification. Calpain and proteasome activities in brown trout parr and smolts at age 3+ did not significantly differ. However, calpain activity was higher in smolts brown trout 4+ as compared with parr, while proteasome activity was lower. Results suggest that brown trout smoltification does not correspond with intense muscle growth and is more facultative and plastic in comparison with Atlantic salmon smoltification. Obtained data on muscle protein degradation capacity as well as length-weight parameters of fish reflect differences between salmon and trout in growth and smoltification strategies."
0,"In the present study, we characterized tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2/7 (lcTRAF2/7) and TNFR1-associated death domain protein (lcTRADD) in Larimichthys crocea (L. crocea) and examined their expression profiles in tissues of Vibrio-challenged and unchallenged fish. The coding sequences of lcTRAF2, lcTRAF7, and lcTRADD were 1488, 2454, and 744 nucleotides, and they encoded proteins of 495, 344, and 248 amino acids, respectively. The results of phylogenetic analysis revealed that lcTRAF2, lcTRAF7, and lcTRADD were closest to Oplegnathus fasciatus (85%), Xiphophorus maculatus (97%), and Acanthochromis polyacanthus (65%), respectively. Multiple sequence alignment showed that lcTRAF2 and lcTRAF7 were highly conserved with other vertebrate TRAFs in their functional domains; however, lcTRADD was poorly conserved. The results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that lcTRAF2, lcTRAF7, and lcTRADD were constitutively expressed in the spleen, liver, kidney, heart, brain, gill, bladder, skin, fin, eye, and muscle. After challenging fish with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the mRNA expression levels of lcTRAF2, lcTRAF7, and lcTRADD were upregulated in liver, spleen, and kidney. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that lcTRAF2 and lcTRADD were cytoplasmic in localization, whereas lcTRAF7 targeted both the cytoplasm and nucleus. In addition, the NF-κB protein level was upregulated after lipopolysaccharide stimulation in lcTRAF2, lcTRAF7, or lcTRADD overexpressing cells. Taken collectively, these results have improved our understanding of the functions of TRAF2, TRAF7, and TRADD in pathogenic infections in teleosts."
0,"The red cusk-eel (Genypterus chilensis) is a native species with strong potential to support Chilean aquaculture diversification. Environmental stressors, such as temperature, may generate important effects in fish physiology with negative impact. However, no information exists on the effects of thermal stress in Genypterus species or how this stressor affects the skeletal muscle. The present study evaluated for the first time the effect of high temperature stress in red cusk-eel juveniles to determine changes in plasmatic markers of stress (cortisol, glucose and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)), the transcriptional effect in skeletal muscle genes related to (i) heat shock protein response (hsp60 and hsp70), (ii) muscle atrophy and growth (foxo1, foxo3, fbxo32, murf-1, myod1 and ddit4), and (iii) oxidative stress (cat, sod1 and gpx1), and evaluate the DNA damage (AP sites) and peroxidative damage (lipid peroxidation (HNE proteins)) in this tissue. Thermal stress generates a significant increase in plasmatic levels of cortisol, glucose and LDH activity and induced heat shock protein transcripts in muscle. We also observed an upregulation of atrophy-related genes (foxo1, foxo3 and fbxo32) and a significant modulation of growth-related genes (myod1 and ddit4). Thermal stress induced oxidative stress in skeletal muscle, as represented by the upregulation of antioxidant genes (cat and sod1) and a significant increase in DNA damage and lipid peroxidation. The present study provides the first physiological and molecular information of the effects of thermal stress on skeletal muscle in a Genypterus species, which should be considered in a climate change scenario."
0,"Methionine is a limiting essential amino acid in most plant-based ingredients of fish feed. In the present study, we aimed to determine the effect of dietary methionine concentrations on several main factors involved in the regulation of mRNA translation and the two major proteolytic pathways (ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal) in the white muscle of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The fish were fed for 6 weeks one of the three isonitrogenous diets providing three different methionine concentrations (deficient (DEF), adequate (ADQ) and excess (EXC)). At the end of the experiment, the fish fed the DEF diet had a significantly lower body weight and feed efficiency compared with those fed the EXC and ADQ diets. This reduction in the growth of fish fed the DEF diet was accompanied by a decrease in the activation of the translation initiation factors ribosomal protein S6 and eIF2α. The levels of the main autophagy-related markers (LC3-II and beclin 1) as well as the expression of several autophagy genes (atg4b, atg12 l, Uvrag, SQSTM1, Mul1 and Bnip3) were higher in the white muscle of fish fed the DEF diet. Similarly, the mRNA levels of several proteasome-related genes (Fbx32, MuRF2, MuRF3, ZNF216 and Trim32) were significantly up-regulated by methionine limitation. Together, these results extend our understanding of mechanisms regulating the reduction of muscle growth induced by dietary methionine deficiency, providing valuable information on the biomarkers of the effects of low-fishmeal diets."
0,"Soccer players often experience eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage given the physical demands of soccer match-play. Since long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) enhance muscle sensitivity to protein supplementation, dietary supplementation with a combination of fish oil-derived n-3PUFA, protein, and carbohydrate may promote exercise recovery. This study examined the influence of adding n-3PUFA to a whey protein, leucine, and carbohydrate containing beverage over a six-week supplementation period on physiological markers of recovery measured over three days following eccentric exercise. Competitive soccer players were assigned to one of three conditions (2 × 200 mL): a fish oil supplement beverage (FO; n = 10) that contained n-3PUFA (1100 mg DHA/EPA-approximately 550 mg DHA, 550 mg EPA), whey protein (15 g), leucine (1.8 g), and carbohydrate (20 g); a protein supplement beverage (PRO; n = 10) that contained whey protein (15 g), leucine (1.8 g), and carbohydrate (20 g); and a carbohydrate supplement beverage (CHO; n = 10) that contained carbohydrate (24 g). Eccentric exercise consisted of unilateral knee extension/flexion contractions on both legs separately. Maximal force production was impaired by 22% during the 72-hour recovery period following eccentric exercise (p < 0.05). Muscle soreness, expressed as area under the curve (AUC) during 72-hour recovery, was less in FO (1948 ± 1091 mm × 72 h) than PRO (4640 ± 2654 mm × 72 h, p < 0.05) and CHO (4495 ± 1853 mm × 72 h, p = 0.10). Blood concentrations of creatine kinase, expressed as AUC, were ~60% lower in FO compared to CHO (p < 0.05) and tended to be lower (~39%, p = 0.07) than PRO. No differences in muscle function, soccer performance, or blood c-reactive protein concentrations were observed between groups. In conclusion, the addition of n-3PUFA to a beverage containing whey protein, leucine, and carbohydrate ameliorates the increase in muscle soreness and blood concentrations of creatine kinase following eccentric exercise in competitive soccer players."
0,"The congeneric freshwater fish Squalius carolitertii and S. torgalensis inhabit different Iberian regions with distinct climates; Atlantic in the North and Mediterranean in the South, respectively. While northern regions present mild temperatures, fish in southern regions often experience harsh temperatures and droughts. Previous work with two hsp70 genes suggested that S. torgalensis is better adapted to harsher thermal conditions than S. carolitertii as a result of the different environmental conditions. We present a transcriptomic characterisation of these species' thermal stress responses. Through differential gene expression analysis of the recently available transcriptomes of these two endemic fish species, comprising 12 RNA-seq libraries from three tissues (skeletal muscle, liver and fins) of fish exposed to control (18 °C) and test (30 °C) conditions, we intend to lay the foundations for further studies on the effects of temperature given predicted climate changes. Results showed that S. carolitertii had more upregulated genes, many of which are involved in transcription regulation, whereas S. torgalensis had more downregulated genes, particularly those responsible for cell division and growth. However, both species displayed increased gene expression of many hsps genes, suggesting that they are able to deal with protein damage caused by heat, though with a greater response in S. torgalensis. Together, our results suggest that S. torgalensis may have an energy saving strategy during short periods of high temperatures, re-allocating resources from growth to stress response mechanisms. In contrast, S. carolitertii regulates its metabolism by increasing the expression of genes involved in transcription and promoting the stress response, probably to maintain homoeostasis. Additionally, we indicate a set of potential target genes for further studies that may be particularly suited to monitoring the responses of Cyprinidae to changing temperatures, particularly for species living in similar conditions in the Mediterranean Peninsulas."
0,"We followed the progression of healing of deep excisional biopsy punch wounds over the course of 365 days in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by monitoring visual wound healing and gene expression in the healing muscle at regular intervals (1, 3, 7, 14, 38 and 100 days post-wounding). In addition, we performed muscle texture analysis one year after wound infliction. The selected genes have all previously been investigated in relation to vertebrate wound healing, but only few specifically in fish. The selected genes were interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and -β3, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -9 and -13, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), fibronectin (FN), tenascin-C (TN-C), prolyl 4-hydroxylase α1-chain (P4Hα1), lysyl oxidase (LOX), collagen type I α1-chain (ColIα1), CD41 and CD163. Wound healing progressed slowly in the presented study, which is at least partially due to the low temperature of about 8.5 °C during the first 100 days. The inflammation phase lasted more than 14 days, and the genes relating to production and remodeling of new extracellular matrix (ECM) exhibited a delayed but prolonged upregulation starting 1-2 weeks post-wounding and lasting until at least 100 days post-wounding. The gene expression patterns and histology reveal limited capacity for muscle regeneration in rainbow trout, and muscle texture analyses one year after wound infliction confirm that wounds heal with fibrosis. At 100 dpw epidermis had fully regenerated, and dermis partially regenerated. Scales had not regenerated even after one year. CD163 is a marker of ""wound healing""-type M2c macrophages in mammals. M2 macrophage markers are as yet poorly described in fish. The pattern of CD163 expression in the present study is consistent with the expected timing of presence of M2c macrophages in the wound. CD163 may thus potentially prove a valuable marker of M2 macrophages - or a subset hereof - in fish. We subjected a group of fish to bathing in an immunomodulatory β-glucan product during wound healing, but found this to have very limited effect on wound healing in contrast to a previously published study on common carp.

0,"The physiological role of leptin in fish is not fully elucidated. In the present study, the involvement of the leptin system in lipid deposition and mobilization in rainbow trout during feeding and 1, 2 and 4 weeks of fasting was investigated in two lines of rainbow trout with different muscle and visceral adiposity: a fat line (FL) with high total energy reserves, high muscle adiposity, but low visceral adiposity and a lean line (LL) with lower total energy reserves and lower muscle adiposity, but higher visceral adiposity. During 4 weeks of fasting, muscle lipids decreased by 63 % in the FL fish, while no such energy mobilization from muscle occurred in the LL fish. On the other hand, lipid stores in liver and visceral adipose tissue was utilized to a similar extent by the two fish lines during fasting. Under normal feeding conditions, plasma leptin levels were higher in the LL than the FL fish, suggesting a possible contribution of visceral adipocytes to plasma leptin levels. Plasma leptin-binding protein levels did not differ between the lines and were not affected by fasting. After 4 weeks of fasting, the long leptin receptor and the leptin-binding protein isoforms 1 and 3 muscle expression increased in the LL fish, as well as hepatic expression of leptin A1 and the two binding protein isoforms. These responses were not seen in the FL fish. The data suggest that the Lep system in rainbow trout is involved in regulation of energy stores and their mobilization."
0,"Alternagin-C (ALT-C) is a disintegrin-like peptide purified from Rhinocerophis alternatus snake venom with the property of inducing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and angiogenesis. Therefore, this protein could be interesting as a new approach for ischemic heart diseases, an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, leading to cardiac dysfunction. We investigated the effects of a single dose of alternagin-C (0.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, via intra-arterial), after 7 days, on hypoxia/reoxygenation challenge in isolated ventricle strips and on morphological changes and density of blood vessels of the heart, using fish as an alternative experimental model. ALT-C treatment provided protection of cardiomyocytes against hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced negative inotropism. ALT-C also stimulated angiogenesis and improved excitation-contraction coupling during hypoxic conditions. Our results provide a new insight into a functional role of ALT-C against hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cardiomyocyte injury pointing out to a potential therapeutic strategy for ischemia-related diseases."
0,"We examined the efficiency of electroporation for the delivery of plasmid into the skeletal muscle and also examined the subsequent secretion of recombinant protein into the circulation system, using zebrafish, Japanese flounder, and bubble-eye goldfish. The expression area of GFP fluorescence was markedly expanded by electroporation. Introduced plasmid was retained in the muscle cells and continued to express GFP for at least 180 days in zebrafish, indicating the long lifespan of plasmid DNA in the muscle cell. Luciferase and a fusion of growth hormone (GH) and luciferase were secreted into the blood from muscle electroporated with CMV:secNluc and CMV:GH-Luc plasmids, respectively, indicating that recombinant proteins such as peptide hormones can be supplied to the blood by plasmid electroporation into muscle. Interestingly, luciferase activity was detected from fertilized eggs laid by zebrafish females that had been electroporated with CMV:secNluc, indicating that maturing oocytes incorporated recombinant protein from the blood stream that had been secreted from the muscle. The plasmid electroporation system reported here also may work for the delivery of recombinant proteins, such as Cas9, into the oocytes. Since the GH-Luc fusion protein was detected in the lymph of the eye-sac of bubble-eye goldfish, this fish may be useful for the production of recombinant protein."
0,"Consisting of 25 to 30% of protein in carp, water-soluble sarcoplasmic proteins lost in wash water, have been recovered and freeze-dried into a protein-rich powder. Study objectives were to evaluate protein quality and safety of a silver carp sarcoplasm derived protein powder (CSP) compared to commercial protein supplements, casein, and whey. In vivo protein quality assessment of CSP showed a lower (P < 0.05) protein digestibility corrected amino acid score compared to the commercial protein sources. Despite greater (P < 0.05) fecal amino acid excretion in casein-fed rats, there were no significant differences in liver and muscle amino acid profiles. All low (10% kcal) protein diets supported growth with the normal range. However, whey protein supplementation resulted in greater (P < 0.05) adiposity. CSP, casein, or whey-fed rats showed no differences in major organ weights, renal damage biomarkers, or bone indices. Collectively, results indicated CSP was safe with protein quality comparable to casein. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: As much as 40 percent of protein in fish can be lost due to sarcoplasmic protein solubilization in processing wash water. Silver carp sarcoplasm protein powder may have similar commercial potential as a sustainable and nutritious alternative to whey and casein proteins. This project aimed to verify the protein quality and safety of this economical protein source."
0,"Peptide from croaker (Otolithes ruber) muscle protein hydrolysate was purified, characterized and evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity. Results showed that purified peptide contained the amino acid sequence as Lys-Thr-Phe-Cys-Gly-Arg-His (861.6Da), which were expected to contribute to its antioxidant activities. This peptide efficiently quenched 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radicals (84.5±1.2 and 62.4±2.9%), and successfully inhibits the lipid peroxidation and DNA damage and proven to be a potent antioxidant at different in vitro systems. It also improved the endogenous cellular antioxidant enzymes in Wistar rat by increasing the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) after supplementation of the peptide (283.6±7.25, 4.3±0.78 and 28.42±1.97) compared to the negative control (196.4±5.65, 1.3±0.45 and 15.1±0.35). Therefore, croaker muscle peptide can increase an endurance capacity and facilitate recovery from oxidative stress."
0,"The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release channel or ryanodine receptor (RyR) of the vertebrate heart is regulated by the FK506-binding proteins, FKBP12 and FKBP12.6. This study examines whether temperature-related changes in the SR function of fish hearts are associated with changes in FKBP12 expression. For this purpose, a polyclonal antibody against trout FKBP12 was used to compare FKPB12 expression in cold-acclimated (4 °C, CA) and warm-acclimated (18 °C, WA) rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), burbot (Lota lota) and crucian carp (Carassius carassius) hearts. FKBP12 expression was modulated in a species- and tissue-specific manner. Temperature acclimation affected FKBP12 expression only in atrial tissue. Changes in the ventricular FKBP12 expression were not detected in any of the fish species. In the atria of rainbow trout and crucian carp, temperature acclimation produced opposite thermal responses: FKBP12 increased in the trout atrium and decreased in the crucian carp atrium under cold acclimation. In the burbot heart, chronic temperature changes did not affect cardiac FKBP12 levels. Expression of FKBP12 mRNA in rainbow trout and crucian carp hearts suggests that the transcript levels are higher in the ventricle than in the atrium and are elevated by cold acclimation in trout, but not in crucian carp. Since FKBP12 is known to increase the Ca(2+) sensitivity of cardiac RyRs and thereby the opening frequency of the Ca(2+) release channels, temperature-related changes in FKBP12 expression may modify the SR function in excitation-contraction coupling. The cold-induced increase in FKBP12 in the trout atrium and decrease in the crucian carp atrium are consistent with the previously noted increase and decrease, respectively, of SR Ca(2+) stores in cardiac contraction in these species.

0,"The purpose of subject was to explore the optimum protein requirement of juvenile grouper (Epinephelus coioides). In the test, 450 juveniles with an average weight (10.02 ± 0.22) g were randomly divided into six groups with triplicate, and were fed with 350, 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600 g/kg iso-lipid test diet twice 1 day for 8 weeks, respectively. The results showed that: (1) With the increase of protein level, the body weight gain rate and specific growth rate first increased and then reduced, while the feed coefficient rate first decreased and then increased, while the protein efficiency significantly decreased (P < 0.05). (2) With the increase of protein level, the condition factor, hepaticsomatic index and visceralsomatic index significantly reduced (P < 0.05). (3) With the increase of protein level, the crude protein content of whole fish and muscle gradually increased, while the crude lipid content gradually decreased. (4) High-protein diet (550-600 g/kg) significantly increased the plasma total protein content and decreased the triglyceride content of orange-spotted grouper (P < 0.05). (5) Compared with the 350 g/kg group, 500, 550, 600 g/kg groups significantly increased the activities of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase in liver (P < 0.05). (6) With the increase of protein level, the protease activity of intestine first increased and then decreased, and reached the maximum at the protein level of 500 g/kg, while lipase and amylase decreased significantly (P < 0.05). (7) The activities of acid phosphatase, superoxide dismutase and lysozyme in liver increased first and then decreased with the increase of protein level, and reached the maximum in the 400 g/kg protein group. According to the analysis specific growth rate, the optimum protein level of juvenile orange-spotted grouper is 521.84 g/kg."
0,"Cardiac function is thought to play a central role in determining thermal optima and tolerance limits in teleost fishes. Investigating proteomic responses to temperature in cardiac tissues may provide insights into mechanisms supporting the thermal plasticity of cardiac function. Here, we utilized a global proteomic analysis to investigate changes in cardiac protein abundance in response to temperature acclimation (transfer from 13°C to 9, 19 and 26°C) in a eurythermal goby, Gillichthys mirabilis. Proteomic data revealed 122 differentially expressed proteins across acclimation groups, 37 of which were identified using tandem mass-spectrometry. These 37 proteins are involved in energy metabolism, mitochondrial regulation, iron homeostasis, cytoprotection against hypoxia, and cytoskeletal organization. Compared with the 9 and 26°C groups, proteins involved in energy metabolism increased in 19°C-acclimated fish, indicating an overall increase in the capacity for ATP production. Creatine kinase abundance increased in 9°C-acclimated fish, suggesting an important role for the phosphocreatine energy shuttle in cold-acclimated hearts. Both 9 and 26°C fish also increased abundance of hexosaminidase, a protein directly involved in post-hypoxia stress cytoprotection of cardiac tissues. Cytoskeletal restructuring appears to occur in all acclimation groups; however, the most prominent effect was detected in 26°C-acclimated fish, which exhibited significantly increased actin levels. Overall, proteomic analysis of cardiac tissue suggests that the capacity to adjust ATP-generating processes is crucial to the thermal plasticity of cardiac function. Furthermore, G. mirabilis may optimize cellular functions at temperatures near 19°C, which lies within the species' preferred temperature range."
0,"Several physiologically important genes were found to be regulated by hypoxia at the transcriptional level. The Pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 2 (PHLDA2) gene was previously identified as an imprinted gene. The present study was aimed to determine the structure of complete cDNA and the deduced protein of PHLDA2 along with analysing the changes in its mRNA expression in Clarias batrachus tissues under hypoxic conditions. The complete cDNA of CbPHLDA2 gene consisted of 1009 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 417 nucleotides. The deduced CbPHLDA2 protein of 139 amino acids shared high homology with PHLD2A of other fishes as well as that of vertebrates. Importantly, a single amino acid (asparagine/lysine) insertion was identified in the PH domain of CbPHLDA2 and other fishes, which was absent in other vertebrates studied. Furthermore, under normoxic conditions, CbPHLDA2 was constitutively expressed with varying levels in analysed tissues. Short- and long-term hypoxia exposure resulted in significant changes in the expression of CbPHLDA2 in liver, spleen, head kidney, brain and muscle in a time-dependent manner. The results suggested that CbPHLDA2 might play an important role for adaptive significance under hypoxia."
0,"Introduction: initial references of products made with surimi date back in Japan to the 12th century. The technological process was developed in 1972. It is essential to use fresh fish to preserve the nutritional and technological quality of its myofibrillar protein. The highest quality species for elaborating surimi is Alaska pollock, belonging to the cod family. The best part of the fish regarding quality are its fillets or loins. Objectives: to evaluate the protein quality of surimi and its omega-3 fatty acid content, and to review the scientific evidence for the role of surimi in relation to health. Results: the amino acid score pattern of surimi is above 100 for the 9 essential amino acids, showing good assimilation and digestibility, even higher than that of homologous products such as meat, fish, and eggs. Surimi contributes considerably to the intake of omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA). Different studies link surimi consumption with positive effects on body composition: increase in skeletal muscle and reduction in white adipose tissue, as well as a tendency to improved muscle motor function. EPA and DHA have a function on both cardiovascular and cognitive parameters. Conclusions: one of the main reasons to consume surimi is its excellent protein quality, highlighting its easy assimilation and digestibility. Likewise, surimi's natural content in omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA is of great nutritional interest. These components are related to functional effects on body composition, metabolic syndrome parameters, and cognitive level."
0,"Using fish serum albumin (FSA) as the model protein, molecular fluorescence spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were applied to study the effect of protein on the extraction of fluoroquinolone (FQ) residues in fish meat. There was a strong interaction between FQs and protein through hydrogen bonds, which could be broken as protein degenerated with 60-100% (v/v) acetonitrile acid solution, and FQs bound with protein were released in various degrees. On the basis of the results, a novel sample preparation procedure loosely based on QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) methodology was developed for the determination of FQ residues in fish muscle samples, using 90% (v/v) acetonitrile acid solution as the extractant, combined with a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) cleanup step. Mean recoveries of four FQs from spiked samples at a concentration range of 50-200 ng g(-1) were 73.3-95.9% with relative standard deviations (RSD) lower than 10.7%."
0,"For a comprehensive understanding of fish responses to increasing thermal stress in marine environments, we investigated tissue energetics, antioxidant levels, inflammatory and cell death responses in Sparus aurata (gilthead seabream) red muscle during exposure to elevated temperatures (24 °C, 26 °C, 30 °C) compared to the control temperature of 18 °C. Energetic aspects were assessed by determining lactate, glucose and lipids levels in blood plasma, ATP, ADP and AMP levels, and AMPK phosphorylation as an indicator of regulatory changes in energy metabolism, in tissue extracts. Oxidative defence was assessed by determining superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase maximum activities. Moreover, xanthine levels were determined as an indicator of purine conversion to xanthine and associated ROS production. In the context of inflammatory response and cell death due to oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IkBα phosphorylation, IL-6 and TNFα) levels, and LC3 II/I ratio and SQSTM1/p62 as indicators of autophagic-lysosomal pathway were also determined. A recovery in the efficacy of ATP production after a marked decrease during the 1st day of exposure to 24 °C is observed. This biphasic pattern is paralleled by antioxidant enzymes' activities and inflammatory and autophagy responses, indicating a close correlation between ATP turnover and stress responses, which may benefit tissue function and survival. However, exposure beyond 24 °C caused tissue's antioxidant capacity loss, triggering the inflammatory and cell death response, leading to increased fish mortality. The results of the present study set the thermal limits of the gilthead seabream at 22-24 °C and establish the used cellular and metabolic indicators as tools for the definition of the extreme thermal limits in marine organisms."
0,"Three types of egg white protein (regular dried egg white [REW], special dried egg white [SEW], and liquid egg white [LEW]) were compared for their effect in surimi (CON), containing no egg white (EW). They were characterized for enzyme inhibition and time of EW addition, either with cryoprotectants prior to freezing or during gel preparation, using Pacific whiting surimi. In addition, the setting (suwari) effect and fish protein-EW protein interactions (dynamic rheological properties, total sulfhydryl groups, and fracture gel analysis) were evaluated using Alaska pollock surimi. After 12 mo frozen storage, adding 2% and 3% SEW to Pacific whiting surimi during chopping significantly (P < 0.05) increased the force and deformation values compared to adding the respective EW before freezing. The highest (P < 0.05) force (175.2 g) and deformation (9.0 mm) values after 12 mo were obtained when 3% SEW was added during chopping. Enzyme autolysis showed that addition of 2% EW protein was effective at inhibiting enzyme activity. During setting, adding 2% SEW maintained force (1047.4 g) and deformation (17.9 mm) values similar (P > 0.05) to CON (1055.1 g; 19.3 mm) and significantly (P < 0.05) better than 2% REW (666.1 g; 15.6 mm). Texture results corresponded well to other data where 2% SEW showed the lowest total sulfhydryl groups (48.3 mole/10(5) g), and higher elastic modulus (G'), which suggests improved protein interaction for gel formation. Overall, the addition of 2% to 3% SEW improved gel textural properties of Pacific whiting and Alaska pollock fish protein."
0,"A main challenge preventing optimal use of protein isolated from unconventional raw materials (e.g., small pelagic fish and fish by-products) using the pH-shift method is the difficulty to remove enough heme-pigments. Here, the distribution of hemoglobin (Hb) in the different fractions formed during pH-shift processing was studied using Hb-fortified cod mince. Process modifications, additives and prewashing were then investigated to further facilitate Hb-removal. The alkaline pH-shift process version could remove considerably more Hb (77%) compared to the acidic version (37%) when proteins were precipitated at pH 5.5; most Hb was removed during dewatering. Protein precipitation at pH 6.5 improved total Hb removal up to 91% and 74% during alkaline and acid processing, respectively. Adding phytic acid to the first supernatant of the alkaline process version yielded 93% Hb removal. Combining one prewash with phytic acid at pH 5.5 followed by alkaline/acid pH-shift processing increased Hb removal up to 96/92%. "
0,"Observational studies provide evidence that a higher intake of protein from plant-based foods and certain animal-based foods is associated with a lower risk for type 2 diabetes. However, there are few distinguishable differences between the glucoregulatory qualities of the proteins in plant-based foods, and it is likely their numerous non-protein components (e.g., fibers and phytochemicals) that drive the relationship with type 2 diabetes risk reduction. Conversely, the glucoregulatory qualities of the proteins in animal-based foods are extremely divergent, with a higher intake of certain animal-based protein foods showing negative effects, and others showing neutral or positive effects on type 2 diabetes risk. Among the various types of animal-based protein foods, a higher intake of dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, cheese and whey protein) consistently shows a beneficial relationship with glucose regulation and/or type 2 diabetes risk reduction. Intervention studies provide evidence that dairy proteins have more potent effects on insulin and incretin secretion compared to other commonly consumed animal proteins. In addition to their protein components, such as insulinogenic amino acids and bioactive peptides, dairy products also contain a food matrix rich in calcium, magnesium, potassium, trans-palmitoleic fatty acids, and low-glycemic index sugars-all of which have been shown to have beneficial effects on aspects of glucose control, insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and/or type 2 diabetes risk. Furthermore, fermentation and fortification of dairy products with probiotics and vitamin D may improve a dairy product's glucoregulatory effects. "
0,"Soluble calcium-binding proteins (SCBPs) of invertebrates probably serve like their vertebrate counterpart-the parvalbumins-as soluble relaxing factors in muscles. Three SCBP isoforms (SCBP<sub>1-3</sub>) have been isolated and biochemically characterized in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris (Huch et al. in J Comp Physiol B 158:325-334, 1988). For SCBP<sub>2</sub>, we found two isoforms named SCBP<sub>2a/2b</sub>. Both of them together with SCBP<sub>3</sub> are present in the body wall muscle. In the gizzard solely, SCBP<sub>2b</sub> and no SCBP<sub>2a</sub> or SCBP<sub>3</sub> could be detected. The coding sequences of all three isoforms consist of 534 bp for 178 amino acids and contain four EF-hand motifs, of which the second EF-hands are truncated. Recombinant proteins show heat stability and a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mobility shift similar to the native proteins, indicating comparable calcium-binding properties. All three isoforms are encoded by three distinct and differentially expressed genes. The genes for SCBP<sub>2a</sub>, SCBP<sub>2b</sub>, and SCBP<sub>3</sub> are interrupted by only one intron, inserting at nearly the same positions. Northern blot analysis revealed two mRNA transcripts for SCBP<sub>2</sub> of approximately 1250 and 1500 kb and one transcript for SCBP<sub>3</sub> of approximately 1250 kb. SCBP mRNA was localized by fluorescent in situ hybridization in the body wall and the gizzard. The distribution of the staining intensities resembles that for the myosin ATPase activity and indicates a correlation between the amount of SCBP and speed of muscle contraction. In addition, SCBP mRNA was localized within the nervous tissue, the cerebral and subesophageal ganglia and the ventral nerve cord."
0,"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been reported to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in animal models of insulin resistance, but the involved mechanisms still remain unresolved. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fish oil (FO), a source of n-3 PUFAs, on obesity, insulin resistance and muscle mitochondrial function in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). C57Bl/6 male mice, 8 weeks old, were divided into four groups: control diet (C), high-fat diet (H), C+FO (CFO) and H+FO (HFO). FO was administered by oral gavage (2 g/kg b.w.), three times a week, starting 4 weeks before diet administration until the end of the experimental protocol. HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance associated with impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, as indicated by decreased oxygen consumption, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate (TCAi) contents (citrate, α-ketoglutarate, malate and oxaloacetate), oxidative phosphorylation protein content and mitochondrial biogenesis. These effects were associated with elevated reactive oxygen species production, decreased PGC1-a transcription and reduced Akt phosphorylation. The changes induced by the HFD were partially attenuated by FO, which decreased obesity and insulin resistance and increased mitochondrial function. In the H group, FO supplementation also improved oxygen consumption; increased TCAi content, and Akt and AMPK phosphorylation; and up-regulated mRNA expression of Gpat1, Pepck, catalase and mitochondrial proteins (Pgc1α, Pparα, Cpt1 and Ucp3). These results suggest that dietary FO attenuates the deleterious effects of the HFD (obesity and insulin resistance) by improving skeletal muscle mitochondrial function."
0,"This study aimed to examine the effects of dietary digested soybean protein (DSP) and taurine on bile acid (BA) level, lipase activity, lipid apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC), and growth performance of pompano (Trachinotus blochii). Five diets were formulated with fish meal (FM), defatted soybean meal (SBM), and the DSP as main dietary protein sources. The diets were denoted as follows: FMD (FM-based diet), SBMD (SBM-based diet), SBM+TD (SBM-based diet plus taurine), DSPD (DSP-based diet), and DSP+TD (DSP-based diet plus taurine). Fingerling pompano with an initial body weight (BW) of 21.4 g were stocked in 500-L tanks, with triplicate tanks per dietary treatment. For 8 weeks, the fish were hand-fed the experimental diets to apparent satiation twice daily. The results showed that the DSPD and DSP+TD groups had significantly higher final BW, weight gain, and specific growth rate, but lower feed conversion ratio, than the SBMD and SBM+TD groups, respectively (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in growth and feed performances between fish fed DSP+TD and FMD. The gallbladder and anterior intestinal BA levels, anterior intestinal lipase activity, and lipid and protein ADCs were markedly increased in fish fed DSPD and DSP+TD compared to those fed SBMD (P < 0.05), and no significant differences were detected between the DSP+TD and FMD groups. The findings of the present study suggested that dietary DSP inclusion with taurine supplementation might effectively improve lipid digestion and this contributed to growth enhancement in pompano fed a soybean protein-based diet."
0,"Among all organotin compounds , triphenyltin hydroxide (TPhTH) is widely used as fungicide and moluscicide in Brazil. However, the effects of TPhTH on the biochemical parameters of non-target organisms, such as fish, are little known. The aim of the present study is to assess the possible toxic effects of different concentrations of waterborne TPhTH on silver catfish belonging to species Rhamdia quelen. The fish were exposed to two different concentrations of TPhTH (1.08 and 1.70 µg/L as Sn) for 15 days and then compared to the control group (triplicate, n = 3). The antioxidant profile (catalase (CAT) and the glutathione S-transferase (GST)) and the oxidative stress parameters (TBARS-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and protein carbonyl (PC)) were set after the exposure to TPhTH. The TBARS level and the PC content increased in several organs of the Rhamdia quelen (brain, liver, muscle and gills) under the two concentrations of TPhTH in comparison to the control group. The CAT activity in the liver and gills has enhanced in all tested TPhTH concentrations. The GST activity increased in the brain, liver and muscle tissues under all the TPhTH concentrations. The significant changes in the biomarkers indicated that the investigated pesticide could have harmful effect on fish, in the field. However, these biomarkers were measured after the fish received doses lower than the recommended for use in agriculture."
0,"The present study explored the effects of thiamin on antioxidant capacity of juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian). In a 60-day feeding trial, a total of 1,050 juvenile Jian carp (8.20 ± 0.02 g) were fed graded levels of thiamin at 0.25, 0.48, 0.79, 1.06, 1.37, 1.63 and 2.65 mg thiamin kg(-1) diets. The results showed that malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in serum, hepatopancreas, intestine and muscle were significantly decreased with increasing dietary thiamin levels (P < 0.05). Conversely, the anti-superoxide anion capacity and anti-hydroxyl radical capacity in serum, hepatopancreas, intestine and muscle were the lowest in fish fed the thiamin-unsupplemented diet. Meanwhile, the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase, and the contents of glutathione in serum, hepatopancreas, intestine and muscle were enhanced with increasing dietary thiamin levels (P < 0.05). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum, hepatopancreas and intestine followed a similar trend as CAT (P < 0.05). However, SOD activity in muscle was not affected by dietary thiamin level (P > 0.05). The results indicated that thiamin could improve antioxidant defence and inhibit lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation of juvenile Jian carp. "
0,"Leucine-enriched protein (LEU-PRO) and long-chain (LC) n-3 (ω-3) PUFAs have each been proposed to improve muscle mass and function in older adults, whereas their combination may be more effective than either alone."
1,"The impact of LEU-PRO supplementation alone and combined with LC n-3 PUFAs on appendicular lean mass, strength, physical performance and myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) was investigated in older adults at risk of sarcopenia."
2,"This 24-wk, 3-arm parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 107 men and women aged ≥65 y with low muscle mass and/or strength. Twice daily, participants consumed a supplement containing either LEU-PRO (3 g leucine, 10 g protein; n = 38), LEU-PRO plus LC n-3 PUFAs (0.8 g EPA, 1.1 g DHA; LEU-PRO+n-3; n = 38), or an isoenergetic control (CON; n = 31). Appendicular lean mass, handgrip strength, leg strength, physical performance, and circulating metabolic and renal function markers were measured pre-, mid-, and postintervention. Integrated rates of MyoPS were assessed in a subcohort (n = 28)."
3,"Neither LEU-PRO nor LEU-PRO+n-3 supplementation affected appendicular lean mass, handgrip strength, knee extension strength, physical performance or MyoPS. However, isometric knee flexion peak torque (treatment effect: -7.1 Nm; 95% CI: -12.5, -1.8 Nm; P < 0.01) was lower postsupplementation in LEU-PRO+n-3 compared with CON. Serum triacylglycerol and total adiponectin concentrations were lower, and HOMA-IR was higher, in LEU-PRO+n-3 compared with CON postsupplementation (all P < 0.05). Estimated glomerular filtration rate was higher and cystatin c was lower in LEU-PRO and LEU-PRO+n-3 postsupplementation compared with CON (all P < 0.05)."
4,"Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe a beneficial effect of LEU-PRO supplementation alone or combined with LC n-3 PUFA supplementation on appendicular lean mass, strength, physical performance or MyoPS in older adults at risk of sarcopenia. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03429491."
0,"Commonly used aquatic feed naturally contains low-level or no hydroxyproline (Hyp). This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary Hyp inclusion on growth performance, body composition, amino acid profiles, blood biochemistry, and the expression of target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway-related genes in juvenile Nibea diacanthus. Fish with similar size (initial body weight, 133.00 ± 2.14 g) were fed six isonitrogenous and isolipidic practical diets supplemented with graded levels of Hyp (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 g kg<sup>-1</sup> of dry matter) for 8 weeks. The results indicated that growth performance and feed utilization were improved with increased levels of dietary Hyp (P < 0.05), and the optimum amount of dietary Hyp estimated from SGR as 16.6 g kg<sup>-1</sup>. The crude protein of whole body and swim bladder and the amino acid composition of muscle and swim bladder were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by the addition of dietary Hyp, which reflects the important role of feed composition in animal body composition. In addition, the expression levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (TOR) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase1 (S6K1) genes in the liver, muscle, and swim bladder increased with increasing Hyp content of diets, while the mRNA expression level of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP) gene in these tissues decreased. These results indicated that Hyp improved fish growth and the ability to synthesize proteins, most likely through the TOR pathway. It is suggested that dietary Hyp supplementation is particularly necessary for application in aquatic feed."
0,"The goal of the study was to investigate the influence of pH and water hardness on protein contents of muscle tissues of Cirrhinus mrigala fingerlings by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. FT-IR spectra revealed significant differences in absorbance intensities between control and toxic metal-treated muscle tissues, reflecting a change in protein contents due to heavy metals, nickel and chromium, influence at different pH and water hardness. Metal toxicity is also more pronounced at pH 9.0 than in hard water."
0,"Fish skeletal muscles are composed of spatially well-separated fiber types, namely, red and white muscles with different physiological functions and metabolism. To compare the DNA methylation profiles of the two types of muscle tissues and identify potential candidate genes for the muscle growth and development under epigenetic regulation, genome-wide DNA methylation of the red and white muscle in Chinese perch Siniperca chuatsi were comparatively analyzed using bisulfate sequencing methods. An average of 0.9 billion 150-bp paired-end reads were obtained, of which 86% were uniquely mapped to the genome. Methylation mostly occurred at CG sites at a ratio of 94.43% in the red muscle and 93.16% in the white muscle. The mean methylation levels at C-sites were 5.95% in red muscle and 5.83% in white muscle, whereas the mean methylation levels of CG, CHG, and CHH were 73.23%, 0.62%, and 0.67% in red muscle, and 71.01%, 0.62%, and 0.67% in white muscle, respectively. A total of 4192 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified significantly enriched in cell signaling pathways related to skeletal muscle differentiation and growth. Various muscle-related genes, including myosin gene isoforms and regulatory factors, are differentially methylated in the promoter region between the red and white muscles. Further analysis of the transcriptional expression of these genes showed that the muscle regulatory factors (myf5, myog, pax3, pax7, and twitst2) and myosin genes (myh10, myh16, myo18a, myo7a, myo9a, and myl3) were differentially expressed between the two kinds of muscles, consistent with the DNA methylation analysis results. ELISA assays confirmed that the level of 5mC in red muscle was significantly higher than in white muscle (P < 0.05). The RT-qPCR assays revealed that the expression levels of the three DNA methylation transferase (dnmt) subtypes, dnmt1, dnmt3ab, and dnmt3bb1, were significantly higher in red muscle than in white muscle. The higher DNA methylation levels in the red muscle may result from higher DNA methylation transferase expression in the red muscles. Thus, this study might provide a theoretical foundation to better understand epigenetic regulation in the growth and development of red and white muscles in animals, at least in Chinese perch fish."
0,"The effects of either eicosapentaenoic (EPA)- or docosahexaenoic (DHA)-rich fish oils on hindlimb suspension (HS)-induced muscle disuse atrophy were compared. Daily oral supplementations (0.3 mL/100 g b.w.) with mineral oil (MO) or high EPA or high DHA fish oils were performed in adult rats. After 2 weeks, the animals were subjected to HS for further 2 weeks. The treatments were maintained alongside HS At the end of 4 weeks, we evaluated: body weight gain, muscle mass and fat depots, composition of fatty acids, cross-sectional areas (CSA) of the soleus muscle and soleus muscle fibers, activities of cathepsin L and 26S proteasome, and content of carbonylated proteins in the soleus muscle. Signaling pathway activities associated with protein synthesis (Akt, p70S6K, S6, 4EBP1, and GSK3-beta) and protein degradation (atrogin-1/MAFbx, and MuRF1) were evaluated. HS decreased muscle mass, CSA of soleus muscle and soleus muscle fibers, and altered signaling associated with protein synthesis (decreased) and protein degradation (increased). The treatment with either fish oil decreased the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids and changed protein synthesis-associated signaling. EPA-rich fish oil attenuated the changes induced by HS on 26S proteasome activity, CSA of soleus muscle fibers, and levels of p-Akt, total p70S6K, p-p70S6K/total p70S6K, p-4EBP1, p-GSK3-beta, p-ERK2, and total ERK 1/2 proteins. DHA-rich fish oil attenuated the changes induced by HS on p-4EBP1 and total ERK1 levels. The effects of EPA-rich fish oil on protein synthesis signaling were more pronounced. Both EPA- and DHA-rich fish oils did not impact skeletal muscle mass loss induced by non-inflammatory HS."
0,"Microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) has been used to increase the gel strength of surimi. Nevertheless, its effectiveness varies with fish species. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of MTGase at different levels on protein cross-linking and gel property of surimi from threadfin bream, Indian mackerel and sardine in the presence and absence of endogenous transglutaminase."
1,"Breaking force of all surimi gels increased as MTGase levels (0-0.6 U g⁻¹) increased except for threadfin bream surimi gel, where the breaking force decreased at 0.6 U g⁻¹ (P < 0.05). In the presence of EDTA, the gel strengthening effect was lower, suggesting the combined effect of endogenous transglutaminase with MTGase. With the addition of MTGase, the gel with the highest increase in breaking force showed highest decrease in myosin heavy chain. When cross-linking activity of MTGase on natural actomyosin (NAM) was determined, the highest decreasing rate in ε-amino group content with the concomitant increased formation of cross-linked proteins was found in NAM from threadfin bream. The reactivity of muscle proteins toward MTGase-induced cross-linking was in agreement with surimi gel strengthening."
2,"The composition and properties of muscle proteins of varying fish species more likely determined protein cross-linking induced by MTGase, thereby affecting their gel properties."
0,"Sardinelle protein hydrolysate (SPH), prepared by treatment with Bacillus subtilis A26 proteases, was found to exhibit antibacterial, antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities. SPH, with a degree of hydrolysis of 4%, was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 into five major fractions (F1-F5). F2, which exhibited the highest antibacterial and ACE-inhibitory activities, and F4, which exhibited the highest antibacterial and antioxidant activities, were further fractionated by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and then analysed using nano-ESI-LC-MS/MS to identify the sequences of peptides. Eight peptides were identified in the sub-fraction F2-A, nine peptides in the sub-fraction F4-B, and 45 peptides in F4-C. Identified peptides were found to share sequences with previously described bioactive peptides based on Biopep database. The results of this study suggest that SPH is a good source of natural bioactive peptides. Hence, it can be used as a potential ingredient in nutraceutical field."
0,"Recently, great attention has been directed towards the use of essential oils from aromatic plants as antimicrobials and antioxidant in food matrix. Fish is well known to be a high perishable food. Indeed, fish muscle is susceptible to suffer protein and lipid oxidation during frozen storage, which can lead to the development of softening and undesirable volatile molecules. However, the possible inclusion of essential oils in fish feed for preserving fish flesh quality during storage is still unclear. For this reason, the potential protective effects of the incorporation of a dietary essential oil constituted by eucalyptol, carvacrol and thymol, to rainbow trout's (Oncorhynchus mykiss) feed were here investigated. Frozen fish fillets resulting from trout fed the essential oil showed a significant protection of specific muscle proteins against the oxidation produced during frozen storage at -10ºC for 6 months. Essential oil-enriched feed decreased carbonylation of specific myofibrillar (α-actinins-1 and -3, myosin heavy chain, myomesin-1, pyruvate kinase, tropomyosin, troponin-T and actin) and sarcoplasmic proteins (glycogen phosphorylase, creatine kinase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A and phosphoglycerate mutase 2). Essential oils also increased actin stability and preserved muscle protein solubility and water holding capacity. In addition, essential oils inhibited the onset of lipid oxidation and rancidity, resulting in frozen fish with superior textural quality and sensory scores. As a final conclusion, the inclusion of essential oils in farmed rainbow trout feed is largely efficient for increasing fish quality and shelf life during frozen storage, mainly through a selective-antioxidant effect on muscle proteins."
0,"This study was carried out to investigate the enzymatic hydrolysis conditions on the properties of protein hydrolysate from fish muscle of the marine fish species Collichthys niveatus. About 160 fish samples were tested, and the analyzed fish species was found to be a lean fish with low fat (1.77 ± 0.01%) and high protein (16.76 ± 1.21%). Fish muscle of C. niveatus was carefully collected and hydrolyzed with four commercial enzymes: Alcalase, Neutrase, Protamex, and Flavourzyme under the conditions recommended by the manufacturers. Among the tested proteases, Neutrase catalyzed the hydrolysis process most effectively since the hydrolysate generated by Neutrase has the highest content of sweet and umami taste amino acids (SUA). The effect of hydrolysis conditions was further optimized using response surface methodology (RSM), and the optimum values for temperature, pH, and enzyme/substrate ratio (E/S ratio) were found to be 40.7 °C, 7.68, and 0.84%, respectively. Finally, the amino acid composition of the hydrolysate was analyzed by AccQ·Tag derivatization and HPLC-PDA determination. Major amino acids of the muscle of C. niveatus were threonine, glutamic acid, phenyalanine, tryptophan, and lysine, accounting for respectively 10.92%, 10.85%, 10.79%, 9.86%, and 9.76% of total amino acid content. The total content of essential amino acids was 970.7 ng·mL(-1), while that of nonessential amino acids was 709.1 ng·mL(-1). The results suggest that the fish muscle and its protein hydrolysate from C. niveatus provide a versatile supply of the benefits and can be incorporated as supplements in health-care foods."
0,"Chronic stress detrimentally affects animal health and homeostasis, with somatic growth, and thus skeletal muscle, being particularly affected. A detailed understanding of the underlying endocrine and molecular mechanisms of how chronic stress affects skeletal muscle growth remains lacking. To address this issue, the present study assessed primary (plasma cortisol), secondary (key components of the GH/IGF system, muscular proteolytic pathways, and apoptosis), and tertiary (growth performance) stress responses in fine flounder ( Paralichthys adspersus) exposed to crowding chronic stress. Levels of plasma cortisol, glucocorticoid receptor 2 ( gr2), and its target genes ( klf15 and redd1) mRNA increased significantly only at 4 wk of crowding ( P < 0.05). The components of the GH/IGF system, including ligands, receptors, and their signaling pathways, were significantly downregulated at 7 wk of crowding ( P < 0.05). Interestingly, chronic stress upregulated the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the intrinsic apoptosis pathways at 4wk ( P < 0.01), whereas autophagy was only significantly activated at 7 wk ( P < 0.05), and meanwhile the ubiquitin-proteasome and the apoptosis pathways returned to control levels. Overall growth was inhibited in fish in the 7-wk chronic stress trial ( P < 0.05). In conclusion, chronic stress directly affects muscle growth and downregulates the GH/IGF system, an action through which muscular catabolic mechanisms are promoted by two different and nonoverlapping proteolytic pathways. These findings provide new information on molecular mechanisms involved in the negative effects that chronic stress has on muscle anabolic/catabolic signaling balance."
0,"<b>Background:</b> Nucleotides have been used as functional nutrients to improve the growth and health of animals, including fish. The mechanism involved in the growth-promotion effect of nucleotides is still unclear.<b>Objective:</b> We investigated the bioenergetic mechanism underlying the growth-promotion effect of nucleotides in zebrafish and the associated roles played by the intestinal microbiota.<b>Methods:</b> Larval zebrafish were fed a control or a 0.1% mixed nucleotides-supplemented diet for 2 wk. Standard metabolic rate, the minimal rate of energy expenditure by animals at rest, was evaluated by oxygen consumption with the use of a respirometer. The expressions of fasting-induced adipose factor (Fiaf), inflammatory cytokines, and genes involved in fatty acid (FA) oxidation were tested by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The intestinal microbiota from the nucleotide-fed fish (NT fish) or control fish was transferred to 3-d postfertilization germ-free zebrafish in which oxygen consumption and expression of cytokines and <i>fiaf</i> were evaluated.<b>Results:</b> Compared with controls, nucleotide supplementation at 0.1% increased the weight and energy gains of zebrafish by 10% and 25%, respectively (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Standard metabolic rate was 28% lower in NT fish than in controls (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Nucleotide supplementation downregulated the inflammatory tone in the head kidney of the fish. Moreover, NT fish had a 51% lower intestinal expression of <i>fiaf</i> than did controls (<i>P</i> < 0.05), which was consistent with decreased expression of key genes involved in FA oxidation [carnitine:palmitoyl transferase 1a (<i>cpt1a</i>) and medium-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (<i>mcad</i>)] in liver and muscle. Germ-free zebrafish colonized with microbiota from NT fish had a 25% lower standard metabolic rate than did those colonized by control microbiota (<i>P</i> < 0.01), whereas direct nucleotide feeding of germ-free zebrafish did not affect standard metabolic rate relative to germ-free controls that were not fed nucleotides. Furthermore, germ-free zebrafish colonized with nucleotide microbiota exhibited downregulated inflammatory tone and 33% lower <i>fiaf</i> expression compared with their control microbiota-colonized counterparts.<b>Conclusions:</b> The growth-promoting effect of dietary nucleotides in zebrafish involves 2 intestinal microbiota-mediated mechanisms that result in reduced standard metabolic rate: <i>1</i>) lower inflammatory tone and <i>2</i>) reduced FA oxidation associated with increased microbial suppression of intestinal <i>fiaf</i>."
0,"Centesimal composition and lipid profiles were evaluated in muscle tissue of four species of Brazilian fish using the Kjeldahl and Bligh & Dyer gravimetric methods and gas chromatography, respectively. The moisture, protein, total lipid, and ash values (g/100g) ranged from 71.13 to 78.39; 18.10 to 19.87; 1.05 to 9.03; and 1.03 to 1.73, respectively. Palmitic acid was prevalent among the saturated fatty acids (10.89-20.38%) and oleic acid was the main monounsaturated acid identified (4.26-15.77%). The eicosapentaenoic-EPA (6.41-10.66%) and docosahexaenoic-DHA (9.12-30.20%) acids were the most prevalent polyunsaturated acids. The average values, which are indicative of nutritional quality, were: Polyunsaturated/saturated (P/S) (1.11-1.47), ω6/ω3 (0.08-0.21), hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic acid ratios (HH) (0.87-2.43), atherogenicity index (IA) (0.26-0.60), and thrombogenicity index (IT) (0.20-0.44). These results demonstrated that the lipid profiles of the studied species are of nutritional quality. "
0,"Although 95% of fish-allergic patients are sensitized to the major fish allergen parvalbumin, clinical reactions to different fish species vary considerably in symptoms, intensity and frequency in allergic subjects. This study aimed at the quantification of parvalbumin levels in salmon, trout, cod, carp, mackerel, herring, redfish and tuna."
1,Fish muscle extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and parvalbumin content was estimated by densitometric band quantification. Individual antisera were raised in BALB/c mice against parvalbumins purified from seven fish species. Parvalbumin content was quantified in fish (raw/processed) and skin prick test (SPT) solutions by ELISA using the corresponding anti-serum for detection and the purified parvalbumins as standards.
2,"Using SDS-PAGE scanning, parvalbumin contents were <0.5 mg per gram tissue for mackerel, 0.5-2 mg for salmon and trout, and >2 mg for cod, carp, redfish and herring. Using ELISA, parvalbumin content ranged from <0.05 mg for tuna, 0.3-0.7 mg for mackerel, 1-2.5 mg for salmon, trout and cod to >2.5 mg per gram raw muscle for carp, herring and redfish. The parvalbumin content of processed samples (cooked/commercial) was 20-60% lower. Allergen content in SPT samples ranged from 20 to 70 μg parvalbumin/ml of extract. No parvalbumin was found in tuna SPT solution."
3,The parvalbumin content of most commonly consumed fish species varies considerably. Differences range from severalfold to one hundredfold. This has to be taken into account when designing food challenge tests and advising fish-allergic patients.
0,"Puffer fish saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin binding protein (PSTBP) is a glycoprotein (200 kDa as a dimer) that we previously isolated from the plasma of Fugu pardalis (Yotsu-Yamashita et al., 2001). For the study on functions of PSTBP, here we examined distribution of homologous proteins to PSTBP in the plasma of seven species of puffer fish, and among the tissues of F. pardalis by Western blot analysis probed with a polyclonal IgG against unglycosylated PSTBP1 expressed in Echelichia coli. One or two major positive broad bands were detected at 105-140 kDa molecular weight range in the plasma (0.5 microg protein) of all species of puffer fish tested, while no band was detected in the plasma (5 microg protein) of fish other than puffer fish. Glycopeptidase F treated plasma of all species of puffer fish tested commonly showed the bands at approximately 42 kDa that was consistent to the molecular weight of unglycosylated PSTBP. These data suggest that puffer fish commonly possess glycoproteins homologous to PSTBP, but the sizes of N-glycan are specific to the species. Among soluble protein extracts (5 microg protein) from the tissues of F. pardalis, PSTBP was detected in all tissues examined, most prominently in heart, skin, and gall."
0,"In the digestive tract of humans, bioactive peptides, i.e. protein fragments impacting the physiological activity of the body, may be released during the digestion of food proteins, including those of fish. The aim of the study was to establish the method of human ex vivo digestion of carp muscle tissue and evaluate the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory and antioxidant activities of hydrolysates obtained after digestion. It was found that the hydrolysates of carp muscle tissue obtained with the three-stage method of simulated ex vivo digestion showed ACE inhibitory as well as antioxidative activities. It was demonstrated that the degree of hydrolysis depended on the duration of individual stages and the degree of comminution of the examined material. Although the applied gastric juices initiated the process of hydrolysis of carp muscle tissue, the duodenal juices caused a rapid increase in the amount of hydrolysed polypeptide bonds. The antihypertensive and antioxidative activities of the hydrolysates of carp muscle tissue increased together with progressive protein degradation. However, the high degree of protein hydrolysis does not favour an increase in the activity of free radical scavenging. The presented results are an example of the first preliminary screening of the potential health-promoting biological activity of carp muscle tissue in an ex vivo study. "
0,"The formation of new myofibers in vertebrates occurs by myoblast fusion and requires fusogenic activity of the muscle-specific membrane protein myomaker. Here, using <i>in silico</i> (BLAST) genome analyses, we show that the <i>myomaker</i> gene from trout includes 14 minisatellites, indicating that it has an unusual structure compared with those of other animal species. We found that the trout <i>myomaker</i> gene encodes a 434-amino acid (aa) protein, in accordance with its apparent molecular mass (∼40 kDa) observed by immunoblotting. The first half of the trout myomaker protein (1-220 aa) is similar to the 221-aa mouse myomaker protein, whereas the second half (222-234 aa) does not correspond to any known motifs and arises from two protein extensions. The first extension (∼70 aa) apparently appeared with the radiation of the bony fish clade Euteleostei, whereas the second extension (up to 236 aa) is restricted to the superorder Protacanthopterygii (containing salmonids and pike) and corresponds to the insertion of minisatellites having a length of 30 nucleotides. According to gene expression analyses, trout <i>myomaker</i> expression is consistently associated with the formation of new myofibers during embryonic development, postlarval growth, and muscle regeneration. Using cell-mixing experiments, we observed that trout myomaker has retained the ability to drive the fusion of mouse fibroblasts with C2C12 myoblasts. Our work reveals that trout myomaker has fusogenic function despite containing two protein extensions."
0,"The impact of water temperature on the physiology of Channa punctata (Bloch, 1793) was evaluated in the present study. Fish were acclimated at 25 ± 1 °C and then exposed at six different temperatures: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C. C. punctata exposed at 10, 15, and 20 °C showed 30, 21, and 11% reduced food consumption, respectively compared to 25 °C. Significantly higher respiratory burst and myeloperoxidase activities were found in fish exposed at 20 and 25 °C after 12 h of exposure compared to other treatments. Nitric oxide synthase was significantly higher at 25 °C after 12 h and at 25 and 30 °C exposed fish after 7 days compared to others. The reduced glutathione level was significantly higher at 25 °C compared to other treatments after 7 days of exposure. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level was minimum at 25 °C. Significantly lower antioxidant enzymes, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase were found in gills of fish exposed at 25 °C compared to others in both samples. The highest antioxidant enzyme levels were found at 10 °C. Heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 levels were significantly lower in liver and muscle of fish exposed at 25 °C compared to other treatments. The Hsp level was significantly higher at 35 and 30 °C exposed fish compared to others after 12 h, and the level reduced after 7 days in these treatments. Thermal stress affects food consumption rate, immune system, antioxidant enzymes, and enzyme systems in fish. The elevated Hsp70 level serves as a biomarker of stress in C. punctata.

0,"The Cpi-17 (<i>ppp1r14</i>) gene family is an evolutionarily conserved, vertebrate specific group of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitors. When phosphorylated, Cpi-17 is a potent inhibitor of myosin phosphatase (MP), a holoenzyme complex of the regulatory subunit Mypt1 and the catalytic subunit PP1. Myosin phosphatase dephosphorylates the regulatory myosin light chain (Mlc2) and promotes actomyosin relaxation, which in turn, regulates numerous cellular processes including smooth muscle contraction, cytokinesis, cell motility, and tumor cell invasion. We analyzed zebrafish homologs of the Cpi-17 family, to better understand the mechanisms of myosin phosphatase regulation. We found single homologs of both Kepi (<i>ppp1r14c</i>) and Gbpi (<i>ppp1r14d</i>) in silico, but we detected no expression of these genes during early embryonic development. Cpi-17 (<i>ppp1r14a</i>) and Phi-1 (<i>ppp1r14b</i>) each had two duplicate paralogs, (<i>ppp1r14aa</i> and <i>ppp1r14ab</i>) and (<i>ppp1r14ba</i> and <i>ppp1r14bb</i>), which were each expressed during early development. The spatial expression pattern of these genes has diverged, with <i>ppp1r14aa</i> and <i>ppp1r14bb</i> expressed primarily in smooth muscle and skeletal muscle, respectively, while <i>ppp1r14ab</i> and <i>ppp1r14ba</i> are primarily expressed in neural tissue. We observed that, in in vitro and heterologous cellular systems, the Cpi-17 paralogs both acted as potent myosin phosphatase inhibitors, and were indistinguishable from one another. In contrast, the two Phi-1 paralogs displayed weak myosin phosphatase inhibitory activity in vitro, and did not alter myosin phosphorylation in cells. Through deletion and chimeric analysis, we identified that the difference in specificity for myosin phosphatase between Cpi-17 and Phi-1 was encoded by the highly conserved PHIN (phosphatase holoenzyme inhibitory) domain, and not the more divergent N- and C- termini. We also showed that either Cpi-17 paralog can rescue the knockdown phenotype, but neither Phi-1 paralog could do so. Thus, we provide new evidence about the biochemical and developmental distinctions of the zebrafish Cpi-17 protein family."
0,"The historically recent domestication of fishes has been essential to meet the protein demands of a growing human population. Selection for traits of interest during domestication is a complex process whose epigenetic basis is poorly understood. Cytosine hydroxymethylation is increasingly recognized as an important DNA modification involved in epigenetic regulation. In the present study, we investigated if hydroxymethylation plays a role in fish domestication and demonstrated for the first time at a genome-wide level and single nucleotide resolution that the muscle hydroxymethylome changes after a single generation of Nile tilapia (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>, Linnaeus) domestication. The overall decrease in hydroxymethylcytosine levels was accompanied by the downregulation of 2015 genes in fish reared in captivity compared to their wild progenitors. In contrast, several myogenic and metabolic genes that can affect growth potential were upregulated. There were 126 differentially hydroxymethylated cytosines between groups, which were not due to genetic variation; they were associated with genes involved in immune-, growth- and neuronal-related pathways. Taken together, our data unveil a new role for DNA hydroxymethylation in epigenetic regulation of fish domestication with impact in aquaculture and implications in artificial selection, environmental adaptation and genome evolution."
0,"Clock genes are considered to be the molecular core of biological clock in vertebrates and they are directly involved in the regulation of daily rhythms in vertebrate tissues such as skeletal muscles. Fish myotomes are composed of anatomically segregated fast and slow muscle fibers that possess different metabolic and contractile properties. To date, there is no report on the characterization of the circadian clock system components of slow muscles in fish."
1,"In the present study, the molecular clock components (clock, arntl1/2, cry1/2/3, cry-dash, npas2, nr1d1/2, per1/2/3, rorα and tim genes) and their daily transcription levels were characterized in slow and fast muscles of Chinese perch (Siniperca chuatsi). Among the 15 clock genes, nrld2 and per3 had no daily rhythmicity in slow muscles, and cry2/3 and tim displayed no daily rhythmicity in fast muscles of the adult fish. In the slow muscles, the highest expression of the most clock paralogs occurred at the dark period except arntl1, nr1d1, nr1d2 and tim. With the exception of nr1d2 and tim, the other clock genes had an acrophase at the light period in fast muscles. The circadian expression of the myogenic regulatory factors (mrf4 and myf5), mstn and pnca showed either a positive or a negative correlation with the transcription pattern of the clock genes in both types of muscles."
2,It was the first report to unravel the molecular clock components of the slow and fast muscles in vertebrates. The expressional pattern differences of the clock genes between the two types of muscle fibers suggest that the clock system may play key roles on muscle type-specific tissue maintenance and function.
0,"Follistatin-related protein (FSRP), which belongs to a member of the follistatin family, has been postulated to be a new negative regulator of myostatin (MSTN) and is involved in muscle development. In this study, we cloned the complete cDNA sequence of FSRP-1 from Chinese perch muscle. FSRP-1 mRNA was highly expressed in the fast muscle and brain tissue of adult fish. The expression of FSRP-1 rapidly increased at 90 days post hatching (dph) in the fast muscle of Chinese perch. Furthermore, to investigate the roles of FSRP-1 in muscle growth, we constructed a FSRP- 1 expression vector and isolated FSRP-1 fusion protein. The purified FSRP-1 fusion protein was injected into the muscle tissues of the Chinese perch (90 dph). The results showed that the number of muscle fibers and the satellite cell activation frequency were increased in the FSRP-1 treatment group. In addition, the myostatin (MSTN) expression was significantly decreased upon the FSRP-1 treatment. Collectively, the results suggest a possible mechanism of the FSRP-1 for inhibiting MSTN activity and enhancing muscle growth and renewal in vivo, and it may provide an applicable implication for the defected muscle repairing and regeneration."
0,"Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) muscle was subjected to 6 protein extraction and precipitation techniques using acid solubilization (pH 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0) or alkaline solubilization (pH 10.5, 11.0, 11.5) followed by precipitation at pH 5.5. The catfish protein isolate was compared with ground defatted white muscle. Alkali-processed catfish showed increased gel rigidity, gel strength, and gel flexibility compared to acid-processed catfish, which exhibited inconsistent functional performance, increasing and decreasing gel rigidity, gel strength, and gel flexibility. The gel rigidity (G') at pH 3.0 in the absence of salt had the highest G' of the acid treatments and was not significantly different from the alkaline-treated catfish muscle (P>0.05). However in the presence of added salt pH treatment it had the lowest G' and was different from alkaline treatments (P<0.05) during break force testing. These results show that pH-shift processing of channel catfish muscle provides highly functional isolates with a potentially broad range of applications. This range of applications is possible due to the modification of the textural properties of catfish muscle protein produced using different acidic or alkaline pH solubility treatments."
0,"Uncoupling proteins (UCP) are able to increase H(+) leakage across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus dissipating the membrane potential and increasing oxygen consumption. Despite the identification of several UCP orthologs in birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, little is known about their functional properties in fish. The aim of this work was to identify and characterize a UCP in mitochondria found in goldfish white skeletal muscle. Western blot analysis, using a polyclonal antibody raised against mammalian UCP3, showed a single band at approximately 32 kDa. During non-phosphorylating respiration, we observed that palmitate promoted a dose-dependent increase in oxygen consumption that is abolished by addition of BSA (fatty acid chelator). Interestingly, this palmitate-induced increase in oxygen consumption was not inhibited by GDP, a well-known UCP inhibitor. In phosphorylating mitochondria, palmitate lowered both ADP/O ratio (number of atoms of phosphorus incorporated as ATP per molecule of O2 consumed) and the respiratory control ratio. Moreover, we found that different fatty acids can modulate mitochondrial membrane potential. In conclusion, our results suggest that goldfish UCP is functionally similar to the UCP found in other species, including mammals."
0,"Parvalbumins play crucial physiological roles in neuromuscular systems of vertebrates, such as cell-cycle, development of neurons, contraction of muscles, and regulation of intracellular calcium. To perform these neuromuscular functions, parvalbumin may be in associated with other proteins including calbindin, carbonic anhydrase, and cytochrome oxidase. Humans may show an IgE-specific hypersensitivity to parvalbumins after consumption of some distinct fish species. While this protein is abundant in fish muscles, literature review of publications related to fish parvalbumins, do not point to the presence of parvalbumins in eukaryotic microbes. In this study, we propose that distantly related parvalbumins may be found in some non-fish species. Bioinformatics studies such as multiple sequence alignment (MSA), phylogenetic analysis as well as molecular-based experiments indicate that, at least two parvalbumins sequences (UniProt IDs: A0A178F775 and A0A178F7E4) with EF-hand domains and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites could be identified in Trichophyton violaceum, a pathogenic fungal species. It was determined that both genes consisted of a single exon and encoded for parvalbumin proteins possessing conserved amino acid motifs. Antigenicity prediction revealed antigenic sites located in both sides of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site of the first EF-hand domain. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that one of parvalbumins (UniProt ID: 0A178F775) can be evolved to other parvalbumins in T. violaceum (UniProt ID: A0A178F7E4) and fish species through evolutionary phenomenon. To confirm our in-silico findings, we designed three primer pairs to detect one of the T. violaceum parvalbumins (UniProt ID: A0A178F7E4) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); one primer pair showed a strong and specific band in agarose gel electrophoresis. To evaluate the specificity of the method, the primers were tested on extracted DNA from Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes. The results demonstrated that the evaluated parvalbumin gene (UniProt ID: A0A178F7E4) was T. violaceum-specific and this pathogenic fungus can be differentiated from T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes through identification of parvalbumin genes. Further studies are necessary to unravel the biochemical and physiological functions of parvalbumins in T. violaceum."
0,"Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation provides over 90% of the energy produced by aerobic organisms, therefore the regulation of mitochondrial activity is a major issue for coping with the changing environment and energy needs. In fish, there is a large body of evidence of adaptive changes in enzymatic activities of the OXPHOS pathway, but less is known at the transcriptional level and the first aim of the present study was to define the molecular identity of the actively transcribed subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain of a livestock animal, using gilthead sea bream as a model of farmed fish with a high added value for European aquaculture. Extensive BLAST searches in our transcriptomic database (www.nutrigroup-iats.org/seabreamdb) yielded 97 new sequences with a high coverage of catalytic, regulatory and assembly factors of Complex I to V. This was the basis for the development of a PCR array for the simultaneous profiling of 88 selected genes. This new genomic resource allowed the differential gene expression of liver and muscle tissues in a model of 10 fasting days. A consistent down-regulated response involving 72 genes was made by the liver, whereas an up-regulated response with 29 and 10 differentially expressed genes was found in white skeletal muscle and heart, respectively. This differential regulation was mostly mediated by nuclear-encoded genes (skeletal muscle) or both mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded genes (liver, heart), which is indicative of a complex and differential regulation of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, according to the changes in the lipogenic activity of liver and the oxidative capacity of glycolytic and highly oxidative muscle tissues. These insights contribute to the identification of the most responsive elements of OXPHOS in each tissue, which is of relevance for the appropriate gene targeting of nutritional and/or environmental metabolic disturbances in livestock animals.

0,"To help remedy damage from harmful algal blooms, an attempt was made to isolate an algicidal substance previously observed to be present in mackerel muscle hydrolysate. Crude extract was obtained by cold acetone precipitation, and it dissolved best in water. Through molecular weight cut-off determination and tricine-SDS PAGE, the algicidal substance was determined to be a peptide of <1 kDa. Based on this result, purification was first performed using size exclusion chromatography and preparative reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Then, the active algicidal fraction was applied to an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry system, followed by MS/MS analysis. The algicidal peptide had linear structure consisting of amino acids with sequence NH-KMNF-COOH. Its calculated properties were: molecular weight 538.66 g/mol; isoelectric point 9.91; net charge +1 at pH 7.0; and 50% hydrophobicity. Algicidal ability of the identified peptide was confirmed using synthesized peptide. The LC<sub>50</sub> values toward four harmful algal blooming species were 0.69, 0.83, 0.85 and 1.24 mg/ml for Alexandrium fundyense, A. catenella, Heterocapsa triquetra, and Prorocentrum minimum, respectively. There was no coincidence in the sequence of the identified peptide with those of known metabolites in the APD, Norine, CAMP, UniProt and METLIN databases. Consequently, this algicidal substance originating from mackerel protein was deduced to be a novel peptide that can usefully be applied to relieve harmful algal blooms."
0,"Protein metabolism, including the interrelated processes of synthesis and degradation, mediates the growth of an animal. In ectothermic animals, protein metabolism is responsive to changes in both biotic and abiotic conditions. This study aimed to characterise responses of protein metabolism to food deprivation that occur in the coldwater salmonid, Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus. We compared two groups of Arctic charr: one fed continuously and the other deprived of food for 36 days. We measured the fractional rate of protein synthesis (KS) in individuals from the fed and fasted groups using a flooding dose technique modified for the use of deuterium-labelled phenylalanine. The enzyme activities of the three major protein degradation pathways (ubiquitin proteasome, lysosomal cathepsins and the calpain systems) were measured in the same fish. This study is the first to measure both KS and the enzymatic activity of protein degradation in the same fish, allowing us to examine the apparent contribution of different protein degradation pathways to protein turnover in various tissues (red and white muscle, liver, heart and gills). KS was lower in the white muscle and in liver of the fasted fish compared to the fed fish. There were no observable effects of food deprivation on the protease activities in any of the tissues with the exception of liver, where the ubiquitin proteasome pathway seemed to be activated during fasting conditions. Lysosomal proteolysis appears to be the primary degradation pathway for muscle protein, while the ubiquitin proteasome pathway seems to predominate in the liver. We speculate that Arctic charr regulate protein metabolism during food deprivation to conserve proteins. "
0,"The fluorescent protein toolbox has revolutionized experimental biology. Despite this advance, no fluorescent proteins have been identified from vertebrates, nor has chromogenic ligand-inducible activation or clinical utility been demonstrated. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of UnaG, a fluorescent protein from Japanese eel. UnaG belongs to the fatty-acid-binding protein (FABP) family, and expression in eel is restricted to small-diameter muscle fibers. On heterologous expression in cell lines or mouse brain, UnaG produces oxygen-independent green fluorescence. Remarkably, UnaG fluorescence is triggered by an endogenous ligand, bilirubin, a membrane-permeable heme metabolite and clinical health biomarker. The holoUnaG structure at 1.2 Å revealed a biplanar coordination of bilirubin by reversible π-conjugation, and we used this high-affinity and high-specificity interaction to establish a fluorescence-based human bilirubin assay with promising clinical utility. UnaG will be the prototype for a versatile class of ligand-activated fluorescent proteins, with applications in research, medicine, and bioengineering. "
0,"Mammalian EGF containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 2 (Fibulin-4/EFEMP2), an extracellular matrix(ECM) protein and a member of the fibulin family, is involved in elastic fiber formation, connective tissue development and some human diseases. In a yeast-two hybrid screening of host proteins interacting with outer capsid protein of grass carp reovirus (GCRV), a grass carp homologue of Fibulin-4 (designated as GcFibulin-4) is suggested to hold the potential to bind VP7, VP56 and VP55, the outer capsid protein encoded by type I, II, III GCRV, respectively. GcFibulin-4 gene of grass carp was cloned and sequenced from the cDNA library constructed for the yeast two-hybrid screening. Full-length cDNA of GcFibulin-4 contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 1323 bp encoding a putative protein of 440 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of GcFibulin-4 indicated that it shared a high homology with zebra fish Fibulin-4 protein. Transcriptional distribution analysis of GcFibulin-4 in various tissues of healthy grass carp showed that GcFibulin-4 was highly expressed in muscle, moderately expressed in the intestine and brain, and slightly expressed in other examined tissues; the expression pattern is consistent with tissue tropism of GCRV resulting in hemorrhage symptom in the corresponding tissues. Our results suggested that Fibulin-4 might enable free GCRV particles, the pathogen for grass carp hemorrhagic disease, to target fish tissues more efficiently by interacting with viral outer capsid proteins.

0,"Silver barb (Puntius gonionotus) is considered as a promising medium-sized carp species for freshwater aquaculture in Asia. This study in silver barb was carried out to evaluate the effects of increasing dietary levels of lipid on growth, nutrient utilization, whole-body composition, tissue fatty acid composition and Δ6 fatty acyl desaturase (Δ6 fad) gene expression. Fish (11.3 ± 0.23 g of initial body weight) was fed for 60 days with five experimental diets: FO-0 (control feed); FO-30; FO-60; FO-90 and FO-120 containing 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 g fish oil kg<sup>-1</sup> diet, respectively. Among the diets, the highest specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and whole-body lipid content, and the lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) were recorded with FO-120 diet. The saturated fatty acids (SFA) level in the muscle was significantly (P < .05) increased with the enhanced FO supplementation, whereas monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) level decreased. Increased level of fish oil in the diet also enhanced the n-3 PUFA and n-3 LC-PUFA (long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid) in the muscle and liver. The expression of Δ6 fad gene was downregulated, whereas the serum biochemical constituents were either remain unchanged or enhanced with increased FO supplementation in the diets of silver barb."
0,"This study evaluated the effects of high intensity ultrasonication (HIU, 100, 150, 200, and 250 W) and treatment time (0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 min) on the structure and emulsification properties of myofibrillar proteins (MPs) from Coregonus peled. These investigations were conducted using an ultrasonic generator at a frequency of 20 kHz (ultrasonic probe). Analysis of the carbonyl content and total number of sulfhydryl groups showed that HIU significantly improved the oxidative modification of MPs (P < 0.05). SDS-PAGE profiling showed significant degradation of the myosin heavy chain (P < 0.05). In addition, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that HIU altered these treated MP secondary structures, this was due to molecular unfolding and stretching, exposing interior hydrophobic groups. Particle size analysis showed that HIU treatment reduced particle sizes. Solubility, emulsification capacity, and emulsion stability were improved significantly, and each decreased with an increase in treatment time (up to 12 min), indicating aggregation with prolonged sonication. These results indicate that HIU could improve the emulsification properties of MPs from C. peled, demonstrating a promising method for fish protein processing."
0,"A full-length complementary (c)DNA sequence encoding follistatin-related protein 3 (fsrp-3) was determined from skeletal muscle in Chinese mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi, its molecular structure was characterised and its function suggested. The putative structure of S. chuatsi Fsrp-3 contains an N-terminal domain and two follistatin domains. Quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT)-PCR assays revealed that fsrp-3 messenger (m)RNA was differentially expressed among assayed tissues and was highly expressed in heart and intestine. fsrp-3 mRNA exhibited increasing expression from the larval to the juvenile stage (500 g). To investigate the potential function of S. chuatsi fsrp-3 in muscle growth, we constructed a Fsrp-3 prokaryotic expression system and injected the purified Fsrp-3 fusion protein into the dorsal muscle. Fsrp-3 administration significantly influenced cross-section area, satellite cell activation frequency and nuclear density of S. chuatsi muscle fibres. Following Fsrp-3 treatment, the expression of myogenic regulatory factors was up-regulated and decline in the expression of myostatin was observed. The study revealed that Fsrp-3 may affect muscle growth by regulating myogenic regulatory factor expression and antagonizing myostatin function to initiate satellite cell activation and differentiation in S. chuatsi."
0,"Growth-related dynamics of intracellular protease activities in four year classes of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L. 1758) parr and smolts inhabiting salmon rivers of northwestern Russia (the White Sea basin) were studied. Cathepsin B, cathepsin D, proteasome, and calpain activities in the skeletal muscles of salmon were assessed to investigate their relative contribution to the total protein degradation as well as to young fish growth process. It was confirmed that calpain activity dominates in salmon muscles while proteasome plays a minor role, in contrast to terrestrial vertebrates. Calpain and proteasome activities were maximal at the early post-larval stage (in parrs 0+) and declined with age (parrs 1+ through 2+) dropping to the lowest level in salmon smolts. Annual growth increments and proteolytic activities of calpains and proteasome in the muscles of salmon juveniles changed with age in an orchestrated manner, while lysosomal cathepsin activities increased with age. Comparing protease activities and growth increments in salmon parr and smolts we suggested that the partial suppression of the protein degradation could be a mechanism stimulating efficient growth in smoltifying salmon. Growth and smoltification-related dynamics of protease activities was quite similar in salmon populations from studied spawning rivers, such as Varzuga and Indera; however, some habitat-related differences were observed. Growth increments and protease activities varied in salmon parr 0+ (but not on later ages) inhabiting either main rivers or small tributaries apparently due to habitat difference on the resources for fish growth."
0,"An emerging concept is that the hypothalamic nutrient sensor can regulate peripheral energy metabolism via a brain-liver circuit. Valine is an essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) that drives intracellular signaling cascades by the activation of target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) which is critical to protein metabolism in mammals. However, in teleost fish, it remains scarce in this area especially about how the intraventricular (ICV) injection of valine can mediate the protein metabolism in peripheral organs. This study would tentatively explore the effects of ICV injection of valine on protein metabolism in peripheral organs through evaluating the postprandial ammonia-N excretion rate in Chinese perch. The control group was injected with 5-μL PBS, and the Val group was injected with 20-μg L valine dissolved into 5-μL PBS. The ammonia-N excretion rate of Val group was lower than control group at 4-, 12-, and 24-h postinjection, while the concertation of plasma glucose was increased sharply at 0.5-, 4-, 12-, and 24-h postinjection. We further checked both mRNA level and the enzyme activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in the liver and adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD) in muscle, and we found that they were obviously decreased in Val group at 4-, 12-, and 24-h postinjection. The phosphorylation level of ribosomal protein S6, a downstream target protein of TORC1, was markedly enhanced in the liver of Val group at 4-, 12-, and 24-h postinjection. Collectively, these results illustrated that ICV injection of valine can attenuate protein degradation in peripheral organs by depressing the GDH and AMPD enzyme activity; on the other hand, the injected valine can trigger the activation of TORC1 in the liver via a brain-liver circuit and then interdict proteolysis."
0,"The effects of stocking density on growth performance, serum biochemistry, digestive enzymes, immune response, and muscle quality of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) reared in nine in-pond raceway systems (IPRS, 22.0 m × 5.0 m × 2.0 m) were studied. M. salmoides with initial an body weight of 8.25 ± 0.51 g and body length of 6.99 ± 0.44 cm were reared at an initial stocking density of 90.91 ind./m<sup>3</sup> (low stocking density, LSD), 113.63 ind./m<sup>3</sup> (middle stocking density, MSD), and 136.36 ind./m<sup>3</sup> (high stocking density, HSD) with triplication. After 300 days of culture, MSD recorded the highest final body weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, and yield, but the food conversion ratio in MSD was the lowest. The viscerosomatic index in LSD was significantly higher than other groups. The fish serum reared at HSD showed significantly lower total protein, higher total cholesterol, triglyceride, total bilirubin, glucose content, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase activity. Significantly lower intestinal amylase, lipase, trypsin activities, hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, and higher malondialdehyde content were detected in HSD compared to others. The content of crude lipid, saturated fatty acid decreased, and total essential amino acid, delicious amino acid, and polyunsaturated fatty acid increased in muscle with stocking density increase. No significant difference was observed in muscle texture. Profitability analysis indicated the benefit-to-cost ratio varied between 1.10 and 1.68, of which MSD was significantly higher than others. The optimal stocking density for M. salmoides should be 113.63 ind./m<sup>3</sup> in an IPRS farm."
0,"Rainbow trout are considered glucose intolerant because they are poor utilizers of glucose, despite having functional insulin receptors and glucose transporters. Following high carbohydrate meals, rainbow trout are persistently hyperglycemic, which is likely due to low glucose utilization in peripheral tissues including the muscle. Also, rainbow trout myogenic precursor cells (MPCs) treated in vitro with insulin and IGF1 increase glucose uptake and protein synthesis, whereas protein degradation is decreased. Given our understanding of glucose regulation in trout, we sought to understand how glucose concentrations affect protein synthesis, protein degradation; and expression of genes associated with muscle growth and proteolysis in MPCs. We found that following 24 h and 48 h of treatment with low glucose media (5.6 mM), myoblasts had significant decreases in protein synthesis. Also, low glucose treatments affected the expression of both mstn2a and igfbp5. These findings support that glucose is a direct regulator of protein synthesis and growth-related mechanisms in rainbow trout muscle."
0,"This paper presents the first proteome network map for the sarcoplasmic fish proteome. A total of 183 non-redundant annotated proteins were identified in a shotgun proteome-wide analysis from 15 different fish species. The final protein compilation was investigated by integrated in-silico studies, including functional GO term enrichment, pathways studies and networks analysis. An in-silico interactomics map was built up merging all the identified proteins. The whole confidence network contains 84 nodes and 279 interactions. Most of the sarcoplasmic fish proteins were grouped under pathways and networks referring to energy, catabolism and lipid metabolism. As a new potential nutritional ingredient valuable bioactive peptides were also predicted after an in-silico human gastrointestinal digestion. As is presented in this study, the integrated global proteomics results and the bioinformatics analysis of the sarcoplasmic fish proteome show the feasibility of this approach to provide a comprehensive knowledge of this fraction since a functional and nutritional point of view."
0,"Growth is one of the main biological processes in aquatic organisms that is affected by environmental fluctuations such as upwelling (characterized by food-rich waters). In fish, growth is directly related with skeletal muscle increase; which represents the largest tissue of body mass. However, the effects of upwelling on growth, at the physiological and molecular level, are unknown. This study used Girella laevifrons (one of the most abundant intertidal fish in Eastern South Pacific) as a biological model, considering animals from upwelling (U) and non-upwelling (NU) areas. Here, we evaluated the effect of nutritional composition and food availability on growth performance and expression of key growth-related genes (insulin-kike growth factor 1 (igf1) and myosin heavy-chain (myhc)) and atrophy-related genes (muscle ring-finger 1 (murf1), F-box only protein 32 (atrogin-1) and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19kDa-interacting protein 3 (bnip3)). We reported that, among zones, U fish displayed higher growth performance in response to nutritional composition, specifically between protein- and fiber-rich diets (~1g). We also found in NU fish that atrophy-related genes were upregulated with fiber-rich diet and during fasting (~2-fold at minimum respect U). In conclusion, our results suggest that the growth potential of upwelling fish may be a consequence of differential muscle gene expression. Our data provide a preliminary approach contributing on how upwelling influence fish growth at the physiological and molecular levels. Future studies are required to gain further knowledge about molecular differences between U and NU animals, as well as the possible applications of this knowledge in the aquaculture industry."
0,"This study investigated the hypothesis that dietary supplementation of fish oil as a source of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) influences the expression of target genes of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP)-1 and (SREBP)-2 involved in triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism in the liver, and moreover activates the expression of target genes of peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor (PPAR)-α involved in TAG and fatty acid catabolism in liver and skeletal muscle. Twenty lactating sows were fed a control diet or a fish oil diet with either 50 g of a mixture of palm oil and soya bean oil (4:1, w/w) or fish oil per kg. The diet of the fish oil group contained 19.1 g of n-3 PUFA (mainly 20:5 n-3 and 22:6 n-3) per 100 g of total fatty acids, while the diet of the control group contained 2.4 g of n-3 PUFA (mainly 18:3 n-3) per 100 g of total fatty acids. The fish oil group had reduced relative mRNA concentrations of various target genes of SREBP-1 involved in fatty acid and TAG synthesis in comparison with the control group (p < 0.05). Relative mRNA concentrations of target genes of PPARα involved in fatty acid catabolism in both liver and muscle, and mRNA concentrations of target genes of SREBP-2 involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake were not influenced by fish oil supplementation. Concentrations of cholesterol and TAG in plasma, fat content of milk and weight gains of litters during the suckling period were not different between the two groups of sows. In conclusion, this study suggests that fish oil has only minor effects on hepatic lipid metabolism, which are non-critical with respect to milk production in sows. "
0,"This study was conducted to assess the impacts of prolonged fasting (70 and 120 days) on the morphological, biochemical, oxidative stress responses, immune-related gene expression, histopathology, and DNA damage in rainbow trout. Final weight (FW), hepatosomatic index (HSI), and condition factor (CF) significantly decreased in both 70 and 120 days of fasting compared to the pre-fasting group (p < 0.05). Fasting led to a significant reduction in serum blood metabolites (glucose, total protein, triglyceride, T. cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)) and endogenous reserves (protein and lipid). However, plasma acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), interleukin (IL1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF1α), and transferrin (TF) increased significantly (p < 0.05). While malondialdehyde (MDA) levels compared to the pre-fasting group increased in the liver and muscle tissues (70 and 120 days), glutathione (GSH) enzyme activities decreased significantly in both tissues (p < 0.05). Histopathologically, both fasting groups (70 and 120 days) when compared to the pre-fasting group led to steatosis, necrosis and degeneration in hepatocytes, inflammation and hyperemia in the liver tissue and hyaline degeneration, atrophy, and inflammation in muscle tissue. Additionally, 8-OHdG levels of the liver and muscle tissues at 120 days' fasting were more severe according to 70 days' fasting. Finally, blood, the liver, and muscle tissues may be helpful to assess the impacts of fasting and fasting stress in rainbow trout."
0,"Lysin motif (LysM) is involved in chitin, peptidoglycan and other structurally-related oligosaccharides recognition and binding, and it is important for the biological processes of responsing to bacterial and viral infections and pathogen defense. LysM is also a widely spread protein, ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, including bacteria, plants and mammals. However, research of LysM in teleosts especially in marine fish was rarely scarce. In the present study, four novel LysM domain-containing proteins in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), named as SmLysMd1, SmLysMd2, SmLysMd3, and SmLysMd4, were cloned and identified firstly. The full-length cDNA of SmLysMd1 was 1235 bp with a 678 bp ORF, capable of encoding a peptide of 225 amino acids. The complete cDNA sequence of SmLysMd2 was 1273 bp, and contained a 675 bp ORF, encoding a predicted protein of 224 amino acids. The full-length of SmLysMd3 cDNA was 2132 bp, containing a ORF of 987 bp, with a ORF of encoding 328 amino acids. The full-length SmLysMd4 cDNA was 1115 bp contained a 888 bp ORF, encoding 295 amino acids. And all the four predicated proteins contained a specific LYSM domain. Moreover, SmLysMd1 and SmLysMd2 belong to the intracellular non-secretory types, and SmLysMd3 and SmLysMd4 belong to the anchored transmembrane types. In addition, the four SmLysMd were ubiquitously expressed in all the examined tissues. Moreover, the SmLysMds levels were up-regulated in muscle and liver, and had a reduce tendency immediately in different degree following Vibrio vulnificus challenge, indicating that the turbot LysM could be participant in the immune responses to bacterial infections. The present result of LysM in turbot for the first time in a marine fish will provide foundation knowledge for the functions studies of LysM in immune responses. Further studies should be carried out to better understand their immune mechanism in turbot and other teleosts."
0,"In this work, chicken and fish peptides were obtained using the proteolytic enzymes α-Chymotrypsin and Flavourzyme. The muscle was hydrolyzed for 4 h, and the resulting peptides were evaluated. Hydrolysates were produced from Argentine croaker (Umbrina canosai) with a degree of hydrolysis (DH) of 25.9 and 27.6% and from chicken (Gallus domesticus) with DH of 17.8 and 20.6% for Flavourzyme and α-Chymotrypsin, respectively. Membrane ultrafiltration was used to separate fish and chicken hydrolysates from Flavourzyme and α-Chymotrypsin based on molecular weight cutoff of >1,000, <1,000 and >500, and <500 Da, to produce fractions (F1,000, F1,000-500, and F500) with antioxidant activity. Fish hydrolysates produced with Flavourzyme (FHF) and α-Chymotrypsin showed 60.8 and 50.9% of peptides with a molecular weight of <3 kDa in its composition, respectively. To chicken hydrolysates produced with Flavourzyme and α-Chymotrypsin (CHC) was observed 83 and 92.4% of peptides with a molecular weight of <3 kDa. The fraction that showed, in general, higher antioxidant potential was F1,000 from FHF. When added 40 mg/mL of FHF and CHC, 93 and 80% of lipid oxidation in ground beef homogenates was inhibited, respectively. The composition of amino acids indicated higher amino acids hydrophobic content and amino acids containing sulfuric residues for FHF, which showed antioxidant potential."
0,"Selenium (Se), a fundamental element of nutrigenomic science in fish nutrition, was used to investigate its impact on selenoproteome expression and Se regulation in tilapia. Different concentrations (T<sub>1</sub> - 0, T<sub>2</sub> - 0.5, T<sub>3</sub> - 1.0 and T<sub>4</sub> - 2.0 mg/kg of feed) of dietary nano-Se were incorporated in the diets of monosex Nile tilapia. A total of 180 tilapia fingerlings with initial weight (15.73 ± 0.05 g) were stocked in 150 L capacity FRP tanks categorized into four diet groups with triplicate each for a feeding trial of 90 days. At the end of first, second and third months of the feeding trial, gill, liver, kidney and muscle tissues were harvested to evaluate the effect on the kinetics of Se bioaccumulation and assimilation as well as immune-regulated selenoprotein transcripts (GPx2, SelJ, SelL, SelK, SelS, SelW and Sepp1a) and their synthesis factors (SPS1 and Scly). The findings depicted that significantly (p < 0.05) higher weight gain was found in the diet supplemented with 1.0 mg/kg of nano-Se. The theory of second-order polynomial regression supported the same. The liver showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher Se accumulation and concentration factor among the harvested tissues in a different timeline. All the selected immune-regulated selenoproteins and synthesis factors in different fish tissues showed significantly (p < 0.05) up-regulation in the diet supplemented with 1.0 mg/kg of nano-Se for the second month. Therefore, the present findings suggested that the supplementation of nano-Se could be more effective for improved growth, better selenium regulation and expression of immune-regulated selenoproteins in the fish model."
0,"In the present study, metal (As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn) accumulation and expression of genes involved in metal metabolism (metallothioneins, ATP7A and CTR1) were evaluated in gills and muscle of the fish Hyphessobrycon luetkenii living in the João Dias creek, a site historically (~1870-1996) contaminated with a metal mixture associated with copper mining (Minas do Camaquã, southern Brazil). Fish were collected in a metal impacted site of the João Dias creek and kept in a cage at this site (PP fish) or translocated to a non-metal impacted reach of this creek (PC fish). Gill metal concentrations and metallothionein gene expression were lower in PC fish than in PP fish at any experimental time (24, 48 and 72 h). In muscle, no significant changes were observed. These findings indicate that metal accumulated in gills of wild fish chronically exposed to the metal mixture are more easily excreted than those accumulated in the muscle. In this case, expression of gene encoding for metallothionein is shown to play a key role in the regulation of metal accumulation in gills of H. luetkenii living in an area historically contaminated with a metal mixture associated with copper mining."
0,"The properties of film from fish protein isolate (FPI) prepared by prior washing followed by alkaline solubilization process (ASP) from red tilapia muscle were monitored during the storage of 20 days at 50% RH and 25°C, in comparison with those of films from washed mince. Lipid, heme iron and non-heme iron contents in FPI were decreased by 98.8, 36.8 and 91.9%, respectively in comparison with those of washed mince (p<0.05). Films from FPI had higher tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) than those from washed mince for both pH (3 and 11) used for film preparation (p<0.05). Film from FPI at pH 3 showed the highest TS, while that from washed mince at pH 11 had the lowest TS (p<0.05). Nevertheless, films from FPI had higher WVP than those from washed mince for both pH used (p<0.05). At the same pH used for film preparation (3 or 11), films from FPI showed the lower TBARS values than those from washed mince (p<0.05). Nevertheless, films from both FPI and washed mince had the higher TBARS values when pH 3 was used for film preparation, compared with pH 11 (p<0.05). Among all films, those from FPI prepared at pH 3 had the highest transparency and no yellow discoloration was observed during the storage of 20 days, in comparison with other films (p<0.05). Conversely, film from washed mince prepared at pH 3 had the higher increase in b*-value and ΔE*-value than other films. Therefore, FPI could serve as a potential material for film preparation with lower contents of lipid and prooxidants, thereby preventing the yellow discoloration of the fish myofibrillar protein-based film during extended storage."
0,"The present study was conducted to estimate the effects of dietary carbohydrates on muscle quality and the underlying mechanisms. Six isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were formulated to contain graded levels of carbohydrates (0%, 8%, 12%, 16%, 20% and 24%, respectively). These diets were named as C0, C8, C12, C16, C20 and C24, respectively. After a 10-week feeding trial, results showed that the muscle pH, liquid holding capacity (LHC) and hardness were significantly decreased by the increasing dietary carbohydrate levels. Dietary carbohydrates significantly decreased the muscle fibre diameter, and the highest value was found in the C0 group. Accumulated glycogen and degenerated mitochondrial cristae were observed in the C24 group. Significantly higher contents of protein carbonyls were observed in the C20 group and C24 group (P < 0.05). There was a significant decrease of mtDNA copy number in the C24 group compared with that in the C0 and C8 groups. The AMP/ATP ratio in muscle decreased first and then increased with the increasing dietary carbohydrate levels. The dietary incorporation of carbohydrate significantly reduced the expression of opa1, pygm and genes involved in myogenesis (myf5 and myog). Meanwhile, proteolysis-related genes (murf-1, mafbx, capn2 and ctsl), pro-inflammatory cytokines (il-6 and tnf-α) and mstn were significantly up-regulated. In the C24 group, significant increase of phosphorylation of AMPK (Thr172), up-regulation of PGC-1α and GLUT4 were observed, while the phosphorylation level of S6 (Ser235/236) was significantly decreased. It was concluded that excessive dietary carbohydrate level (24%) had negative impacts on mitochondria function and promoted glycogen accumulation, and thereafter influenced the muscle quality of olive flounder. The activation of AMPK as well as the upregulation of PGC-1α and GLUT4 was the key mechanism."
0,"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have unique properties purported to influence several aspects of metabolism, including energy expenditure and protein function. Supplementing with n-3 PUFAs may increase whole-body resting metabolic rate (RMR), by enhancing Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (NKA) activity and reducing the efficiency of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) activity by inducing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak-pump cycle. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of fish oil (FO) on RMR, substrate oxidation, and skeletal muscle SERCA and NKA pump function in healthy older individuals. Subjects (n = 16 females; n = 8 males; 65 ± 1 years) were randomly assigned into groups supplemented with either olive oil (OO) (5 g/day) or FO (5 g/day) containing 2 g/day eicosapentaenoic acid and 1 g/day docosahexaenoic acid for 12 weeks. Participants visited the laboratory for RMR and substrate oxidation measurements after an overnight fast at weeks 0 and 12. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken during weeks 0 and 12 for analysis of NKA and SERCA function and protein content. There was a main effect of time with decrease in RMR (5%) and fat oxidation (18%) in both the supplementation groups. The kinetic parameters of SERCA and NKA maximal activity, as well as the expression of SR and NKA proteins, were not affected after OO and FO supplementation. In conclusion, these results suggest that FO supplementation is not effective in altering RMR, substrate oxidation, and skeletal muscle SERCA and NKA protein levels and activities, in healthy older men and women."

1,"Two groups of 12 rats each were fed 20% casein (C) or FP for 2 months. The total antioxidant status of blood and organs (liver, kidney and heart) was measured by the KRL test. Antioxidant enzyme activities (G-Px, G-Red, and SOD) and antioxidant substances (GSH, NO) were determined in organs, and vitamin C in plasma."
2,"FP lowered blood pressure in SH rats, but not in SH-STZ. Blood and plasma antioxidant status increased 35% and 9%, respectively, with FP in SH-STZ compared to SH rats; when compared to C, these values were more enhanced. SOD activity values were elevated with FP in SH-STZ rats, compared to the C diet, regardless of organ. Higher kidney NO and heart GSH values were noted in SH-STZ rats than SH. In SH rats fed FP, the GSH value was 2.26 times higher in liver, and NO was 3 times higher in heart. Higher NO was noted in kidney (1.84 times) and heart (1.91 times), GSH in heart (1.79 times), and vitamin C in plasma (+46%) in SH-STZ rats with FP than with C."

0,"Muscle accretion is affected by the difference between protein synthesis and its degradation. Studies on different species revealed that muscle proteolysis is mediated by different pathways including the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in which the ubiquitin protein ligases play an important role. These muscle atrophy associated ligases were not well studied in tilapia. In this study, we characterized the ubiquitin protein ligases MuRF1/2/3, Atrogin-1 and F-box25, members of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, and their expressions in the muscle of starved, fed, refed, and control fish. Sequences of these genes revealed presence of Ring finger, B-box, and Cos domains in all MuRF genes, as well as F-box domain in Atrogin-1 and F-box25 genes. Real-time qPCR data analysis showed that expression of MuRF1/2/3, Atrogin-1, F-box25, and proteasome complex genes was significantly upregulated in starved fish compared to fed fish. Concurrently, the proteasome activity was 1.7-folds elevated in the starved fish compared to fed fish. These results confirm the important role of these genes in muscle degradation and suggest potential usage as markers of muscle accretion in tilapia."
0,"An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of partial replacement of fish meal by soy protein concentrate (SPC) on the growth performance, immune responses, intestine morphology and relation gene expression of intestinal inflammation for juvenile hybrid grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus ♀ × Epinephelus lanceolatus ♂) (initial weight 12.5 ± 0.00 g). Eight isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets (48.61% protein and 11.17% lipid) were formulated by replacing 0% (the control), 11%, 22%, 33%, 44%, 55%, 66%, and 77% of fish meal (FM) with SPC, respectively (the eight dietary be named FM, S11, S22, S33, S44, S55, S66, and S77, respectively). With the replacement level increased, the final body weight, weight gain ratio (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR), and survival rate of fish were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) compared with the group FM. By contrast, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of fish was significantly increased (P < 0.05) when the replacement level up to 44%. Partial FM replacement by SPC (ranging from 11% to 77%) substantially reduced (P < 0.05) the serum total protein, albumin, and total cholesterol contents compared with the group FM. Liver total superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase activities, and total antioxidant capacity showed the same trend of gradual increase first and then decrease. Their highest values were found in the replacement levels of 55%, 33%, 22%, and 55% and were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the control group. The lowest malondialdehyde content was observed in group S77 and was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the control group. The complements C3 and C4 contents of fish fed with experimental diets (replacement level ranged from 11% to 66%) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the group FM. The liver lysozyme activity of the control group was the lowest and was significantly lower than that of other dietary treatments (P < 0.05). Villus length and muscle thickness in the intestine of fish were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than other groups when the replacement level exceeded 44%. With dietary replacement levels increased, the TLR22, MyD88, p65, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-12P40 and INF-γ) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β, IL-10, epinecidin, MHCIIβ and hepcidin) mRNA levels in the proximal intestine were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05). The TLR22, MyD88, p65, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-12P40 and INF-γ) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β, IL-10, MHCIIβ and hepcidin) mRNA levels in the mid intestine were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05). The mRNA levels of TLR22, anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-12P40, INF-γ) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β, IL-10, epinecidin, MHCIIβ and hepcidin) in the distal intestine were significantly down-regulated (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of MyD88 and p65 mRNA were showed a tend increased first and then decreased, and the highest values were observed in group S33 and S55 (P < 0.05), respectively. Based on the present work, the correlation between WGR and FM replacement level with SPC was described using the broken-line model, which estimated the optimum FM replacement to 37.23% for juvenile hybrid grouper dietary."
0,"Impacts of atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) on the properties of muscle protein and performance of extracted crude enzyme of hairtail (Trichiurus Lepturus) fish have been evaluated. A decrease in extracted crude enzyme activity with increasing the ACP treatment time has been found, and the highest reduction (p < 0.05) value of 0.035 units/mg proteins was obtained after 240 s. A considerable increase in the carbonyl content in the treated sample for about three times higher than the control sample was found, and a decrease of total sulfhydryl content to 0.34 nmol/mg protein. Texture profile analysis, water holding capacity, and the color properties of the muscle protein improved significantly in the samples treated with ACP. SDS-PAGE pattern showed an increase in the band intensity of cross-linked myosin heavy chains and actin proteins. Based on these outcomes, ACP could play a significant role as a promising non-thermal method to prolong the shelf-life of hairtail fish."
0,"High saturated fat (HF-S) diets increase intramyocellular lipid, an effect ameliorated by omega-3 fatty acids in vitro and in vivo, though little is known about sex- and muscle fiber type-specific effects. We compared effects of standard chow, HF-S, and 7.5% HF-S replaced with fish oil (HF-FO) diets on the metabolic profile and lipid metabolism gene and protein content in red (soleus) and white (extensor digitorum longus) muscles of male and female C57BL/6 mice (n = 9-12/group). Weight gain was similar in HF-S- and HF-FO-fed groups. HF-S feeding increased mesenteric fat mass and lipid marker, Oil Red O, in red and mixed muscle; HF-FO increased interscapular brown fat mass. Compared to chow, HF-S and HF-FO increased expression of genes regulating triacylglycerol synthesis and fatty acid transport, HF-S suppressed genes and proteins regulating fatty acid oxidation, whereas HF-FO increased oxidative genes, proteins and enzymes and lipolytic gene content, whilst suppressing lipogenic genes. In comparison to HF-S, HF-FO further increased fat transporters, markers of fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial content, and reduced lipogenic genes. No diet-by-sex interactions were observed. Neither diet influenced fiber type composition. However, some interactions between muscle type and diet were observed. HF-S induced changes in triacylglycerol synthesis and lipogenic genes in red, but not white, muscle, and mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative genes were suppressed by HF-S and increased by HF-FO in red muscle only. In conclusion, HF-S feeding promotes lipid storage in red muscle, an effect abrogated by the fish oil, which increases mediators of lipolysis, oxidation and thermogenesis while inhibiting lipogenic genes. Greater storage and synthesis, and lower oxidative genes in red, but not white, muscle likely contribute to lipid accretion encountered in red muscle. Despite several gender-dimorphic genes, both sexes exhibited a similar HF-S-induced metabolic and gene expression profile; likewise fish oil was similarly protective in both sexes. "
0,"Viperin is an anti-viral protein, induced by viral infection. In this study, we examined whether over-expression of viperin in fish muscle could inhibit bacterial growth. We first obtained the cDNA sequence of tilapia viperin, through RT-PCR-mediated cloning and sequencing. The cDNA sequence was similar to those of several fish viperins in GenBank, and it was predicted to encode the conserved domain of radical S-adenosylmethionine superfamily proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that tilapia viperin was most closely related to viperin of Sciaenops ocellatus, Coreoperca kawamebari, and C. whiteheadi. Expression of tilapia viperin was significantly up-regulated in the kidney, liver, spleen, and gills upon challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and poly(I:C) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Injection of Vibrio vulnificus (204) and Streptococcus agalactiae (SA47) bacteria into tilapia resulted in significant induction of viperin expression in the whole body, kidney, liver, and spleen. Electrotransfer of a viperin-expressing plasmid into zebrafish muscles decreased bacterial numbers and altered expression of immune-related genes. These data indicate that such altered expression may account for the improvement in bacterial clearance following electroporation of viperin, suggesting that fish viperin has antiviral and antibacterial activities."
0,"Age-related muscle wasting can compromise functional abilities of the elderly. Protein intake stimulates muscle protein synthesis; however, ageing muscle is more resistant to stimuli. This double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial is one of the first registered studies to evaluate the effects of a supplement of marine protein hydrolysate (MPH) on measures of physical function and strength. Eighty-six older adults received nutritional supplements containing 3 g of MPH or a placebo for up to 12 months. Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), grip strength and gait speed were measured, and dietary intake was registered at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. No difference was found between the intervention and control groups in mean change in SPPB (independent sample <i>t</i>-test, <i>p</i> = 0.41) or regarding time trend in SPPB, grip strength, or gait speed (linear mixed model). The participants in our study were well functioning, causing a ceiling effect in SPPB. Further, they had sufficient protein intake and were physically active. Differences in physical function between those completing the intervention and the dropouts might also have created bias in the results. We recommend that future studies of MPH be carried out on a more frail or malnourished population."
0,"Hypertension is the most widespread risk factor for many serious cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a crucial role in cardiovascular physiological regulation by converting angiotensin I to a potent vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II. Hence, the inhibition of ACE is a key target for antihypertensive activity. Recently, potent antihypertensive peptides have been purified widely by enzymatic hydrolysis of muscle protein, skin collagen, and gelatin of many different kinds of marine fishes. Marine fish-derived bioactive peptides can be developed as antihypertensive components in functional foods or nutraceuticals. This contribution presents an overview of the ACE inhibitory peptides derived from marine fishes and discusses their future prospects to be used as potential drug candidates for preventing and treating high blood pressure."
0,"The characterization of the expression and regulation of growth-related genes in the muscles of Chinese perch is of great interest to aquaculturists because of the commercial value of the species. The transcriptome annotation of the skeletal muscles is a crucial step in muscle growth-related gene analysis. In this study, we generated 52 504 230 reads of mRNA sequence data from the fast muscles of the Chinese perch by using Solexa/Illumina RNA-seq. Twenty-one amino acid transporter genes were annotated by searching protein and gene ontology databases, and postprandial changes in their transcript abundance were assayed after administering a single satiating meal to Chinese perch juveniles (body mass, approximately 100 g), following fasting for 1 week. The gut content of the Chinese perch increased significantly after 1 h and remained high for 6 h following the meal and emptied within 48-96 h. Expression of eight amino acid transporter genes was assayed in the fast muscles through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h. Among the genes, five transporter transcripts were markedly up-regulated within 1 h of refeeding, indicating that they may be potential candidate genes involved in the rapid-response signaling system regulating fish myotomal muscle growth. These genes display coordinated regulation favoring the resumption of myogenesis responding to feeding. "
0,"The pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) technique was used, for the first time, to obtain protein extracts with antioxidant activity from side streams (muscle, heads, viscera, skin, and tailfins) of gilthead sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) in order to give added value to these underutilized matrices. Extraction conditions previously optimized for sea bass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>) side streams were applied. Protein recovery percentages were 22% (muscle), 33% (heads), 78% (viscera), 24% (skin), and 26% (tailfins), which represented an increase of 1.2-4.5-fold compared to control samples (extraction by stirring). The SDS-PAGE profiles revealed that PLE-assisted extraction influenced protein molecular weight distribution of the obtained extracts. PLE conditions also allowed increasing the antioxidant capacity measured by both Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC; 1.3-2.4 fold) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC; 1.9-6.4) assays for all fish extracts. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-qTOF-MS) were used to investigate the presence of toxic metals and mycotoxins in sea bream side streams. The levels of As, Hg, Cd, and Pb were below those established by authorities for fish muscle for human consumption (except for Cd in viscera samples). Through a nontargeted screening approach, no mycotoxins or related metabolites were detected for all sea bream side streams. This study contributes to the research on the valorization of fish processing side streams using environmentally friendly technology."
0,"Allergy to fish represents one of the most prevalent causes for severe food-allergic reactions. Therefore, food authorities in different countries have implemented mandatory labeling of fish in pre-packed foods. Detection of fish proteins in food has previously been based on the use of patient serum. In the present study, a novel sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantitation of fish in food matrixes has been developed and validated, using a polyclonal rabbit anti-cod parvalbumin antibody for capture and a biotinylated conjugate of the same antibody for detection. By employing the ubiquitous muscle protein parvalbumin as target the method succeeds to detect a variety of fish. However, the ELISA is specific for fish and does not cross-react with other species. Recoveries ranged from 68-138% in typical food matrixes, while the intra- and inter-assay precisions were <12% and <19%, respectively. The sensitivity of the cod parvalbumin ELISA with a limit of detection of 0.01 mg parvalbumin/kg food, about 5 mg fish/kg food, seems sufficient to detect fish protein traces in foods at levels low enough to minimize the risk for fish allergic consumers."
0,"Molecular oscillators exist in peripheral tissues like pacemaker cells. Food intake is a dominant zeitgeber for peripheral clocks in vertebrates. Fasting is a physiological stress that elicits well-known metabolic adaptations, however, little is known about the effects of the rhythmic expression of clock components in skeletal muscle following short-term fasting in goldfish. Here, we characterized the molecular clock components and their daily transcription in COSINOR, and assessed the effect of 7-day fasting on the circadian patterns of the candidate genes expression in goldfish skeletal muscle. For the core clock genes, clock, bmal1a, cry1, cry2, cry3, per1, per2 and per3 showed circadian rhythmicity in fed goldfish, but not for bmal1a, cry2 and per1 in the fasted state. Of the 8 candidate functional genes analyzed, igf1, igf2 and igfbp2 showed circadian rhythmicity in the fed state, but circadian pattern was only observed for mRNA of myog, igfbp2 and mstn in fasted goldfish. Additionally, Spelman's correlation analysis showed the circadian expression of the myog and mstn presented positive and negative correlation with the transcription pattern of clock and per2 genes in fasted goldfish, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the peripheral clocks might be reset to respond rapidly to withholding of food in teleost skeletal muscle."
0,"Mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) is an important economic fish in China. Viral and bacterial diseases seriously affect the artificial culture of S. chuatsi. As a carnivorous fish, artificial feed domestication is also an important means to improve the scale of S. chuatsi culture. Therefore, the study of immunology and digestive physiology is very important to the industrial development of S. chuatsi. In this work, we analyzed the expression and function of the S. chuatsi leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (Sc-lect2) gene on a basis of next generation, single-molecule long-read sequencing. Sc-lect2 was mainly expressed in the liver but barely expressed in the gill, skin, muscle, kidney, head kidney, brain, stomach, and intestine. When the fish were infected with infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus and challenged with lipopolysaccharide and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, Sc-lect2 expression significantly increased by about 40, 17, and 7-fold, respectively, compared with unstimulated samples. We also found that Sc-lect2 increases by approximately 8-fold after the fish are fed an artificial diet. These results show that mandarin fish liver can not only digest food but also express specific immune genes. Changes in the diet can cause the differential expression of Sc-lect2 genes. Four Sc-lect2 interaction genes were differentially expressed in the skin or blood. Interestingly, miR-145-3p could inhibit Sc-lect2 gene expression by targeting its coding sequence region. One CpG island in the promoter region showed a high level of methylation, suggesting that high methylation does not affect Sc-lect2 gene expression in the liver."
0,"Spinibarbus hollandi is an economically important fish species in southern China. This fish is known to have nutritional and medicinal properties; however, its farming is limited by its slow growth rate. In the present study, we observed that a compensatory growth phenomenon could be induced by adequate refeeding following 7 days of fasting in S. hollandi. To understand the starvation response and compensatory growth mechanisms in this fish, the muscle transcriptomes of S. hollandi under control, fasting, and refeeding conditions were profiled using next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques."
1,"More than 4.45 × 10<sup>8</sup> quality-filtered 150-base-pair Illumina reads were obtained from all nine muscle samples. De novo assemblies yielded a total of 156,735 unigenes, among which 142,918 (91.18%) could be annotated in at least one available database. After 7 days of fasting, 2422 differentially expressed genes were detected, including 1510 up-regulated genes and 912 down-regulated genes. Genes involved in fat, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism were significantly up-regulated, and genes associated with the cell cycle, DNA replication, and immune and cellular structures were inhibited during fasting. After refeeding, 84 up-regulated genes and 16 down-regulated genes were identified. Many genes encoding the components of myofibers were significantly up-regulated. Histological analysis of muscle verified the important role of muscle hypertrophy in compensatory growth."
2,"In the present work, we reported the transcriptome profiles of S. hollandi muscle under different conditions. During fasting, the genes involved in the mobilization of stored energy were up-regulated, while the genes associated with growth were down-regulated. After refeeding, muscle hypertrophy contributed to the recovery of growth. The results of this study may help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the starvation response and compensatory growth."
0,"This study evaluated the efficacy of replacing dietary fish oil (FO) with vegetable oils (virgin coconut and corn oil) on enzyme activities (glycolytic, oxidative and lipid metabolites), mRNA expression of lipid metabolic genes and histomorphology of liver and intestine in O. niloticus. O. niloticus (6.07 ± 0.07 g) was fed six experimental diets where fish oil (FO) served as the control diet, and then was supplemented by dietary oils; virgin coconut oil (VCO) {3%FO + 3%VCO; 3FVCO}, and corn oil (CO) {3%FO + 3%CO; 3FCO}, 6%VCO (VCO), 6%CO (CO) and 6%VO {3%VCO + 3%CO; VO}. Growth performances measured indicated fish fed diet 3FCO had higher weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate (SGR). Fish fed diet 3FCO recorded the highest activities in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), citrate synthase (CS), cytochrome coxidase (COX), malic enzymes (ME) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) respectively. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) was upregulated in groups fed diets 3FVCO and 3FCO. Also, groups fed diet VCO and CO expressed highly in LPL, whereas, elongase of very long-chain fatty acids (ELOVL-5) was not influenced by the lipid sources. Histological representations in the liver were highly impacted in vegetable diets where lipid accumulation was higher except those fed VCO. However, in the digestive tract from distal to middle and posterior, the same group (VCO) exhibited altered morphological structure as those fed diet 3FCO were similar to FO. The study shows that, corn oil in diets relates positively to growth and enzymatic activities which becomes evident in their depositions in liver and functional intestinal tracts. This study indicates dietary alternatives may cause alterations in lipid metabolic pathways (LPL and SCD1) involved in fatty acid transport. As such, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) rich diets (CO) based on this study results increases metabolic activities involving especially the production, distribution and consumption of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in O. niloticus."
0,"In this study, a new continuous muscle cell line, LYCMS (large yellow croaker muscle cell line), derived from the muscle tissue of larva of large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) was developed with modified DMEM/F12 medium at 27 °C. The muscle cell line could be passaged at different ratios for different growth rates. Karyotype analysis showed that a large proportion of LYCMS cells had 48 chromosomes. The proliferation of LYCMS cell line could be affected by mammalian growth factors such as human basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). GFP expression experiments indicated that the LYCMS cell line could be used for exogenous genes' expression. Different virus response-related genes tested in this study showed diverse change types in expression before and after (0-24 h) polycytidylic acid (poly I: C) challenge of LYCMS cells. This is the first study of virus response signaling pathways of large yellow croaker based on the muscle cell line. The results showed that compared with the in vivo experiments, the use of the LYCMS cell line for immune research is more convenient, efficient, and rapid. By using this model, we demonstrated that MDA5-IPS1-TRAF6-NFκB-cytokines, MDA5-IPS1-TRAF3-IRF3-interferon or TLR22-TRIF-IRF3-interferon, TLR8-MyD88-NFκB-cytokines, and TLR3-TRIF-IRF3-interferon pathways were able to response to poly I: C challenge in the muscle cell line of large yellow croaker."
0,"Myostatin (MSTN) negatively regulates skeletal muscle growth, and its activity is inhibited by the binding of MSTN propeptide (MSTNpro), the N-terminal domain of proMSTN that is proteolytically cleaved from the proMSTN. Partial sequences from the N-terminal side of MSTNpro have shown to be sufficient to inhibit MSTN activity. In this study, to determine the minimum size of flatfish MSTNpro for MSTN inhibition, various truncated forms of flatfish MSTNpro with N-terminal maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion were expressed in E. coli and purified. MSTNpro regions consisting of residues 45-68, -69, and -70 with MBP fusion suppressed MSTN activity with a potency comparable to that of full-sequence flatfish MSTNpro in a pGL3-(CAGA)12-luciferase reporter assay. Even though the MSTN-inhibitory potency was about 1,000-fold lower, the flatfish MSTNpro region containing residues 45-65 (MBP-Pro45-65) showed MSTN-inhibitory capacity but not the MBP-Pro45-64, indicating that the region 45-65 is the minimum domain required for MSTN binding and suppression of its activity. To examine the in vivo effect of MBP-fused, truncated flatfish MSTNpro, MBP-Pro45-70-His6 (20 mg/kg body wt) was subcutaneously injected 5 times for 14 days in mice. Body wt gain and bone mass were not affected by the administration. Grip strength and swimming time were significantly enhanced at 7 d after the administration. At 14 d, the effect on grip strength disappeared, and the extent of the effect on swimming time significantly diminished. The presence of antibody against MBP-Pro45-70-His6 was observed at both 7 and 14 d after the administration with the titer value at 14 d being much greater than that at 7 d, suggesting that antibodies against MBP-Pro45-70-His6 neutralized the MSTN-inhibitory effect of MBP-Pro45-70-His6. We, thus, examined the MSTN-inhibitory capacity and in vivo effect of flatfish MSTNpro region 45-65 peptide (Pep45-65-NH2), which was predicted to have no immunogenicity in silico analysis. Pep45-65-NH2 suppressed MSTN activity with a potency similar to that of MBP-Pro45-65 but did not suppress GDF11, or activin A. Pep45-65-NH2 blocked MSTN-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. The administration of Pep45-65 (20 mg/kg body wt, 5 times for 2 weeks) increased the body wt gain with a greater gain at 14 d than at 7 d and muscle wt. Grip strength and swimming time were also significantly enhanced by the administration. Antibody titer against Pep45-65 was not detected. In conclusion, current results indicate that MSTN-inhibitory proteins with heterologous fusion partner may not be effective in suppressing MSTN activity in vivo due to an immune response against the proteins. Current results also show that the region of flatfish MSTNpro consisting of 45-65 (Pep45-65) can suppress mouse MSTN activity and increase muscle mass and function without invoking an immune response, implying that Pep45-65 would be a potential agent to enhance skeletal muscle growth and function in animals or to treat muscle atrophy caused by various clinical conditions."
0,"Six groups of grass carp (average weight 266.9 ± 0.6 g) were fed diets containing 197, 385, 770, 1082, 1436 and 1795 mg choline/kg, for 8 weeks. Fish growth, and muscle nutrient (protein, fat and amino acid) content of young grass carp were significantly improved by appropriate dietary choline. Furthermore, muscle hydroxyproline concentration, lactate content and shear force were improved by optimum dietary choline supplementation. However, the muscle pH value, cooking loss and cathepsins activities showed an opposite trend. Additionally, optimum dietary choline supplementation attenuated muscle oxidative damage in grass carp. The muscle antioxidant enzyme (catalase and glutathione reductase did not change) activities and glutathione content were enhanced by optimum dietary choline supplementation. Muscle cooking loss was negatively correlated with antioxidant enzyme activities and glutathione content. At the gene level, these antioxidant enzymes, as well as the targets of rapamycin, casein kinase 2 and NF-E2-related factor 2 transcripts in fish muscle were always up-regulated by suitable choline. However, suitable choline significantly decreased Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 a (Keap1a) and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 b (Keap1b) mRNA levels in muscle. In conclusion, suitable dietary choline enhanced fish flesh quality, and the decreased cooking loss was due to the elevated antioxidant status that may be regulated by Nrf2 signaling. "
0,"Although teleost fish developed acquired immunity firstly in evolution, innate immunity is still very important for them.

1,"We report the cloning and expression analysis of two PGRPs (Ccpgrp5 and Ccpgrp6) from common carp (Cyprinus carpio L). The Ccpgrp5 gene encodes a protein of 199 amino acid (aa) with PGRP domain, Ami_2 domain and four Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites required for amidase activity, but without signal peptide and transmembrane domain. The Ccpgrp6 gene encodes a protein of 446 aa with PGRP domain, Ami_2 domain, signal peptide, five Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites required for amidase activity and two sites for N-glycosylation. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CcPGRP5 and CcPGRP6 are closely related to Ctenopharyngodon idella and Danio rerio. Ccpgrp5 and Ccpgrp6 were expressed in all tissues examined including liver, spleen, muscle, oral epithelium, head kidney, gill, skin, gonad, brain, foregut and hindgut and showed different distribution characteristics. During the embryonic and early larval developmental stages of common carp, Ccpgrp6 was detected to be highly expressed at 10 days post fertilization(dpf) and 36 dpf, while Ccpgrp5 were hardly detected using Real-time quantitative PCR. After being challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila, Ccpgrp5 in adult common carp was induced and up-regulated in all the tissues, especially in gill and spleen, but not in head kidney, while Ccpgrp6 was up-regulated in all the tissues, especially in liver, head kidney and gill. The varied expression profiling of Ccpgrp5 and Ccpgrp6 indicated they had different roles in the host immune response."
2,"These results indicated the two PGRPs, especially Ccpgrp6, played an important role in the immune defense of common carp during larva development and against Aeromonas hydrophila, providing insight to further exploration of protecting fish against bacteria infectious disease."
0,"Resveratrol is a naturally occurring antioxidant that has been widely studied in mammals due to its potential to extend lifespan. However, antioxidants may also limit protein damage and therefore reduce rates of protein degradation, providing a potential avenue for enhancing growth in an aquaculture setting. The present study tested the hypotheses that in Southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma, resveratrol would decrease protein carbonylation and 4-HNE (indicators of protein and lipid oxidative damage, respectively), levels of ubiquitinylation and LC3 (indicators of non-lysosomal and lysosomal protein degradation, respectively), while having no effect on S6K activation (indicator of protein synthesis). These effects were predicted to increase growth rate. Mitochondrial volume density was also examined since resveratrol may lead to the proliferation of mitochondria, which are the principal source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative damage. Juvenile fish (n=142) were fed a control diet or a diet supplemented with 600 μg resveratrol per g of food for 16 weeks. Fish treated with resveratrol had a 9% greater length and 33% greater body mass than control fish after 16 weeks. Additionally, there was lower protein carbonylation and lipid 4-HNE within the muscle tissues of treated fish, indicating decreased oxidative damage, and reduced protein ubiquitinylation in the resveratrol fed flounder, indicating less protein degradation. However, there was not a significant difference in LC3, S6K activation, or mitochondrial volume density. These results suggest that resveratrol has positive effects on growth due to its antioxidant properties that reduce non-lysosomal protein degradation."
0,"The tolerance of fish to fasting offers a model to study the regulatory mechanisms and changes produced when feeding is restored. Gilthead sea bream juveniles were exposed to a 21-days fasting period followed by 2 h to 7-days refeeding. Fasting provoked a decrease in body weight, somatic indexes, and muscle gene expression of members of the Gh/Igf system, signaling molecules (akt, tor and downstream effectors), proliferation marker pcna, myogenic regulatory factors, myostatin, and proteolytic molecules such as cathepsins or calpains, while most ubiquitin-proteasome system members increased or remained stable. In bone, downregulated expression of Gh/Igf members and osteogenic factors was observed, whereas expression of the osteoclastic marker ctsk was increased. Refeeding recovered the expression of Gh/Igf system, myogenic and osteogenic factors in a sequence similar to that of development. Akt and Tor phosphorylation raised at 2 and 5 h post-refeeding, much faster than its gene expression increased, which occurred at day 7. The expression in bone and muscle of the inhibitor myostatin (mstn2) showed an inverse profile suggesting an inter-organ coordination that needs to be further explored in fish. Overall, this study provides new information on the molecules involved in the musculoskeletal system remodeling during the early stages of refeeding in fish."
0,"MAF1 is a global suppressor of RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription, and is conserved from yeast to human. Growing evidence supports the involvement of MAF1 in the immune response of mammals, but its biological functions in fish are unknown. We isolated and characterized <i>Maf1</i> from the olive flounder <i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i> (<i>PoMaf1</i>). The coding region of <i>PoMaf1</i> comprised 738 bp encoding a 245-amino-acid protein. The deduced PoMAF1 amino acid sequence shared features with those of MAF1 orthologues from vertebrates. <i>PoMaf1</i> mRNA was detected in all tissues examined, and the levels were highest in eye and muscle tissue. The <i>PoMaf1</i> mRNA level increased during early development. In addition, the <i>PoMaf1</i> transcript level decreased during viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection of flounder hirame natural embryo (HINAE) cells. To investigate the role of <i>PoMaf1</i> in VHSV infection, single-cell-derived <i>PoMaf1</i> knockout HINAE cells were generated using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated-9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system, and cell clones with complete disruption of <i>PoMaf1</i> were selected. <i>PoMaf1</i> disruption increased the VHSV glycoprotein (G) mRNA levels during VHSV infection of HINAE cells, implicating PoMAF1 in the immune response to VSHV infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize fish <i>Maf1</i>, which may play a role in the response to viral infection."
0,"Many genes related to muscle growth modulate myoblast proliferation and differentiation and promote muscle hypertrophy. MyoD is a myogenic determinant that contributes to myoblast determination, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) interacts with MyoD to regulate muscle hypertrophy and muscle mass. In this study, we aimed to assess DNA methylation and mRNA expression patterns of MyoD and IGF-I during different developmental stages of Japanese flounder, and to examine the relationship between MyoD and IGF-I gene. DNA and RNA were extracted from muscles, and DNA methylation of MyoD and IGF-I promoter and exons was detected by bisulfite sequencing. The relative expression of MyoD and IGF-I was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. IGF-I was measured by radioimmunoassay. Interestingly, the lowest expression of MyoD and IGF-I emerged at larva stage, and the mRNA expression was negatively associated with methylation. We hypothesized that many skeletal muscle were required to complete metamorphosis; thus, the expression levels of MyoD and IGF-I genes increased from larva stage and then decreased. The relative expression levels of MyoD and IGF-I exhibited similar patterns, suggesting that MyoD and IGF-I regulated muscle growth through combined effects. Changes in the concentrations of IGF-I hormone were similar to those of IGF-I gene expression. Our results the mechanism through which MyoD and IGF-I regulate muscle development and demonstrated that MyoD interacted with IGF-I to regulate muscle growth during different developmental stages."
0,"Numerous embryonic ice crystals are generated in water at the moment of freezing. These crystals grow and merge together to form an ice block that can be generally observed. Antifreeze protein (AFP) is capable of binding to the embryonic ice crystals, inhibiting such an ice block formation. Fish-derived AFP additionally binds to membrane lipid bilayers to prolong the lifetime of cells. These unique abilities of AFP have been studied extensively for the development of advanced techniques, such as ice recrystallization inhibitors, freeze-tolerant gels, cell preservation fluids, and high-porosity ceramics, for which mass-preparation method of the quality product of AFP utilizing fish muscle homogenates made a significant contribution. In this chapter, we present both fundamental and advanced information of fish AFPs that have been especially discovered from mid-latitude sea area, which will provide a hint to develop more advanced techniques applicable in both medical and industrial fields."
0,"The aim of this study is to identify the protein indicator of freshness of Coregonus peled using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) methods. Samples were obtained prior to (control group) and 2, 4, 6, and 8 days after refrigerated storage for quality and proteomics analysis. Three proteins were found to have significant differential abundance in sample groups during the refrigerated storage, including l-lactate dehydrogenase, adenylate kinase isoenzyme 1, and myosin heavy chain, which were associated with freshness changes of C. peled. The freshness of C. peled fish during the refrigerated storage can be differentiated from the comparison of the specific proteins. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The changes of food quality pose not only the relative economical loses but also the potential implications on consumer's health. Proteomics can represent a powerful tool to explore potential biomarkers that may be related to meat quality defects. The identification of key protein biomarkers linked to freshness of Coregonus peled allows to monitor the response of the food matrix during storage and try to minimizes these defects."
0,"G protein-coupled receptors are critical regulators of diverse developmental processes such as oocyte maturation, fertilization, gastrulation, and organogenesis. To further study the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes, we cloned and characterized the orphan leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6), a stem cell marker in mammalian hair follicles, in medaka fish, Oryzias latipes. To examine the expression pattern of lgr6, we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) during embryogenesis. The expression of lgr6 was first detected as a band in the anterior part of the posterior brain vesicle in 0.5-1 day post fertilization (dpf) embryos. This band disappeared by 2 dpf, but new signals appeared in the otic vesicles bordering the original band and also detected in the nasal placode and posterior lateral line primordia. At later stages (3-5 dpf), lgr6 was widely expressed in the brain, otic vesicle, neuromasts, root of the pectoral fin, cranial cartilage, and gut. Then, we conducted more detailed expression analysis of lgr6 in adult gut using WISH and immunohistochemical staining. Lgr6-positive cells were detected in the crypt-like proliferative zone and in parts of the villus. We also performed RT-PCR of mRNAs from different tissues. The lgr6 mRNA was found highest in the kidney and gill. The transcript was also present in the brain, heart, liver, spleen, intestine, skeletal muscle, testis, and ovary, similar to that of mammalian LGR6. These results suggest that medaka lgr6 plays an important role in organ development during embryogenesis and serves as a good molecular marker for future studies of postembryonic organ-specific development in mammals."
0,"Fish muscle growth is important for the rapidly developing global aquaculture industry, particularly with respect to production and quality. Changes in muscle fibre size are accomplished by altering the balance between protein synthesis and proteolysis. However, our understanding regarding the effects of different protein sources on fish muscle proteins is still limited. Here we report on the proteomic profile of muscle fibre hyperplasia in grass carp fed only with whole faba bean. From the results, a total of 99 significantly changed proteins after muscle hyperplasia increase were identified (p < 0.05, ratio <0.5 or >2). Protein-protein interaction analysis demonstrated the presence of a network containing 56 differentially expressed proteins, and muscle fibre hyperplasia was closely related to a protein-protein network of 12 muscle component proteins. Muscle fibre hyperplasia was also accompanied by decreased abundance in the fatty acid degradation and calcium signalling pathways. In addition, metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway decreased in grass carp after ingestion of faba bean, leading to haemolysis. These findings could provide a reference for the prevention and treatment of human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (""favism"")."
0,"In the environment, there are aquatic pollutants that disrupt androgen signaling in fish. Laboratory and field-based experiments have utilized omics technologies to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying androgen-receptor agonism/antagonism. Transcriptomics and proteomics studies with 17β-trenbolone, a growth-promoting pharmaceutical found in water systems surrounding cattle feed lots, and androgens such as 17α-methyltestosterone and 17α-methyldihydrotestosterone, have been conducted in ovary and liver of fish that include the fathead minnow (FHM) (Pimephales promelas), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Qurt medaka (Oryzias latipes), and zebrafish (Danio rerio). In this mini-review, we survey recent omics studies in fish and reveal that, despite the diversity of species and tissues examined, there are common cellular responses that are observed with waterborne androgenic treatments. Recurring themes in gene ontology include apoptosis, transport and oxidation of lipids, synthesis and transport of hormones, immune response, protein metabolism, and cell proliferation. However, we also discuss other mechanisms other than androgen receptor (AR) activation, such as responses to toxicant stress, estrogen receptor agonism, aromatization of androgens into estrogens, and inhibitory feedback mechanisms by high levels of androgens that may also explain molecular responses in fish. To further explore androgen-responsive protein networks, a sub-network enrichment analysis was performed on protein data collected from the livers of female FHMs exposed to 17β-trenbolone. We construct a putative AR-regulated protein/cell process network in the liver that includes B-lymphocyte differentiation, xenobiotic clearance, low-density lipoprotein oxidation, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and permeability of blood vessels. We demonstrate that construction of protein networks can offer insight into cell processes that are potentially regulated by androgens."
0,"Fish oil, containing mainly long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA), has been found to acutely stimulate protein synthesis and insulin-mediated glucose metabolism. However, the underlying mechanism and more prolonged effect of fish oil during ageing remain to be determined."
1,"Fish oil (EPAX6000; 49.6 % eicosapentaenoic acid, 50.4 % docosahexaenoic acid) or control oil (60 % olive, 40 % soy) supplementation was delivered, via chocolate-derived sweets, to rats for 8 weeks. Throughout the study, food intake and body weight were recorded and body composition was investigated using EchoMRI. During the last 40 min of a 6 h infusion, with labelled dextrose ([U-(13)C]glucose) and amino acids ([1-(13)C]phenylalanine), blood samples were collected to assess glucose and phenylalanine kinetics. Soleus and longissimus dorsi muscles were extracted for protein and mRNA analyses."
2,"Fish oil had no effect on food intake or body composition. An increased whole-body glucose turnover, mainly accounted for via an increase in endogenous glucose production, was observed with fish oil feeding. No effects on whole-body phenylalanine turnover were observed. In longissimus dorsi, fish oil augmented the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)([Tyr458]) (P = 0.04) and 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70s6k)([Thr389]) (P = 0.04). There were no differences in protein kinase B (Akt)([Ser473]), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)([Ser2448]), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) 56 kDa regulatory B subunit γ (PP2A-B56-γ), forkhead box containing proteins O-subclass 3a (FOX03a)([Ser253]) or inflammatory markers (Interleukin-6, Interleukin-1 β, tumour necrosis factor-α, and cyclooxygenase-2)."
3,Our data suggest that the fish oil may stimulate endogenous glucose production and increase anabolic signalling in ageing rats.
0,"Fish are an important source of dietary protein for humans throughout the world. However, they are recognized as one of the most common food allergens and pose a serious health problem in countries where fish consumption is high. Many marine fish allergens have been extensively studied, but relatively little is known about freshwater fish allergens. This study identified two main allergens from blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala), a freshwater fish widely consumed in China. Sera from 11 patients with convincing clinical history of blunt snout bream allergy were utilized in IgE immunoblot analysis to identify prominent allergens. Several blunt snout bream proteins revealed specific binding to serum IgE, with the 47 and 41 kDa proteins being the most immunodominant among them. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D SDS-PAGE) enabled resolution of the 47 and 41 kDa proteins into several protein spots with distinct isoelectric points. 2D SDS-PAGE along with IgE immunoblot analysis further confirmed the strong reactivity of these protein spots with the pooled sera from blunt snout bream-sensitive patients. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis of the peptides generated by trypsin digestion of the different spots corresponding to the 47 and 41 kDa proteins indicated that these spots were isoforms of enolase and muscle creatine kinase, respectively. The potential allergenicity of these proteins was further verified by an bioinformatics approach using the full-length and 80 amino acid sliding window FASTA searches, which revealed a significant amino acid sequence homology between blunt snout bream allergens and several known inhaled and crustacean allergens."
0,"This study aims to assess effects of 96 h goldfish exposure to 1, 10 and 100 mg/L of the herbicide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), on metabolic indices and free radical process markers in white muscle of a commercial fish, the goldfish Carassius auratus L. Most oxidative stress markers and antioxidant enzymes were not affected at 2,4-D fish treatment. 2,4-D fish exposure induced the elevated levels of total (by 46% and 40%) and reduced (by 77% and 73%) glutathione in muscles of goldfish of 10 mg/L 2,4-D and recovery (after 100 mg/L of 2,4-D exposure) groups, respectively. However, in muscles of 100 mg/L 2,4-D exposed goldfish these parameters were depleted (by 47% and 64%). None of investigated parameters of protein and carbohydrate metabolisms changed in white muscles of 2,4-D exposed fish, with exception of lactate dehydrogenase activity, which was slightly (by 11-15%) elevated in muscles of goldfish exposed to 10-100 mg/L of 2,4-D, but also recovered. Thus, the short term exposure of goldfish to the selected concentrations of 2,4-D does not substantially affect their white muscle, suggesting the absence of any effect under the environmentally relevant concentrations."
0,"This study examined the effects on conformation and oxidation of myofibrillar protein in largemouth bass by different thawing methods. The conventional thawing, microwave thawing, microwave (MVT) or ultrasound combined with vacuum thawing, microwave or far-infrared thawing (FMT) combined with magnetic nanoparticles were used in this experiment. The physicochemical changes were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic rheology. The protein structure changes were measured by Raman, intrinsic fluorescence, and second-derivative ultraviolet spectrometry. The degree of protein aggregation was evaluated by surface hydrophobicity, particle size, and zeta-potential measurements. Total sulfhydryl content, protein carbonyl content, Ca<sup>2+</sup> -ATPase activity, and SDS-PAGE were used to analyze the degree of protein oxidation. Results showed that MVT and FMT samples had better thermal stability, more stable protein conformation, and a lower degree of protein oxidation. Thus, these two methods would be beneficial to sustain the quality of thawed fillets. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In the market circulation, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) need to be frozen. The thawing methods can directly affect the quality of frozen fish, thus causing the changes in the conformation of the myofibrillar protein in fish, and also affecting the degree of protein oxidation. The results showed that the microwave combined with vacuum and the magnetic nanoparticles combined with far-infrared thawing had less effect on myofibrillar protein of fish and were a better thawing method."
0,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in regulating gene expression, and myostatin (MSTN) has been widely recognized as a key gene for muscle growth and development. Through high-throughput sequencing to study the effects of starvation on miRNA transcriptomes in Larimichthys crocea muscle tissue, we found that the expression of miR-2014, miR-1231 and miR-1470 were significantly different between fasting and normal feeding Larimichthys crocea. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR-2014, miR-1231 and miR-1470 target MSTN mRNA 3'UTR. To verify the accuracy of predictions, we constructed double luciferase plasmids containing MSTN 3'UTR and confirmed that miR-2014-5p and miR-1231-5p can inhibit MSTN expression by targeting MSTN 3'UTR using double luciferase experiments, while miR-1470 is not involved in regulation. Subsequent site-directed mutation experiments reflected the specificity of the target sequence. In addition, quantitative PCR experiments revealed that miR-2014-5p and miR-1231-5p may participate in the regulation of MSTN expression in fasting and refeeding period, respectively. These results implied that miRNA may take part in muscle growth regulation during starvation. It provides some insights into the molecular regulation mechanism of MSTN in response to starvation stress in fish."
0,"Using classic haem protein quantification methods, the extraction step in buffer or acid acetone often becomes limiting if muscle is oxidised and/or stored; haem-proteins then tend to bind to muscle components like myofibrils and/or biomembranes. The objective of this study was to develop a new haem protein determination method for fish muscle overcoming such extractability problems. The principle was to homogenise and heat samples in an SDS-containing phosphate buffer to dissolve major muscle components and convert ferrous/ferric haem proteins to hemichromes with a unique absorption peak at 535 nm. Hb-recovery tests with the new and classic methods showed that the new method and Hornsey's method performed significantly better on fresh Hb-enriched cod mince than Brown's and Drabkin's methods; recovery was ⩾98%. However, in highly oxidised samples and in cod protein isolates made with acid pH-shift processing, the new method performed better than Hornsey's method (63% and 87% vs. 50% and 68% recovery). Further, the new method performed well in fish muscle with ⩽30% lipid, <5% NaCl and pH 5.5-7.0; it was also unaffected by freezing/frozen storage."
0,"Smyd1 is a SET and MYND domain-containing protein, which functions as a histone methyltransferase for control of gene expression and regulates the skeletal and cardiac muscle differentiation. In this study, the full-length cDNA sequences of Smyd1a and Smyd1b were cloned from Chinese perch, and their molecular structure and expression profile in response to nutrition supply and in vivo IGF treatments were also analyzed. The cDNA sequence of Smyd1a and Smyd1b consists of 1862 and 1802 base pairs (bp), encoding 479 and 476 amino acids, respectively. The SET domains of the two proteins were split into two segments by the MYND domain. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of Smyd1a contains an extra 13-aa insertion in the SET domain in comparison with Smyd1b. The two genes apparently exhibited temporal and spatial differential expression status. In adults, the two genes showed the higher expression level in the muscle and heart than in other testing tissues. During the post-embryonic developmental stages, the higher expression of Smyd1a was detected at 150 days post-hatching (dph), whereas the expression of Smyd1b peaked at 50 dph. It was indicated that they have potential function in muscle developmental regulation. The mRNA levels of Smyd1a and Smyd1b were sharply up-regulated within one day after refeeding in the Chinese perch juveniles following fasting for a week. Moreover, IGF-1 treatments in vivo significantly stimulated their expression in the skeletal muscle. Together, these data provide us with further understanding of the molecular characterization and expression regulation of the two genes upon internal and external stimuli."
0,"Circadian clock genes and myogenic factors are tightly integrated to influence muscle growth upon dietary deprivation in animals. In this study, we reported that upon short-term fasting of Nile tilapia juveniles for 7 and 15 days, the growth of the fish stagnated and the size of muscle fibers decreased. To reveal the molecular mechanisms of how starvation affects fish muscle growth, we analyzed the rhythmic expression of circadian clock genes and myogenic factors. After 7 and 15 days of fasting treatment, the muscle tissues were collected for 24 h (at zeitgeber times ZT0, ZT3, ZT6, ZT9, ZT12, ZT18, ZT21, and ZT24) from tilapia juveniles. Among the 27 clock genes, the expression of cyr1b, nr1d1, per1, clocka, clockb, ciarta, and aanat2 displayed a daily rhythmicity in normal daily cycle, while arntl2, cry1a, cry1b, npas2, nr1d2b, per2, per3, rorαb, clocka, clockb, nfil3, cipca, and cipcb exhibited daily rhythmicity in the fasting fish muscles. The transcript levels of clockb showed moderate positive correlation with the aanat2, ciarta, cry1b, and nr1d1 in the muscle tissue of normally fed Nile tilapia juvenile. In comparison of the two treatment modes, the expression levels of clocka, clockb, and cry1b showed the rhythmicity, but clockb expression was significantly decreased and the acrophase had shifted. The transcript levels of fbxo32 and pdk4 had either moderate or strong positive correlations with other daily expression of clock genes except arntl2 in the muscle after 7-day fasting. The expressions of myogenic regulatory factors were also either upregulated or downregulated. These observations demonstrated that dietary starvation might affect fish muscle growth by modulating the differential expression of circadian clock genes and myogenic factors. Thus, our work provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of dietary starvation on fish growth and may provide dietary administration in aquiculture."
0,"Protocols that improve growth performance in fish while assuring product quality are important for aquaculture. Fasting followed by refeeding may promote compensatory growth, thus optimizing growth performance. During fasting and refeeding, fast-twitch muscle, which comprises most of fish fillet, undergoes intense plasticity. In this work, we studied the proteome of pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) fast-twitch muscle after 30 days of fasting (D30), 30 days of refeeding (D60) and 60 days of refeeding (D90) with two-dimensional electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Body mass, growth rate and muscle histology were also assessed. At D30, fish presented muscle catabolism and decreased growth. Proteomic analysis showed that metabolism proteins were the most affected, up and downregulated. Cytoskeleton and amino acid biosynthesis proteins were downregulated, while nuclear and regulatory proteins were upregulated. At D60, fish showed accelerated growth, despite the body mass not completely recovering. Metabolism proteins were still the most affected. Amino acid biosynthesis proteins became upregulated, while cytoskeleton proteins remained downregulated. At D90, the fish presented total compensatory growth. Many metabolic proteins were up or downregulated. Few cytoskeleton proteins remained differentially expressed. Amino acid biosynthesis proteins were mostly upregulated, but less than at D60. Prolonged fasting followed by refeeding also led to the regulation of possible meat quality biomarkers, such as antioxidant enzymes. This fact suggests possible consequences of this protocol on fish meat quality. Our work also enriches our knowledge on proteomic changes during muscle plasticity that occur during fasting and refeeding diet protocols."
0,"Fish oil (FO) supplementation potentiates muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in response to a hyperaminoacidemic-hyperinsulinemic infusion. Whether FO supplementation potentiates MPS in response to protein ingestion or when protein ingestion is combined with resistance exercise (RE) remains unknown. In a randomized, parallel group design, 20 healthy males were randomized to receive 5 g/day of either FO or coconut oil control (CO) for 8 weeks. After supplementation, participants performed a bout of unilateral RE followed by ingestion of 30 g of whey protein. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained before and after supplementation for assessment of muscle lipid composition and relevant protein kinase activities. Infusion of L-[ring-(13)C6] phenylalanine was used to measure basal myofibrillar MP Sat rest (REST), in a nonexercised leg following protein ingestion (FED) and following RE and protein ingestion (FEDEX).MPS was significantly elevated above REST during FEDEX in both the FO and CO groups, but there was no effect of supplementation. There was a significant increase in MPS in both groups above REST during FED but no effect of supplementation. Supplementation significantly decreased pan PKB activity at RESTin the FO group but not the CO group. There was a significant increase from REST at post-RE for PKB and AMPKα2 activity in the CO group but not in the FO group. In FEDEX, there was a significant increase in p70S6K1 activity from REST at 3 h in the CO group only. These data highlight that 8 weeks of FO supplementation alters kinase signaling activity in response to RE plus protein ingestion without influencing MPS."
0,"In the current study, the preparation conditions of neutrase hydrolysate (SMH) from skate (Raja porosa) muscle protein were optimized using orthogonal L9(3)4 tests, and R values indicated that pH was the most important factor affecting HO· scavenging activity of SMH. Under the optimum conditions of pH 7.0, enzymolysis temperature 60 °C, enzyme/substrate ratio (E/S) 2%, and enzymolysis time 5 h, EC50 of SMH on HO· was 2.14 ± 0.17 mg/mL. Using ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography, and RP-HPLC, two novel antioxidant nonapeptides (SP-A and SP-B) were isolated from SMH and their amino acid sequences were found to be APPTAYAQS (SP-A) and NWDMEKIWD (SP-B) with calculated molecular masses of 904.98 Da and 1236.38 Da, respectively. Both showed strong antioxidant activities. SP-A and SP-B exhibited good scavenging activities on HO· (EC50 0.390 and 0.176 mg/mL), DPPH· (EC50 0.614 and 0.289 mg/mL), and O2-· (EC50 0.215 and 0.132 mg/mL) in a dose-dependent manner. SP-B was also effective against lipid peroxidation in the model system. The aromatic (2Trp), acidic (2Asp and Glu), and basic (Lys) amino acid residues within the sequences of SP-B might account for its pronounced antioxidant activity. The results of this study suggested that protein hydrolysate and peptides from skate muscle might be effective as food additives for retarding lipid peroxidation occurring in foodstuffs. "
0,"Some vertebrate muscles (e.g. those in bony fish) have a simple lattice A-band which is so well ordered that low-angle X-ray diffraction patterns are sampled in a simple way amenable to crystallographic techniques. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction through the contractile cycle should provide a movie of the molecular movements involved in muscle contraction. Generation of 'Muscle-The Movie' was suggested in the 1990s and since then efforts have been made to work out how to achieve it. Here we discuss how a movie can be generated, we discuss the problems and opportunities, and present some new observations. Low angle X-ray diffraction patterns from bony fish muscles show myosin layer lines that are well sampled on row-lines expected from the simple hexagonal A-band lattice. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd myosin layer lines at d-spacings of around 42.9 nm, 21.5 nm and 14.3 nm respectively, get weaker in patterns from active muscle, but there is a well-sampled intensity remnant along the layer lines. We show here that the pattern from the tetanus plateau is not a residual resting pattern from fibres that have not been fully activated, but is a different well-sampled pattern showing the presence of a second, myosin-centred, arrangement of crossbridges within the active crossbridge population. We also show that the meridional M3 peak from active muscle has two components of different radial widths consistent with (i) active myosin-centred (probably weak-binding) heads giving a narrow peak and (ii) heads on actin in strong states giving a broad peak."
0,"Vertebrates are characterized by possession of hypobranchial muscles (HBMs). Cyclostomes, or modern jawless vertebrates, possess a rudimentary and superficial HBM lateral to the pharynx, whereas the HBM in jawed vertebrates is internalized and anteroposteriorly specified. Precursor cells of the HBM, marked by expression of Lbx1, originate from somites and undergo extensive migration before becoming innervated by the hypoglossal nerve. How the complex form of HBM arose in evolution is relevant to the establishment of the vertebrate body plan, but despite having long been assumed to be similar to that of limb muscles, modification of developmental mechanisms of HBM remains enigmatic."
1,"Here we characterize the expression of Lbx genes in lamprey and hagfish (cyclostomes) and catshark (gnathostome; jawed vertebrates). We show that the expression patterns of the single cyclostome Lbx homologue, Lbx-A, do not resemble the somitic expression of mammalian Lbx1. Disruption of Lbx-A revealed that LjLbx-A is required for the formation of both HBM and body wall muscles, likely due to the insufficient extension of precursor cells rather than to hindered muscle differentiation. Both homologues of Lbx in the catshark were expressed in the somitic muscle primordia, unlike in amniotes. During catshark embryogenesis, Lbx2 is expressed in the caudal HBM as well as in the abdominal rectus muscle, similar to lamprey Lbx-A, whereas Lbx1 marks the rostral HBM and pectoral fin muscle."
2,"We conclude that the vertebrate HBM primarily emerged as a specialized somatic muscle to cover the pharynx, and the anterior internalized HBM of the gnathostomes is likely a novelty added rostral to the cyclostome-like HBM, for which duplication and functionalization of Lbx genes would have been a prerequisite."
0,"African lungfishes can aestivate and remain torpid without food and water for years, but disuse muscle atrophy is not prominent during aestivation. This study aimed to clone myostatin (mstn/Mstn), a factor associated with disuse muscle atrophy in mammals, from the skeletal muscle of the African lungfish Protopterus annectens, and to determine its mRNA expression level and protein abundance therein during the induction, maintenance, and arousal phases of aestivation. The complete coding cDNA sequence of mstn comprised 1128 bp, encoding for 376 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 42.9 kDa. It was grouped together with Mstn/MSTN of coelacanth and tetrapods in a clade separated from teleost Mstn. After 6 days (the induction phase) of aestivation, the mstn transcript level in the muscle increased significantly, while the protein abundance of Mstn remained comparable to the control. Following that, a significant increase in the expression levels of mstn/Mstn occurred on day 12 (the early maintenance phase) of aestivation. After 6 months of aestivation (the prolonged maintenance phase), the expression levels of mstn/Mstn returned to control levels, indicating the possible impediment of a drastic increase in muscle degradation to prevent muscle atrophy. During 1-3 days of arousal from aestivation, the expression levels of mstn/Mstn in the muscle remained comparable to the control. Hence, tissue reconstruction/regeneration of certain organs might not involve the mobilization of amino acids from the muscle during the early arousal. These results provide insights into how aestivating P. annectens regulates the expression of mstn/Mstn possibly to ameliorate disuse muscle atrophy."
0,"The effects of several phenolic ocmpounds (caffeic acid, catechin, ferullic acid and tannic acid) at various concentrations (1, 3 and 5% based on protein) on cross-linking and properties of film from myofibrillar proteins of bigeye snapper (Priacanthus tayenus) were investigated. Among all phenolic compounds used, tannic acid exhibited the highest cross-linking ability on myofibrillar protein as evidenced by higher decrease in free amino groups with coincidentally lower band intensity of myosin heavy chain (MHC). In addition, the extent of protein cross-linking increased with increasing concentration of phenolic compounds. Addition of phenolic compounds could enhance mechanical properties of the resulting films. As phenolic compounds content increased, Young's modulus (E) and tensile strength (TS) of the films increased, while their elongation at break (EAB) decreased (P<0.05), suggesting stronger and stiffer film structure. At the same concentration used, tannic acid rendered the film with higher mechanical properties, compared to others. Phenolic compounds decreased film transparency and affected color of the films differently, depending on types and concentrations used. Films from myofibrillar proteins with and without polyphenol generally had the excellent barrier properties to UV light at the wavelength of 200-800 nm. Therefore, it could potentially be used as inner packaging material for high-fat foods to prevent the lipid oxidation and thus prolonging the shelf-life of foods during storage."

Phlorotannin can be easily induced to form quinone compounds in an oxidizing environment, while o-quinone has been proven to be a reactive, electrophilic intermediate that easily reacts with proteins to form rigid molecular crosslinking networks. The objective of this study was to investigate the synergistic effects of ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation (1 h, 15 W m<sup>-2</sup> ) and various concentrations of Laminaria japonica phlorotannin extracts (PTE) on the gel properties of grass carp myofibrillar protein (MP)."
1,"UVA treatment and PTE could synergistically improve the MP gel properties more than PTE alone (P < 0.05). At 625 mmol kg<sup>-1</sup> MP PTE alone, the gel strength and cooking yield reached 3.10 ± 0.16 g cm and 47.45 ± 0.35%, respectively, while with the same level of PTE plus UVA they became 4.26 ± 0.19 g cm and 53.89 ± 1.54%, respectively. The three-dimensional network structure of the gel (with PTE + UVA) showed higher connectivity and tightness than that of the control group (no treatment)."

Despite the discovery of several toxins such as gymnocins and gymnodimines in <i>K. mikimotoi</i>, the mechanisms underlying the ichthyotoxicity of this species remain unclear, and molecular studies on this topic have never been reported. The present study investigates the fish-killing mechanisms of <i>K. mikimotoi</i> through comparative proteomic analysis. Marine medaka, a model fish organism, was exposed to <i>K. mikimotoi</i> for a three-part time period (LT<sub>25</sub>, LT<sub>50</sub> and LT<sub>90</sub>). Proteins extracted from the whole fish were separated by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and differentially expressed proteins were identified with reference to an untreated control. The change in fish proteomes over the time-course of exposure were analyzed. A total of 35 differential protein spots covering 19 different proteins were identified, of which most began to show significant change in expression levels at the earliest stage of intoxication. Among the 19 identified proteins, some are closely related to the oxidative stress responses, energy metabolism, and muscle contraction. We propose that oxidative stress-mediated muscle damage might explain the symptoms developed during the ichthyotoxicity test, such as gasping for breath, loss of balance, and body twitching. Our findings lay the foundations for more in-depth studies of the mechanisms of <i>K. mikimotoi</i>'s ichthyotoxicity."
0,"The low methionine content in plant-based diets is a major limiting factor for feed utilization by animals. However, the molecular consequences triggered by methionine deficiency have not been well characterized, especially in fish species, whose metabolism is unique in many aspects and important for aquaculture industry. In the present study, the primary muscle cells of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.) were isolated and treated with or without methionine for 12 h in culture. The responses of nutrient sensing pathways, the proteomic profiling of metabolic processes, and the expressions of key metabolic molecules were systematically examined. Methionine deprivation (MD) suppressed target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling, activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and amino acid response (AAR) pathways. Reduced cellular protein synthesis and increased protein degradation by MD led to increased intracellular free amino acid levels and degradations. MD also reduced glycolysis and lipogenesis while stimulated lipolysis, thus resulted in decreased intracellular lipid pool. MD significantly enhanced energy expenditure through stimulated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Collectively, our results identified a comprehensive set of transcriptional, proteomic, and signaling responses generated by MD and provided the molecular insight into the integration of cell homeostasis and metabolic controls in fish species."
0,"This study was conducted to characterise the muscle-specific gene expression, energy metabolism level and growth rates of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. reared under different photoperiod regimes. The effects of two photoperiod regimes - LD 16:8 (16 h light:8 h dark) and LD 24:0 (24 h light:0 h dark) over a period of 3 months (August to October) on growth, energy metabolism enzyme activities (cytochrome c oxidase, COX; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; and aldolase) and the gene expression levels of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs - MyoD1 paralogues (MyoD1a, MyoD1b, MyoD1c), Myf5, MyoG), myostatin paralogues (MSTN-1a, MSTN-1b, MSTN-2a) and the fast skeletal myosin heavy chain (MyHC) in the muscles of Atlantic salmon underyearling fry (0+) were investigated. The experiment was conducted in a fish hatchery with natural variations in water temperature. The results were compared with those obtained in salmon reared under the lighting conditions of a fish hatchery (HL, hatchery lighting). The results revealed that the fry reared under constant light (LD 24:0) grew faster and were bigger at the end of the experiment. Fishes reared within the photoperiod regime LD 16:8 had a lower growth rate. COX activity was lower in fish under the LD 16:8 regime compared with the LD 24:0 group. The LDH and aldolase enzyme activities were higher in the group with constant light in comparison to control in the beginning of September. The expression level for all of the genes studied variated during the duration of the experiment, and MyHC, MyoG, MyoD1a and Myf5 expression depended on the light regime as well. The more noticeable changes in gene expression occurred in October. The MyHC and MyoG mRNA levels increased, accompanied by MyD1c gene expression, in both groups that had additional lighting (LD 16:8 and LD24:0) at the beginning of October and were higher than the HL group. In the HL group, the elevation of MyHC and MyoG mRNA was gradual during October, but there was a sharp increase in Myf5 expression at the beginning of October. MyoD1 paralogues differently expressed during the experiment. The MyoD1a mRNA level was elevated at the end of October along with MyHC and MyoG expression, but MyoD1b and MyoD1c mRNA levels decreased along with Myf5 gene expression. The expression of MSTN paralogues were elevated with increases in MyHC and MRFs transcripts. These findings show that constant light has a positive effect on the growth rate of salmon, affecting the aerobic and anaerobic capacity in their muscles. The alterations in muscle-specific gene expression between the groups with different light indicated that the mechanisms for regulating muscle growth processes in fish depend on photoperiod duration."
0,"Current study aims to determine difference in metal accumulation pattern in muscle of Liza parsia (pelagic, omnivore), Amblypharyngodon mola (surface feeder, herbivore) and Mystus gulio (benthic, carnivore) depending on their niche and feeding habit and how it affects the endogenous antioxidants and glucose metabolism in fish muscle. Fishes were collected from Malancha, Diamond Harbour and Chandanpiri, West Bengal, India. Concentrations of lead, zinc, cadmium, chromium were measured in water, sediment and fish muscle. Metal pollution index (MPI) and bioconcentration factor (BCF) was calculated to evaluate the ability of fish to accumulate specific metals in muscle tissue from the aquatic environment. Metal concentrations were found signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.05) in water, sediment, ﬁsh muscles from Malancha than Chandanpiri and Diamond Harbour. L. parsia (MPI: 0.4-1.6) showed highest metal deposition in their muscle followed by A. mola (MPI: 0.37-1.38) and M. gulio (MPI: 0.2-1.2). Malondealdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S transferase, glutathione reductase and cortisol levels increased in case of L. parsia from Malancha and Chandanpiri. Succinate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, Ca<sup>+2</sup> ATPase and cytochrome C oxidase levels were significantly (P < 0.05) lower at Malancha and Chandanpiri than Diamond Harbour. Heat shock protein (HSP70) expression was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in all fish species at Malancha followed by Chandanpiri and Diamond Harbour. Glucose, glycogen, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and glycogen phosphorylase levels varied between sites and selected fish species. Serum cortisol level was measured and found to be the highest in L. parsia from Malancha (2.94 ± 0.12 ng/ml) and the lowest in M. gulio from Diamond Harbour (0.7 ± 0.05 ng/ml). The results indicate that metal toxicity alters antioxidant levels, oxidative status and energy production in fish in species specific manner. Our results also indicate that Mystus has the highest degree of adaptability in response to metal toxicity possibly due to its specific food habit and niche position. Therefore, it can be concluded that maintenance of oxidative and metabolic status to combat metal-induced oxidative load will be helpful for the fishes to acquire better resistance under such eco-physiological stress. Alteration of niche and interactive segregation in aquatic organism may be one of the key modulator of resistance against such stress."
0,"Stanniocalcin (STC), first isolated from the corpuscles of Stannius (CS) of teleost fishes and a systemic regulator of mineral metabolism, is present in all vertebrates as two isoforms, STC1 and STC2, encoded by separate genes. Here we show that the genome of Tetraodon nigroviridis, and other teleosts, possess duplicate genes for each STC isoform, designated stc1-a and -b, and stc2-a and -b. Stc1-a was cloned from CS, stc2-a from muscle and the two novel cDNAs, stc1-b and stc2-b, from brain. However, stc2-b was isolated as a conjoined (read-through) transcript with bod1 (bi-orientation defective 1, or FAM44B), and two additional alternative conjoined transcripts were also isolated. The predicted STC products shared the typical vertebrate 10 conserved cysteine residues and N-linked glycosylation motifs, in addition to specific features. Gene structure was generally conserved with four exons and three introns with the exception of stc1-a which gained an extra intron in exon three, originating one extra exon. Gene order and synteny is also maintained across vertebrates and the cpeb4 gene identified in the homologue region of the chordate Ciona was linked to vertebrate stc2 but not stc1. Immunohistochemistry in different species revealed that STC1-A was found only in CS and in a few cells in kidney. STC1-B had a restricted expression and was more prominent in the gills. STC2-A was detected in a variety of tissues, including pituitary, with most abundant immunoreaction in kidney cells and gill rakers and the CS was negative. Expression of stc1-a in CS of Tetraodon was 15-fold (p<0.05) up-regulated 2 h after transfer from 2.9 mM Ca(2+) to 10 mM Ca(2+) water and down-regulated after 12 hours to 11-fold lower than 2.9 mM Ca(2+) fish (p<0.05). With the exception of stc1-a in CS, low expression levels and high individual variation were generally found for the expression of stc transcripts in kidney and gills, with no statistically significant changes in response to the hypercalcemic shock. In conclusion, both stc1 and stc2 genes are represented by paralogues in teleosts genomes and the analysis performed suggests that only stc1-a in the CS is involved in extracellular calcium regulation. The widespread distribution of stcs in fish tissues supports pleiotropic roles."
0,"Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) is a key negative regulator of TLR-mediated innate immune responses. The structure and function of Tollip have been well identified in mammals, but the information about Tollip is still limited in teleost fishes. In the present study, the homologue of Tollip was cloned from Japanese eel. It contained an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 276 amino acids which shared high identities with other homologues from different species. Multiple alignment of the amino acid sequence showed that the AjTollip protein has the typical conserved domains including an N-terminal Target of Myb1 (Tom1) binding domain (TBD), a central conserved 2 (C2) domain, and a C-terminal coupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation (CUE) domain. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed a broad expression for AjTollip in a wide range of tissues, with the highest expression in the liver, a relatively high expression in the spleen, kidney, gills, skin and intestine, and a low expression in the heart and muscle. The AjTollip expressions in the liver and kidney were significantly induced following injection with the bacterial mimic LPS, the viral mimic poly I:C, and Aeromonas hydrophila infection. In vitro, the AjTollip transcripts of Japanese eel liver cells were significantly enhanced by the treatment of LPS, poly I:C, CpG-DNA, and PGN or the stimulation of high concentration of Aeromonas hydrophila (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/mL and 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> cfu/mL). Subcellular localization study showed that AjTollip was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm in a condensed state. When AjTollip was co-transfected with AjMyD88 into HEK293 cells, the luciferase activities of NF-κB were significantly decreased compared with that of AjMyD88 single-transfection groups in natural state or under the stimulation of LPS and poly I:C. These results collectively suggested that AjTollip functions as a negative regulator of MyD88-dependent TLR signaling and plays an important role in fish defense against viral and bacterial infections."
0,"Effects of the dietary therapeutic dose of oxytetracycline (OTC) at 80 mg/kg biomass/day for consecutive 10 days on the behaviour, feed intake, mortality, residue accumulation and depletion, antioxidant capacity and immune-related genes expression in juvenile Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus were evaluated. OTC-dosing caused mortalities, reduced feed intake, and biomass reduction at 24.5-28.5 °C. OTC residues recorded on day 10 (161.40 ± 11.10 ng/g) were within the maximum residue limits of the Codex Alimentarius. The withdrawal period was 7 days as per the European Commission's regulation. Traces of residues were present even on day 42 post-OTC-dosing. Dietary OTC reduced the antioxidant capacity of the liver and muscle tissues and down-regulated the expression of tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and heat shock protein-70 genes in the liver significantly during the dosing period. The data generated on the biosafety of OTC-dosing may offer inputs for the development of management strategies in maintaining fish health and food safety."
0,"Myostatin (MSTN) lacking could lead to enhanced muscle growth and lipid metabolism disorder in animals. Plenty of researches have been performed to warrant a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the enhanced muscle growth; however, mechanisms for lipid metabolic changes are poorly understood. In this study, MSTN-depletion loaches Misgurnus anguillicaudatus (MU for short) were firstly generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technique. Based on histological observation, we found that skeletal muscle fat accumulation in MU sharply reduced compared with wild-type loaches (WT for short). To further investigate the fat change, muscle lipidomic analysis was performed. There were no significant differences in three membrane phospholipid contents between WT and MU. The contents of six other major lipid species in MU muscles were all significantly lower than those in WT muscles, indicating that MSTN deficiency could obviously decrease muscle lipid production in the loach. Meanwhile, it was also supported by results of three lipogenesis-related genes' expressions. And then combined with muscle ATP determination and gene expression profiles of the five mitochondrial respiration chain complexes, we speculated that MSTN lacking may cause the weak of mitochondrial respiration functions in the loach muscles, leading to ATP synthesis decreasing and finally reducing the production of lipids."
0,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is well known to be induced by exercise and to mediate important metabolic changes in the skeletal muscle of mammals. Despite the physiological importance of exercise as a modulator of energy use by locomotory muscle, the regulation of this enzyme by swimming has not been investigated in fish. We found that sustained swimming (40 days at 0.75 body lengths s(-1)) increased AMPK activity in red and white trout skeletal muscle (3.9- and 2.2-fold, respectively) as well as the expression of AMPK target genes involved in energy use: lipoprotein lipase and citrate synthase in red and white muscle and CPT1β1b and PGC-1α in red muscle. Furthermore, electrical pulse stimulation of cultured trout myotubes increased AMPK activity and glucose uptake (1.9- and 1.2-fold, respectively) in an AMPK-dependent manner. These results suggest that AMPK may play an important mediatory role in the metabolic adaptation to swimming in fish skeletal muscle. "
0,"Myostatin (MSTN) is a member of the transforming growth factor-ß superfamily, known as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle development and growth in mammals. In contrast to mammals, fish possess at least two paralogs of MSTN: MSTN-1 and MSTN-2. Here we describe the cloning and sequence analysis of spliced and precursor (unspliced) transcripts as well as the 5' flanking region of MSTN-2 from the marine fish Umbrina cirrosa (ucMSTN-2). In silico analysis revealed numerous putative cis regulatory elements including several E-boxes known as binding sites to myogenic transcription factors. Transient transfection experiments using non-muscle and muscle cell lines showed high transcriptional activity in muscle cells and in differentiated neural cells, in accordance with our previous findings in MSTN-2 promoter from Sparus aurata. Comparative informatics analysis of MSTN-2 from several fish species revealed high conservation of the predicted amino acid sequence as well as the gene structure (exon length) although intron length varied between species. The proximal promoter of MSTN-2 gene was found to be conserved among Perciforms. In conclusion, this study reinforces our conclusion that MSTN-2 promoter is a very strong promoter, especially in muscle cells. In addition, we show that the MSTN-2 gene structure is highly conserved among fishes as is the predicted amino acid sequence of the peptide."
0,"The discovery that cysteine (Cys) S-nitrosation of trout myoglobin (Mb) increases heme O2 affinity has revealed a novel allosteric effect that may promote hypoxia-induced nitric oxide (NO) delivery in the trout heart and improve myocardial efficiency. To better understand this allosteric effect, we investigated the functional effects and structural origin of S-nitrosation in selected fish Mbs differing by content and position of reactive cysteine (Cys) residues. The Mbs from the Atlantic salmon and the yellowfin tuna, containing two and one reactive Cys, respectively, were S-nitrosated in vitro by reaction with Cys-NO to generate Mb-SNO to a similar yield (∼0.50 SH/heme), suggesting reaction at a specific Cys residue. As found for trout, salmon Mb showed a low O2 affinity (P50 = 2.7 torr) that was increased by S-nitrosation (P50 = 1.7 torr), whereas in tuna Mb, O2 affinity (P50 = 0.9 torr) was independent of S-nitrosation. O2 dissociation rates (koff) of trout and salmon Mbs were not altered when Cys were in the SNO or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) forms, suggesting that S-nitrosation should affect O2 affinity by raising the O2 association rate (kon). Taken together, these results indicate that O2-linked S-nitrosation may occur specifically at Cys107, present in salmon and trout Mb but not in tuna Mb, and that it may relieve protein constraints that limit O2 entry to the heme pocket of the unmodified Mb by a yet unknown mechanism. UV-Vis and resonance Raman spectra of the NEM-derivative of trout Mb (functionally equivalent to Mb-SNO and not photolabile) were identical to those of the unmodified Mb, indicating that S-nitrosation does not affect the extent or nature of heme-ligand stabilization of the fully ligated protein. The importance of S-nitrosation of Mb in vivo is confirmed by the observation that Mb-SNO is present in trout hearts and that its level can be significantly reduced by anoxic conditions. "
0,"The aquatic air-breathing fish, Trichogaster microlepis, can be found in fresh water and estuaries. We further evaluated the changes in two important osmoregulatory enzymes, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA) and vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (VHA), in the gills when fish were subjected to deionized water (DW), fresh water (FW), and salinated brackish water (salinity of 10 g/L). Fish were sampled only 4 days after experimental transfer. The mortality, plasma osmolality, and Na(+) concentration were higher in 10 g/L acclimated fish, while their muscle water content decreased with elevated external salinity. The highest NKA protein abundance was found in the fish gills in 10 g/L, and NKA activity was highest in the DW and 10 g/L acclimated fish. The VHA protein levels were highest in 10 g/L, and VHA activity was highest in the DW treatment. From immunohistochemical results, we found three different cell populations: (1) NKA-immunoreactive (NKA-IR) cells, (2) both NKA-IR and HA-IR cells, and (3) HA-IR cells. NKA-IR cells in the lamellar and interlamellar regions significantly increased in DW and 10 g/L treatments. Only HA-IR cells in the lamellar region were significantly increased in DW. In the interlamellar region, there was no difference in the number of HA-IR cells among the three treated. From these results, T. microlepis exhibited osmoregulatory ability in DW and 10 g/L treatments. The cell types involved in ionic regulation were also examined with immunofluorescence staining; three ionocyte types were found which were similar to the zebrafish model."
0,"The proteolytic enzymes involved in normal protein turnover in fish muscle are also responsible for post-mortem softening of the flesh and are therefore potential determinants of product quality. The main enzyme systems involved are calpains, cathepsins, and the ubiquitin-proteasome (UbP). In this study on Sparus aurata (Sa), the coding sequences of cathepsins (SaCTSB and SaCTSDb) and UbP family members (SaN3 and SaUb) were cloned from fast skeletal muscle, and their expression patterns were examined during ontogeny and in a fasting/re-feeding experiment."
1,"The amino acid sequences identified shared 66-100% overall identity with their orthologues in other vertebrates, with well conserved characteristic functional domains and catalytic residues. SaCTSDb showed phylogenetic, sequence and tissue distribution differences with respect to its paralogue SaCTSDa, previously identified in the ovary. Expression of gilthead sea bream cathepsins (B, L, Da, Db) and UbP members (N3, Ub, MuRF1 and MAFbx) in fast skeletal muscle was determined at three different life-history stages and in response to fasting and re-feeding in juveniles. Most of the proteolytic genes analysed were significantly up-regulated during fasting, and down-regulated with re-feeding and, between the fingerling (15 g) and juvenile/adult stages (~50/500 g), consistent with a decrease in muscle proteolysis in both later contexts. In contrast, SaCTSDa and SaMuRF1 expression was relatively stable with ontogeny and SaUb had higher expression in fingerlings and adults than juveniles."
2,"The data obtained in the present study suggest that cathepsins and UbP genes in gilthead sea bream are co-ordinately regulated during ontogeny to control muscle growth, and indicate that feeding regimes can modulate their expression, providing a potential dietary method of influencing post-mortem fillet tenderisation, and hence, product quality."
0,"Electrotransfer of plasmid DNA into skeletal muscle is a common non-viral delivery system for the study of gene function and for gene therapy. However, the effects of epinecidin-1 (epi) on bacterial growth and immune system modulation following its electrotransfer into the muscle of grouper (Epinephelus coioides), a marine fish species, have not been addressed. In this study, pCMV-gfp-epi plasmid was electroporated into grouper muscle, and its effect on subsequent infection with Vibrio vulnificus was examined. Over-expression of epi efficiently reduced bacterial numbers at 24 and 48 h after infection, and augmented the expression of immune-related genes in muscle and liver, inducing a moderate innate immune response associated with pro-inflammatory infiltration. Furthermore, electroporation of pCMV-gfp-epi plasmid without V. vulnificus infection induced moderate expression of certain immune-related genes, particularly innate immune genes. These data suggest that electroporation-mediated gene transfer of epi into the muscle of grouper may hold potential as an antimicrobial therapy for pathogen infection in marine fish."
0,"In the last decade, there has been an increase in the study of the ecology of deep-sea organisms. One way to understand an organism's ecology is the study of its metabolism. According to literature, deep-sea sharks possess a lower anaerobic enzyme activity than their shallow-water counterparts, but no difference has been observed regarding their aerobic enzyme activities. These studies have suggested deep-sea sharks should be slow and listless swimmers. However, other studies based on video observations have revealed differences in cruise swimming speed between different species. The present study examined muscles of squaliform sharks, including both luminous and non-luminous species. We combined measurements of the relative amounts of red and white muscle with assays of enzymes that are used as markers for aerobic (citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase) and anaerobic (lactate dehydrogenase) metabolism, searching for a relationship with cruising speeds. Non-luminous deep-sea species displayed lower aerobic enzyme activities but similar anaerobic enzyme activities than the benthic shallow-water counterpart (Squalus acanthias). Conversely, luminous Etmopteridae species were found to have similar aerobic enzyme activities to S. acanthias but displayed lower anaerobic enzyme activities. Analyses revealed that red muscle proportion and aerobic enzyme activities were positively related to the cruise swimming speed. In contrast, Dalatias licha, which swims at the slowest cruise swimming speed ever recorded, presented a very low aerobic metabolic phenotype (lower aerobic marker enzymes and less red muscle). Finally, the values obtained for white muscle proportion and anaerobic metabolic phenotype suggested a high burst capacity for D. licha and non-luminous sharks."
0,"Rigor mortis occurs when muscle extension vanishes through the irresistible coupling of actin and myosin by the consumption of adenosine triphosphate as energy. To clarify the cause of the differences in the progression of rigor mortis, seven fish species were used as samples. The superprecipitation reaction and Mg<sup>2+</sup> -ATPase activity of actomyosin in dorsal ordinary muscle were measured, and the slope of the regression line between these two variables was calculated for each fish specimen. The fiber types of the dorsal ordinary muscle in each sample fish were discriminated by the stability of actomyosin ATPase at acid and alkaline preincubations."
1,"Positive correlations were found between Mg<sup>2+</sup> -ATPase activity and the superprecipitation reaction of actomyosin in all 27 fish specimens. The slopes of the regression lines were different not only between fish species but also in fish specimens within the same species. The area ratios of pink muscle fibers and the IIa and/or IIb subtypes of white muscle fibers in the dorsal ordinary muscle were also different between fish species, as well as in specimens within the same fish species. A positive correlation was found between the area ratios of pink muscle fibers in dorsal ordinary muscle and the slopes of the regression line."
2,"It was suggested that the differences in characteristics of rigor-mortis-related actomyosin of fish might have been caused by the differences in the interposition ratio of muscle fiber types, especially of the pink muscle fiber type, in the dorsal ordinary muscle. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."
0,"The purpose of the study was to clone the sequences of myogenic regulatory factors in Acipenser dabryanus and explore the changes in their expression during starvation and refeeding in A. dabryanus muscle. One hundred twenty fish (60.532 ± 0.284 g) were randomly assigned to four groups (fasted for 0, 3, 7 or 14 d and then refed for 14 d). Our predictions showed that the coding sequences of myod1, myf5, myog and myf6 in A. dabryanus encoded 275, 248, 248 and 243 amino acids, respectively, and the expression of the four genes was the highest in muscle. During fasting, the expression of myod1 in muscle was significantly decreased in the 14 d group. The expressions of myf5 and myf6 were increased significantly at first and then decreased with prolonged starvation time. The expression of myog in the 14 d group was significantly decreased compared with other groups (P < 0.05). During refeeding, the highest values of myod1 and myf6 expression were found in the 3 d group (P < 0.05).The expressions of myf5 and myog in 0 d and 3 d group were significantly higher than those in 7 d and 14 d group (P < 0.05). These results indicate that myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) play important roles in muscle growth and development in A. dabryanus. The inhibition of long-term starvation (14 d) on the expression of myogenic regulatory factors is probably one of the reasons why it can not achieve full compensation for growth."
0,"Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and prevention of high blood pressure through diet and lifestyle should be a preferred approach. High intake of fish is associated with lower blood pressure, possibly mediated through the proteins since peptides with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting capacities have been identified in fish skin, backbone, and fillet. The effects of cod meals made from residual materials and fillet on blood pressure were investigated in obese Zucker fa/fa rats which spontaneously develop high blood pressure. Rats were fed diets containing water-soluble (stickwater) or water-insoluble (presscake) fractions of protein-rich meals from cod residual materials (head, gut, backbone with muscle residuals, skin, trimmings) or fillet. Rats were fed diets containing 25% of total protein from cod meal and 75% of protein from casein, or casein as the sole protein source (control group) for four weeks. Results show that a diet containing residual presscake meal with high gut content prevented blood pressure increase, and this cod residual meal also showed the strongest in vitro inhibitions of ACE and renin activities. In conclusion, a diet containing water-insoluble proteins (presscake meal) with high gut content prevented increase in blood pressure in obese Zucker fa/fa rats."
0,"Fish protein is a source of animal protein that is consumed worldwide. Although it has been reported that the intake of Alaska pollack protein (APP) reduces serum triglyceride and body fat accumulation in rats, the mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. In the present study, we fed 5-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats a high-fat diet with APP or casein for 4 weeks. We reconfirmed that the intake of APP decreases serum triglycerides and inhibits visceral body fat accumulation in rats. We found that APP had a higher non-digestive protein content than casein, and the amount of protein in feces was higher in the APP group than in the casein group. However, the amount of total lipids in feces did not differ significantly between the groups. We also found that the gastrocnemius muscle, a fast-twitch muscle, tended to increase in weight, and that the epididymal fat weight correlated negatively with gastrocnemius muscle weight in the APP group. These results imply that the enhancement of basal energy expenditure by fast-twitch muscle hypertrophy, rather than the enhancement of lipid excretion via feces, partly causes APP-induced inhibition of lipid accumulation in rats."
0,"Fish venom cytolysins are multifunctional proteins that in addition to their cytolytic/hemolytic effects display neurotoxic, cardiotoxic and inflammatory activities, being described as ""protein lethal factors"". A pore-forming cytolysin called Sp-CTx (Scorpaena plumieriCytolytic Toxin) has been recently purified from the venom of the scorpionfish Scorpaena plumieri. It is a glycoprotein with dimeric constitution, comprising subunits of approximately 65 kDa. Previous studies have revealed that this toxin has a vasorelaxant activity that appears to involve the L-arginine-nitric oxide synthase pathway; however its cardiovascular effects have not been fully comprehended. The present study examined the cardiovascular effects of Sp-CTx in vivo and in vitro. In anesthetized rats Sp-CTx (70 μg/kg i.v) produced a biphasic response which consisted of an initial systolic and diastolic pressure increase followed by a sustained decrease of these parameters and the heart rate. In isolated rats hearts Sp-CTx (10(-9) to 5 × 10(-6) M) produced concentration-dependent and transient ventricular positive inotropic effect and vasoconstriction response on coronary bed. In papillary muscle, Sp-CTx (10(-7) M) also produced an increase in contractile isometric force, which was attenuated by the catecholamine releasing agent tyramine (100 μM) and the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10 μM). On isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes Sp-CTx (1 nM) increased the L-type Ca(2+) current density. The results show that Sp-CTx induces disorders in the cardiovascular system through increase of sarcolemmal calcium influx, which in turn is partially caused by the release of endogenous noradrenaline.

0,"Because Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) has high economic value and its protein-rich muscle tissue is a food source, an increased understanding of the effects and consequences of environmental, nutritional, biological, and industrial factors on meat quality is necessary. To gain insight into cod muscle tissue protein composition, a large-scale proteomics approach has been used. One-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, nanoflow liquid chromatography peptide separation, and linear trap quadrupole mass spectrometry were used to identify 4804 peptides, which retrieved 9113 cod expressed sequence tags (ESTs), which in turn were mapped to 446 unique proteins. The same data set identified 3924 proteins from the zebrafish protein database, which highlights the complementary value of the two approaches. The generated data sets will act as a foundation for studies related to physiological status assessment of cod under different environmental conditions, screening for diseases, and biomarker identification for assessment of fish quality during industrial processing and preservation."
0,"This study was carried out to investigate the effects of dietary vitamin A (VA) on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, digestion, intestinal immune response, and mRNA expression of intestinal tight junction proteins for juvenile hybrid grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus ♀ × Epinephelus lanceolatus ♂). Six isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated to obtain VA levels (317, 1136, 2038, 4142, 7715, 15204 IU/kg diet, respectively). The triplicate groups of fish (average weight of 9.01 ± 0.27 g) were fed twice daily (8:00 and 16:00) for 7 weeks. Based on the broken-line analysis model of WG and LYZ activity, the dietary VA requirement of hybrid grouper were estimated to be 2688.58 and 4096.36 IU/kg diet. The results showed that VA deficiency or excess could reduce Weight gain, specific growth rate, and protein efficiency ratio, and increase feed conversion ratio and hepatosomatic index (P < 0.05). In addition, VA deficiency could reduce the serum activities of acid phosphatase (ACP), superoxide dismutase, and total antioxidant capacity and increase the malondialdehyde content (P < 0.05). VA deficiency also could reduce intestinal activities of ACP, alkaline phosphatase, lysozyme, complement 3, complement 4 contents, and activities of alpha-amylase, lipase, and trypsin (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, VA deficiency could reduce villus height in proximal intestine (PI) and mid intestine (MI), as well as muscle thickness in PI and distal intestine (DI) (P < 0.05). Moreover, VA deficiency could down-regulated antimicrobial peptides (β-defensin, Hepcidin [not in MI and DI], Epinecidin), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor β1 [not in DI]), tight junction proteins (occluding and claudin3) mRNA levels in the PI, MI and DI, and up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α [not in MI] and interleukin 1β [not in MI]), signaling molecules c-Rel and p65 (P < 0.05). Collectively, VA deficiency could reduce growth performance because of a negative effect on intestinal health by depressing digestive abilities, intestinal morphology, immunity and tight junction function in the intestine."
0,"Extensive application of pesticide in agricultural field affects the enzymatic activity of non-target animals, including fishes. In this study, the impact of sublethal concentration of fenvalerate on marker enzymes of freshwater Zebra fish was evaluated. Pesticide-induced stress can specifically affect non target fishes, through elevated level of reactive oxygen species which is responsible for biochemical, cell metabolism and physiological activities. The oxidative stress mediated by fenvalerate at sub lethal concentrations after 28 days of exposure of Zebra fish. Following 28 days of exposure of pesticide, catalase, superoxide dismutase, aspartate amino transferases, alanine amino transferase, alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase were assessed. Results revealed reduction of superoxide dismutase activity after 28 days of exposure in sub lethal concentration of fenvalerate in liver and gills. In liver, catalase activity was found to be less in fenvalerate exposed fish than control fish. In liver, increase of 75.75% aspartate amino transferase and 38% increase in alanine amino transferase in gills. SGPT activity was relatively higher than SGOT suggests more contribution of phyruvalate than oxaloacetate formation. Fenvalerate induced changes in acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activity in the liver and gills of Zebra fish after four weeks of exposure. Fenvalerate induced expression of various stress proteins in gill, liver, followed by muscle. Some proteins lost its intensity due to fenvalerate toxicity. Result revealed that enzyme assays and SDS-PAGE analysis for protein subunits determination is relevant tool to monitor stress in freshwater ecosystem. The findings suggest that in monitoring fenvalerate toxicity programme, enzyme activities can be potent diagnostic tool for fenvalerate induced toxicity."
0,"Distribution of Se and Hg in sarcoplasmic, myofibrillar and alkali-soluble protein fractions extracted from muscle tissue of tuna, swordfish and salmon (wild vs. farmed) is investigated for the first time. SEC-UV-ICP-MS analyses revealed that Se and Hg are mostly bound to proteins of 2-12 kDa and up to 574 kDa, respectively. Moreover, Se and Hg appeared associated to proteins of same molecular weight, evidencing that Se-Hg interaction may occur at the level of the fish tissue evaluated. Important differences were found between farmed and wild salmon, suggesting the effect of the type of feed and growing conditions on Se and Hg content and their distribution through protein fractions. Finally, Se speciation studies performed by HPLC-ICP-MS and confirmed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS showed SeMeSeCys as the only Se specie found in soluble, sarcoplasmic, myofibrillar and alkali-soluble proteins of all fishes analysed, except in soluble proteins extracted from tuna, where SeMet was also identified."
0,"Fish nocardiosis is a chronic granulomatous bacterial disease and three pathogens have been reported so far, including Nocardia asteroids, N. seriolae and N. salmonicida. However, the absence of antigen markers is a bottleneck for developing effective vaccines against fish nocardiosis. In this study, the antigenicity of whole-cell protein of these three pathogenic Nocardia species were profiled by immunoproteomic analysis and 7 common immunogenic proteins were identified as follows: molecular chaperone DnaK (DnaK), molecular chaperone GroEL (GroEL), 30 S ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA), TerD family protein (TerD), FHA domain-containing protein (FHA), 50 S ribosomal protein L7/L12 (RplL) and PspA/IM30 family protein (PspA). Furthermore, the DNA vaccine encoding FHA gene against fish nocardiosis was developed and its efficacy was investigated in hybrid snakehead. The results suggested that it needed at least 7 d to transport pcDNA-FHA DNA vaccine from injected muscle to head kidney, spleen and liver and stimulate host's immune system for later protection. In addition, non-specific immunity paraments (serum lysozyme (LYZ), peroxidase (POD), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities), specific antibody (IgM) titers production and immune-related genes (MHCIα, MHCIIα, CD4, CD8α, IL-1β and TNFα) were used to evaluate the immune response induced in pcDNA-FHA vaccinated hybrid snakehead, it proved that all these mentioned immune activities were significantly enhanced after immunization. The results also showed hybrid snakehead vaccinated with pcDNA-FHA had higher survival rate (79.33%) compared with the controls after challenge with N. seriolae, indicating that the pcDNA-FHA DNA vaccine can supply immune protection against N. seriolae infection. Taken together, this study may warrant further development of these common immunogenic proteins as the antigens for vaccine or diagnosis and facilitate the prevention and treatment of fish nocardiosis."
0,"Pharmaceutical drugs and their metabolites are detected in aquatic ecosystems and have been reported to cause ecotoxicological consequences to resident aquatic organisms. The study investigated the effects of acute and long-term exposure to verapamil on activities of acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes as well as mRNA expression of stress-related genes in brain and muscle tissues of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. The 96h LC<sub>50</sub> of verapamil to O. niloticus was 2.29mgL<sup>-1</sup>. Exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of verapamil (0.14, 0.29 and 0.57mgL<sup>-1</sup>) for period of 15, 30, 45 and 60days, led to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activities in the brain and muscle of the fish. The activities of the oxidative enzymes such as the catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were also inhibited in both the tissues while there was an increase in the activities of glutathione-S-transferase and reduced glutathione in the muscle after 15 days at 0.29mgL<sup>-1</sup>. Lipid peroxidation and carbonyl protein showed elevated level, indicating a positive correlation with both time and concentration. The activities of energy-related biomarker (Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) in both the tissues were significantly inhibited (p<0.05) compared with the control. Transcription of catalase (cat), superoxide dismutase (sod) and heat shock proteins 70 (hsp70) were up-regulated in both the tissues after the study period. Prolonged exposure to sub-lethal verapamil can result in oxidative stress, up-regulation of stress-related genes and neurotoxicity in O. niloticus."
0,"Autophagy is an important evolutionary conserved process in eukaryotic organisms for the turnover of intracellular substances. Recent studies revealed that autophagy displays circadian rhythms in mice and zebrafish. To date, there is no report focused on the rhythmic changes of autophagy in fish skeletal muscles upon nutritional deprivation. In this study, we examined the circadian rhythms of 158 functional genes in tilapia muscle in response to starvation. We found that 12 genes were involved in autophagy changed their rhythm after starvation. Among these genes, Atg4c, Bnip3la, Lc3a, Lc3b, Lc3c, and Ulk1a exhibited a daily rhythmicity in tilapia muscle, and Atg4b, becn1, bnip3la, bnip3lb, Lc3a, and ulk1b were significantly upregulated in response to starvation. The number of autophagosomes was dramatically increased in fasted fish, indicating that nutritional signals affect not only the muscular clock system but also its autophagy behavior. Administration of GSK4112, an activator of Nr1d1, altered rhythmic expression of both circadian clock genes and autophagy genes in tilapia muscle. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that nutritional deficiency affects both circadian regulation and autophagy activities in skeletal muscle."
0,"The effect of washing treatments (water and alkali washing) and alkali extraction/acid precipitation on the physicochemical and textural properties of striped catfish (Pangasius hypophthalmus) muscle protein was compared. Alkali extraction/acid precipitation process resulted in the highest protein recovery of 98.77% (dry weight basis) and lowest fat content of 0.98% (dry weight basis). The extractable proteins of fish protein isolates (FPI) at various ionic strengths (0 to 0.6 M NaCl) exhibited majority of protein at 38 kDa with trace amount of others. Unsaturated fatty acids, namely, oleic, linoleic, and docosahexaenoic acid, were greatly reduced in FPI. Water-washed mince (W) exhibited higher autolytic activity than mince (M), suggesting the presence of myofibril-bound proteinase(s). Autolytic activity was lowest in the FPI. Breaking force of striped catfish gels was greatly improved when set at 40 degrees C for 30 min, regardless of preparation treatment. The typical water washing process was effective to improve gel-forming ability of striped catfish. FPI gels contained the lower total sulfhydryl content, indicating the greater extent of disulfide bond formation as compared to that of washed mince. The FPI gels showed higher breaking force but lower deformation values than W and alkali-washed (AW) gels. Addition of NaCl improved deformation, but adversely affected breaking force of FPI gel. Whiteness of FPI gel increased with NaCl addition."
0,"Two peptides with antioxidant activity were isolated from <i>Pseudosciaena crocea</i> proteins. <i>Pseudosciaena crocea</i> muscle was hydrolyzed with neutral protease to obtain <i>Pseudosciaena crocea</i> protein hydrolysates (PCPH). After ultrafiltration through molecular weight cut-off membranes of 10, 5 and 3 kDa and assessment of free radical scavenging ability, the fraction (PCPH-IV) with the highest antioxidant activity was obtained. Several purification steps, i.e., ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, were applied to further purify PCPH-IV. Two antioxidant peptides with the amino acid sequences Ser-Arg-Cys-His-Val and Pro-Glu-His-Trp were finally identified by LC-MS/MS."
0,"Limb muscles are formed from migratory muscle precursor cells (MMPs) that delaminate from the ventral region of dermomyotomes and migrate into the limb bud. MMPs remain undifferentiated during migration, commencing differentiation into skeletal muscle after arrival in the limb. However, it is still unclear whether the developmental mechanisms of MMPs are conserved in teleost fishes. Here, we investigate the development of pectoral fin muscles in the teleost medaka Oryzias latipes. Expression of the MMP marker lbx1 is first observed in several somites prior to the appearance of fin buds. lbx1-positive cells subsequently move anteriorly and localize in the prospective fin bud region to differentiate into skeletal muscle cells. To address the developmental mechanisms underlying fin muscle formation, we knocked down tbx5, a gene that is required for fin bud formation. tbx5 morphants showed loss of fin buds, whereas lbx1 expression initiated normally in anterior somites. Unlike in normal embryos, expression of lbx1 was not maintained in migrating fin MMPs or within the fin buds. We suggest that fin MMPs appear to undergo two phases in their development, with an initial specification of MMPs occurring independent of fin buds and a second fin bud-dependent phase of MMP migration and proliferation. Our results showed that medaka fin muscle is composed of MMPs. It is suggested that the developmental mechanism of fin muscle formation is conserved in teleost fishes including medaka. Through this study, we also propose new insights into the developmental mechanisms of MMPs in fin bud formation."
0,"The olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, is a commercially important maricultured fish in China, Japan, and Korea. Low winter temperatures influence its survival and growth and affect the output of the aquaculture industry. Energy metabolism is essential for fish survival, and the central energy-regulating factor - 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) - plays an important role in responses to cold stress. However, the mechanism of AMPK pathway regulation in fish coping with cold stress remains poorly understood. In the present study, the expression of AMPK and its upstream (LKB1 and CaMKKβ) and downstream genes (SITR1, FOXO1A, and TFAM) in the brain, muscle, and heart was analyzed while the flounder was under cold stress (0.2 ± 0.2 °C). The results showed that low temperatures activated LKB1, CaMKKβ, and AMPK genes in the brain, and the activated AMPK induced expression of SITR1, FOXO1A, and TFAM. In the muscle tissue, the expression patterns of these genes presented a trend of initially decreasing and then increasing, and there was a delay in the response to low temperatures. At the cellular level, comparative analysis of the effects of the activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) and inhibitor compound C of the AMPK pathway demonstrated that cold stress was similar to AICAR, which activated the AMPK pathway with hysteresis. Thus, the regulation mechanism of AMPK under cold stress was preliminarily analyzed. In general, AMPK was involved not only in responses to low temperatures but also in energy regulation under cold stress."
0,"Cystatin C is an endogenous inhibitor of cysteine proteases and widely exist in organisms. Several studies in mammals have showed that Cystatin C plays critical role in the immune defense against microorganisms. It is also well known that some fish Cystatin C have important immune regulation functions in inflammatory responses. However, the function of fish Cystatin C in virus infection as well as its underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In the present study, a Cystatin C gene termed Ec-CysC was identified from orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides. The full-length of Ec-CysC cDNA was 817 bp with a 387 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encoded a 129-amino acid (aa) protein, including 18-aa signal peptide and 111-aa mature polypeptide. The deduced amino acid of Ec-CysC shared three conserved domains containing Glycine at the N-terminus region, QVVAG motif in the middle and PW motif near the C-terminus region. Transcription analysis of the Ec-CysC gene showed its expression in all twelve examined tissues including liver, spleen, kidney, brain, intestine, heart, skin, muscle, fin, stomach, gill and head kidney. Its expression following stimulation with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) was further tested in spleen, the relative expression of Ec-CysC was significantly up-regulated at 12 h post-infection. The subcellular localization experiment revealed that Ec-CysC was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm in Grouper Spleen (GS) cells. In vitro, Overexpression of Ec-CysC in GS cells significantly reduced the expression of viral genes, namely, ORF162, ORF049 and ORF072. Meanwhile, we found that overexpression of Ec-CysC resulted in upward trend of expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1β and IL8 during SGIV infection. Further, SGIV-inducible apoptosis and Caspase-3 activity were also weakened by overexpression Ec-CysC in fathead minnow (FHM) cells. These results indicated that Ec-CysC might have a deeper involvement in fish immune defense, and played important roles in inflammation and apoptosis induced by SGIV."
0,"Molecular chaperones [heat shock proteins (HSPs)] increase in response to rapid changes in temperatures, but long-term acclimation to cold temperature may also warrant elevations in HSPs. In fishes, cold acclimation increases mitochondrial density and oxidative stress in some tissues, which may increase demand for HSPs. We hypothesized that levels of HSPs, as well as sirtuins (SIRTs), NAD-dependent deacetylases that mediate changes in metabolism and responses to oxidative stress (including increases in HSPs), would increase during cold acclimation of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Transcript levels of hsp70, hsc70, hsp60 and hsp90-α, sirts1-4, as well as protein levels of HSP60, HSP90 and HSC70 were quantified in liver and pectoral adductor muscle of stickleback during cold acclimation from 20 °C to 8 °C. In liver, cold acclimation stimulated a transient increase in mRNA levels of hsp60 and hsc70. Transcript levels of sirt1 and sirt2 also increased in response to cold acclimation and remained elevated. In pectoral muscle, mRNA levels of hsp60, hsp90-α, hsc70 and sirt1 all transiently increased in response to cold acclimation, while levels of sirts2-4 remained constant or declined. Similar to transcript levels, protein levels of HSC70 increased in both liver and pectoral muscle. Levels of HSP90 also increased in liver after 4 weeks at 8 °C. HSP60 remained unchanged in both tissues, as did HSP90 in pectoral muscle. Our results indicate that while both HSPs and SIRTs increase in response to cold acclimation in stickleback, the response is tissue and isoform specific, likely reflecting differences in metabolism and oxidative stress."
0,"Salinity is an important parameter that affects survival and metabolism in fish. In fish, pituitary growth hormone (GH) regulates physiological functions including adaptation to different salinity as well as somatic growth. GH is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and exerts its function via binding to growth hormone receptor (GHR). As Kryptolebias marmoratus is a euryhaline fish, this species would be a useful model species for studying the adaptation to osmotic stress conditions. Here, we cloned GH, -GHR, somatolactin (SL), and somatolactin receptor (SLR) genes, and analyzed their expression patterns in different tissues and during early developmental stages by using real-time RT-PCR. We also further examined expression of them after acclimation to different salinity. Tissue distribution studies revealed that Km-GH and -SL mRNAs were remarkably expressed in brain and pituitary, whereas Km-GHR and -SLR mRNAs were predominantly expressed in liver, followed by gonad, muscle, pituitary, and brain. During embryonic developmental stages, the expression of their mRNA was increased at stage 3 (9 dpf). The Km-GH and -SL mRNA transcripts were constantly elevated until stage 5 (5h post hatch), whereas Km-GHR and -SLR mRNA levels decreased at this stage. After we transferred K. marmoratus from control (12 psu) to hyper-osmotic condition (hyperseawater, HSW; 33 psu), Km-GH, -SL, and GHR mRNA levels were enhanced. In hypo-osmotic conditions like freshwater (FW), Km-GH and -SL expressions were modulated 24 h after exposure, and Km-SLR transcripts were significantly upregulated. This finding suggests that Km-GH and -SL may be involved in the osmoregulatory mechanism under hyper-osmotic as well as hypo-osmotic stress. This is the first report on transcriptional modulation and relationship of GH, GHR, SL, and SLR during early development and after salinity stress. This study will be helpful to a better understanding on molecular mechanisms of adaptation response to salt stress in euryhaline fish."
0,"PGRP-SC2, the member of PGRP family, plays an important role in regulation of innate immune response. In this paper, a PGRP-SC2 gene of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (designated as On-PGRP-SC2) was cloned and its expression pattern under the infection of Streptococcus agalactiae was investigated. Sequence analysis showed main structural features required for amidase activity were detected in the deduced amino acid sequence of On-PGRP-SC2. In healthy tilapia, the On-PGRP-SC2 transcripts could be detected in all the examined tissues, with the most abundant expression in the muscle. When infected with S. agalactiae, there was a clear time-dependent expression pattern of On-PGRP-SC2 in the spleen, head kidney and brain. The assays for the amidase activity suggested that recombinant On-PGRP-SC2 protein had a Zn(2+)-dependent PGN-degrading activity. Moreover, our works showed that recombinant On-PGRP-SC2 protein could significantly reduce bacterial load in target organs attacked by S. agalactiae. These findings indicated that On-PGRP-SC2 may play important roles in the immune response to S. agalactiae in Nile tilapia. "
0,"The enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I is a major regulator of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in vertebrates. Numerous genome duplication events throughout evolution have given rise to three (in mammals) or multiple (in fish) genetically and functionally different isoforms of this enzyme. In particular, these isoforms represent a diversification of kinetic and regulatory properties stemming from mutations at the genomic and proteomic levels. Phylogenetic reconstructions reveal a comprehensive view of the CPT I family in vertebrates and genomic modifications leading to structural changes in proteins and functional differences between tissues and taxa. In a model fish species (rainbow trout), the presence of five CPT I isoforms suggests repeated duplication events in bony fishes and salmonids. Subsequently, an array of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions in the isoforms may contribute to a tissue-specific and a previously observed species-specific difference in the IC(50) for malonyl-CoA. Moreover, all five isoforms are expressed in trout at the mRNA level in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, kidney, and intestine. In general, transcript levels of the beta-isoforms were higher in muscle tissues, while levels of the alpha-isoforms were higher in other tissues. Rainbow trout also exhibit developmental plasticity in relative mRNA expression of CPT I isoforms from fry to juvenile to adult stage. Thus the evolution of CPT I has resulted in a very diverse family of isoforms. These differences represent a degree of specificity in the ability of species to regulate function at the protein and tissue levels, which, in turn, may allow for precise control of lipid oxidation in individual tissues during physiological perturbations."
0,"This study aimed to analyze the cold stress effects (in terms of hematology, energy reserves, and oxidative stress) in Piaractus mesopotamicus (pacú) and their mitigation by a Pyropia columbina red seaweed-supplemented diet. For this purpose, juvenile fish were fed with a control (CD) or a red seaweed-supplemented diet (RD) for 60 days, and then, the animals were exposed to a low temperature (14 °C) and a control temperature (24 °C) for 24 h. The cold shock generated an increase of hemoglobin levels in fish fed with both diets. In CD-fed fish, plasmatic triglycerides, cholesterol, and hepatic glycogen decreased after the thermal shock; meanwhile, the animals fed with RD showed decreased hepatic proteins, but increased cholesterol and hepatic glycogen. Regarding oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes augmented their activity in the liver, intestine, and gills; meanwhile, lipid oxidative damage was observed in the liver and intestine of fish exposed to 14 °C and fed with both diets. Pacú was sensitive to cold shock, but no mitigation effects were observed in fish fed with the supplemented diet. Further research should target higher concentrations of P. columbina in supplemented diets to take advantage of this valuable resource."
0,"The growing consumer demand for healthy products has encouraged the development of low-salt meat products. In this study, to develop low-salt restructured tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) meat products, citric acid was used to improve the properties of restructured tilapia products."
1,"In comparison with control restructured fish products (RP) and surimi products (SP), 0.2% citric acid-treated restructured fish products (RPC) and surimi products (SPC) showed a significant decrease in expressible water and water activity and a remarkable increase in whiteness, dry matter, hardness, chewiness, gumminess, and acceptability. Mechanistic studies suggested that citric acid significantly changed the content of total protein and myofibrillar proteins and promoted degradation of heavy myosin chains. Fourier-transform infrared and Raman spectra revealed the citric acid-mediated alteration in the peak intensities of amide I and amide II bands, which changed the secondary structures of RPC and SPC."

0,"Fish is among the cheapest and most promising sources of animal protein. The main edible portion of fish is muscle. This study explored the impact of dietary riboflavin on fish flesh quality and showed the possible role of muscle antioxidant defense in flesh quality in relation to dietary riboflavin. On-growing grass carp (initial average weight of 275.82 ± 0.57 g) were fed diets containing graded levels of riboflavin (0.63, 1.95, 3.98, 6.02, 7.96, and 10.04 mg kg-1 diet) for eight weeks. The results indicated that compared with the optimal riboflavin levels (3.98 and/or 6.02 mg riboflavin per kg diet), riboflavin deficiency treatment (0.63 mg riboflavin per kg diet) significantly reduced the muscle nutrients, including the protein, lipid, flavor amino acid, and total essential amino acid contents. Furthermore, the muscle shear force, pH value, and hydroxyproline concentration were reduced, while the muscle cooking loss and lactic acid content increased (P < 0.05). Compared with optimal riboflavin levels, the riboflavin deficiency treatment increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and protein carbonyl contents, while riboflavin treatments of 3.98-10.04 mg riboflavin per kg diet showed the lowest ROS and MDA contents (P < 0.05). Compared with the optimal riboflavin levels, the riboflavin deficiency treatment decreased the activities of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and reduced the glutathione (GSH) content (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the relative mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes, including CuZnSOD, CAT, GR and GPx, and antioxidant-related signaling molecules, including NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and casein kinase 2, were down-regulated, while those of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1b were up-regulated (P < 0.05). Collectively, the present study indicates that riboflavin deficiency treatment reduces the flesh quality, partly due to inhibition of the antioxidant defense through the Nrf2 signaling pathway, while optimal riboflavin levels reverse these negative effects."
0,"Understanding the functions of genes related to disease resistance and identifying polymorphisms in these genes are essential in molecular breeding for disease resistance. Viral nervous necrosis (VNN) is one of the major diseases in the Asian seabass, Lates calcarifer. Our previous works on QTL mapping, GWAS and cell-line transcriptome analysis of the Asian seabass after NNV challenge revealed that the gene GAB3 might be a candidate gene for VNN resistance. In this study, we cloned and characterized GAB3, and identified SNPs in the gene of the Asian seabass. The cDNA of the gene was 2165 bp, containing an ORF of 1674 bp encoding 557 amino acids. The gene consisted of 10 exons and nine introns. It was ubiquitously expressed in normal fish. An analysis of the association between two SNPs in the second intron and NNV resistance in 1035 fish descended from 43 families revealed that the two SNPs were significantly associated with VNN resistance. After NNV infection, the expression of GAB3 was significantly increased in the brain, spleen, muscle and gut, and was suppressed in the liver. The GAB3 protein was localized in the nucleus. Overexpression of GAB3 with specific GAB3-pcDNA was positively correlated to increased viral RNA and titer in NNV-infected Asian seabass cells. Our study provides new evidence to support that GAB3 may be an important gene related to NNV resistance. In addition, the SNPs provide DNA markers for the selection of candidate genes resistance to NNV at the juvenile stage of Asian seabass."
0,"This study examined the effect of peanut and cod proteins on post-damage skeletal muscle repair, compared with casein. We hypothesized that because of their high arginine content, these proteins would improve the resolution of inflammation and muscle mass recovery following injury. One hundred and twenty-eight male Wistar rats were assigned to isoenergetic diets composed of casein and peanut (experiment 1) or cod protein (experiment 2). After 21 days of feeding, one tibialis anterior muscle (TA) was injured with bupivacaine, while the contralateral TA was injected with saline (sham muscle). Measurements were taken at days 0, 3, 14, and 24 post-injury. Compared with casein, peanut protein reduced muscle mass at days 0 (-12%, p = 0.005) and 14 post-injury in the injured muscle (-13%, p = 0.04), and lowered myofiber cross-sectional area in both the sham (-21%, p = 0.008) and injured muscles (-26%, p = 0.05) at day 24 post-injury, showing that peanut protein has a weak potential to support muscle growth. At day 14 post-injury, muscle mass in the sham (13%, p = 0.02) and injured muscles (12%, p = 0.01) was higher in cod-protein-fed rats, indicating better muscle mass recovery, than in casein-fed rats. Cod protein tended (p = 0.06) to decrease the density of neutrophils (-24%) at day 14 post-injury in the injured muscle, and to decrease the density of ED1(+) macrophages at day 24 post-injury in both sham (-29%, p = 0.03) and injured (-40%, p = 0.01) muscles. No effects were observed for peanut protein. These data indicate that cod protein is better for promoting growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle after trauma, partly because of the improved resolution of inflammation."
0,"The metallothionein-2 (MT-2) gene was isolated from the mandarin fish, one of the most important industrial aquatic animals in China, by using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The deduced amino acid sequence of MT-2 comprised 60 amino acids and showed approximately 62.3% identity to human metallothionein. Its promoter region was amplified by thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL-PCR). The MT-2 gene consists of 3 exons and 2 introns, extending approximately 900 bp of genomic sequence. Phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that MT-2 formed a clade with fish metallothionein. The promoter region contained 5 putative metal-regulatory elements (MREs) and 1 TATA box. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that MT-2 transcripts were significantly increased in the brain and gills and were stable in the muscles, liver, and trunk kidney in Cd(2+)-stimulated fish. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that the protein of the MT-2 gene was expressed mainly in the gills, liver, heart, trunk kidney, muscle, and intestine; it was weakly detected in the brain and head kidney. Moreover, the MT-2 protein was immunohistochemically detected in the cytoplasm in the liver and trunk kidney. All the above results revealed that the mandarin fish MT-2 would be a useful biomarker for metal pollution."
0,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of µ-calpain oxidation on Coregonus peled myofibrillar protein degradation. In the present study, a hydroxyl radical oxidation system was selected to investigate oxidative modification on µ-calpain activity and its degradation on C. peled myofibrillar protein. When subjected to oxidation, the carbonyl content of µ-calpain significantly increased with the increasing of oxidation levels, and oxidation modification promoted the µ-calpain activity. Incubation of C. peled myofibrillar protein with oxidized µ-calpain resulted in the enhanced degradation of myosin heavy chains, actin, and troponin T, but the degradation of desmin at higher levels of oxidation was slightly inhibited, based on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting. This study suggests that oxidation treatment of µ-calpain could accelerate myofibrillar proteolysis through regulating the enzyme activity during postmortem aging. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Endogenous proteases, especially µ-calpain, are reported to be involved in fish softening during early postmortem storage, which is critical to muscle quality. The cysteine residues of proteins are particularly sensitive to oxidation. The investigation of the effect of oxidation on µ-calpain (a cysteine protease) activity allows for the monitoring of its role in the postmortem proteolysis of fish myofibrils and the associated softening of fish meat, in an attempt to minimize this softening."
0,"Stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP-2) is a novel and unusual member of the stomatin gene superfamily. In this study, we obtained a full-length SLP-2 (SmSLP-2) cDNA from turbot (Scopthalmus maximus) spleen cDNA library. The cDNA sequence of SmSLP-2 contains a 5'-UTR of 107 bp, an ORF of 1050 bp, and a 3'-UTR of 959 bp. The ORF encodes a putative protein of 349 residues, which has a calculated molecular mass of 38.7 kDa. The SmSLP-2 protein possesses a prohibitin-homology (PHB) domain (residues 40 to 198) and shares 72.4-87.6% overall sequence identity with that of the teleost species. The highest expression of SmSLP-2 mRNA was found in the skin, followed by the head kidney, gut, spleen, liver, heart, gill and muscle. Moreover, both viral and bacterial pathogen infection resulted in the up-regulation of SmSLP-2 mRNA in the turbot head kidney and spleen in vivo. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that the SmSLP-2 proteins are mainly located in the peripheral membrane of ZF4 cells. This study also demonstrated that SmSLP-2 modulates IL-2 expression via active NFκB signaling pathway, and is possibly involved in host immune defense against bacterial and viral pathogens. "
0,"Thermal processing is an inevitable part of the processing and preparation of meat and meat products for human consumption. However, thermal processing techniques, both commercial and domestic, induce modifications in muscle proteins which can have implications for their digestibility. The nutritive value of muscle proteins is closely related to their digestibility in the gastrointestinal tract and is determined by the end products that it presents in the assimilable form (amino acids and small peptides) for the absorption. The present review examines how different thermal processing techniques, such as sous-vide, microwave, stewing, roasting, boiling, frying, grilling, and steam cooking, affect the digestibility of muscle proteins in the gastrointestinal tract. By altering the functional and structural properties of muscle proteins, thermal processing has the potential to influence the digestibility negatively or positively, depending on the processing conditions. Thermal processes such as sous-vide can induce favourable changes, such as partial unfolding or exposure of cleavage sites, in muscle proteins and improve their digestibility whereas processes such as stewing and roasting can induce unfavourable changes, such as protein aggregation, severe oxidation, cross linking or increased disulfide (S-S) content and decrease the susceptibility of proteins during gastrointestinal digestion. The review examines how the underlying mechanisms of different processing conditions can be translated into higher or lower protein digestibility in detail. This review expands the current understanding of muscle protein digestion and generates knowledge that will be indispensable for optimizing the digestibility of thermally processed muscle foods for maximum nutritional benefits and optimal meal planning."
0,"Beclin-1 is an essential autophagic regulator that plays diverse roles in physiology and disease. However, reports about the function of fish Beclin-1 during pathogen infection are still very limited. In this study, a Beclin-1 homolog (EcBeclin-1) from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) was identified and its roles in viral infection were investigated. EcBeclin-1 encoded 447amino acids protein with a BH3 domain, a CCD domain and an ECD domain, which shared high identities (97%-82%) with reported Beclin-1 proteins from mammal to fish. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that EcBeclin-1 was predominantly expressed in brain and muscle of healthy grouper. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that EcBeclin-1 was co-localized with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in grouper spleen cells (EAGS). After red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infection in vitro, EcBeclin-1 transcript was significantly up-regulated, implying that EcBeclin-1 might be involved in viral infection. Furthermore, the in vitro studies of EcBeclin-1 overexpression promoted RGNNV induced autophagy, as well as the expression of coat protein (CP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The overexpression of EcBeclin-1 suppressed the expressions of interferon pathway-related factors, inflammatory-related factors and activities of NF-κB and ISRE. Additionally, EcBeclin-1 could interact with EcBcl-xL in vitro. These data suggest that EcBeclin-1 affect viral replication through modulating IFN and inflammatory responses, as well as virus-induced cell death, which will help us to further explore the immune response of fish during viral infection."
0,"An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary lipid sources on growth performance, fatty acid composition, rate-limiting enzyme activities and gene expression related to lipid metabolism in large yellow croaker (Larmichthys crocea). Five iso-nitrogenous and iso-lipidic experimental diets were formulated to contain different lipid sources, such as fish oil (FO), soybean oil (SO), linseed oil (LO), rapeseed oil (RO) and peanut oil (PO), respectively. Triplicate groups of 50 fish (initial weight 13.77±0.07g) were stocked in 15 floating net cages (1.5m×1.5m×2.0m). Fish fed the diets containing RO and LO had lower weight gain and specific growth rates than those fed the FO, SO and PO diets. Survival, feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio, hepatosomatic index, viscerasomatic index and condition factor were not significantly affected by different dietary lipid sources. Fish fed the diet containing FO had higher lipid content in whole body compared with the other groups, whereas fish fed the SO diet had the lowest muscle lipid content. Fatty acid profiles of muscle and liver reflected the fatty acid composition of the diets. Plasma glucose, triglyceride, and the enzymatic activity of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were significantly influenced by different dietary lipid sources, while total protein, cholesterol, superoxide dismutase or malondialdehyde in plasma were not affected by the different dietary lipid sources. Fish fed the LO diet had lower adipose triglyceride lipase and fatty acid synthase activities in liver than those fed the diets containing FO and RO, while the LO diet resulted in the highest hepatic carnitine palmitoultransferase-1 activity. Hepatic gene relative expression of adipose triglyceride lipase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 in fish fed PO diet was significantly higher than all other groups, whereas fish fed the SO and LO diets had lower relative expression levels of lipoprotein lipase than the other groups. The highest relative expression levels of fatty acid synthase and acyl-CoA diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 were observed in the FO group, while the highest relative expression of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase occurred in fish fed the FO and RO diets. In summary, based on the growth performance, FO and SO appear to be suitable lipid sources for large yellow croaker, with the findings of this study also providing a molecular insight into the role of lipid metabolic mechanism in response to different dietary lipid sources."
0,"Calreticulin (CRT) is a highly conserved and multi-functional protein with diverse localizations. CRT has lectin-like properties and possesses important immunological activities in mammalian. In teleost, very limited studies on CRT immunologic function have been documented. In the present study, a CRT homologue (SsCRT) was cloned, identified and characterized from black rockfish, Sebastes schlegeli, an important aquaculture species in East Asia. The full length of SsCRT cDNA is 2180 bp and encoded a polypeptide of 425 amino acids. SsCRT contains a signal peptide, three distinct structural and functional domains (N-, P- and C-domains), and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval signal sequence (KDEL). The deduced amino acid sequence of SsCRT shares 89-92% overall sequence identities with the CRT proteins of several fish species. SsCRT was distributed ubiquitously in all the detected tissues and was highly expressed in the spleen, muscle and liver. After the infection of fish extracellular bacterial pathogen Vibrio anguillarum and intracellular bacterial pathogen Edwardsiella tarda, the mRNA transcripts of SsCRT in spleen, liver, and head kidney were significantly up-regulated. The expression patterns were time-dependent and tissue-dependent. Recombinant SsCRT (rSsCRT) exhibited apparent binding activities against different bacteria and PAMPs. In vivo studies showed that the expressions of multiple immune-related genes such as TNF13B, IL-1β, IL-8, SAA, Hsp70, and ISG15 in head kidney were significantly enhanced when black rockfish were treated with rSsCRT. Furthermore, rSsCRT reduced pathogen dissemination and replication in fish kidney and spleen. These results indicated that SsCRT served as an immune receptor to recognize and eliminate the invading pathogens, which played a vital role in the immune response of Sebastes schlegeli. These findings provide new insights into understanding the roles of CRT proteins in immune response and pathogen infection in teleost."
0,"The activin type IIB receptor (Acvr2b) is the cell surface receptor for multiple transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily ligands, several of which regulate muscle growth in mammals. To investigate the role of the Acvr2b signaling pathway in the growth and development of skeletal muscle in teleost fish, transgenic rainbow trout (RBT; Oncorhynchus mykiss) expressing a truncated form of the acvr2b-2a (acvr2b(▵)) in muscle tissue were produced. High levels of acvr2b(▵) expression were detected in the majority of P1 transgenic fish. Transgenic P1 trout developed enhanced, localized musculature in both the epaxial and hypaxial regions (dubbed 'six pack'). The F1 transgenic offspring did not exhibit localized muscle growth, but rather developed a uniform body morphology with greater girth, condition factor and increased muscle fiber hypertrophy. There was a high degree of variation in the mass of both P1 and F1 transgenic fish, with several fish of each generation exhibiting enhanced growth compared with other transgenic and control siblings. The 'six pack' phenotype observed in P1 transgenic RBT overexpressing acvr2b(▵) and the presence of F1 individuals with altered muscle morphology provides compelling evidence for the importance of TGF-β signaling molecules in regulating muscle growth in teleost fish."
0,"Fish sauce production relies on a natural fermentation process requiring 12-18 months for process completion. Virgibacillus sp. SK37 has been shown to be a potential strain for fish sauce acceleration. However, hydrolytic activity of proteinases bound at cell surface of this strain has not been well elucidated. Addition of 0.2 % CaCl(2) (w/w) in conjunction with starter cultures of Virgibacillus sp. SK 37 increased protein hydrolysis as measured by α-amino group content throughout fermentation (P < 0.05). Cell-bound proteinases from Virgibacillus sp. SK 37 were extracted into a free form by incubating the washed cells in Ca(2+)-free buffer at 37 °C for 2 h. Cell-bound proteinases revealed molecular mass of 19, 20, 22, 32, 34, and 44 kDa based on a synthetic peptide zymogram. The proteinases showed subtilisin-like serine characteristics with the highest activity at 50 °C and pH 8 and 11. Activity of the extracted proteinases increased ~4 times at ≥100 mM CaCl(2). In addition, CaCl(2) enhanced thermal stability of the extracted proteinases. Enzymes showed proteolytic activity in either the absence or presence of 10 and 25 % NaCl toward fish muscle, soy protein isolate, and casein substrates. Cell-bound proteinases were likely to play an important role in protein hydrolysis during fish sauce fermentation."
0,"Despite the potential of vegetable oils as aquafeed ingredients, a major drawback associated with their utilization is the inferior level of beneficial n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). Echium oil (EO), which is rich in stearidonic acid (SDA, 18:4n-3), could potentially improve the deposition of n-3 LC-PUFA as the biosynthesis of LC-PUFA is enhanced through bypassing the rate-limiting ∆6 desaturation step. We report for the first time an attempt to investigate whether the presence of a desaturase (Fads2) capable of ∆4 desaturation activities and an elongase (Elovl5) will leverage the provision of dietary SDA to produce a higher rate of LC-PUFA bioconversion. Experimental diets were designed containing fish oil (FO), EO or linseed oil (LO) (100FO, 100EO, 100LO), and diets which comprised equal mixtures of the designated oils (50EOFO and 50EOLO) were evaluated in a 12-week feeding trial involving striped snakeheads (Channa striata). There was no significant difference in growth and feed conversion efficiency. The hepatic fatty acid composition and higher expression of fads2 and elovl5 genes in fish fed EO-based diets indicate the utilization of dietary SDA for LC-PUFA biosynthesis. Collectively, this resulted in a higher deposition of muscle eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) compared to LO-based diets. Dietary EO improved the ratio of n-3 LC-PUFA to n-6 LC-PUFA in fish muscle, which is desirable for human populations with excessive consumption of n-6 PUFA. This study validates the contribution of SDA in improving the content of n-3 LC-PUFA and the ratio of EPA to arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6) in a freshwater carnivorous species. "
0,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs), as important pattern recognition receptors, represent a significant component of fish immune systems and play an important role in resisting the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms. The TLR5 subfamily contains two types of TLR5, the membrane form of TLR5 (TLR5M) and the soluble form of TLR5 (TLR5S), whose detailed functions have not been completely elucidated. In the present study, we first identified two genes, <i>TLR5M</i> (<i>ToTLR5M</i>) and <i>TLR5S</i> (<i>ToTLR5S</i>), from golden pompano (<i>Trachinotus ovatus</i>). The full-length <i>ToTLR5M</i> and <i>ToTLR5S</i> cDNA are 3644 bp and 2329 bp, respectively, comprising an open reading frame (ORF) of 2673 bp, encoding 890 amino acids, and an ORF of 1935 bp, encoding 644 amino acids. Both the <i>ToTLR5s</i> possess representative TLR domains; however, only <i>ToTLR5M</i> has transmembrane and intracellular TIR domains. Moreover, the transcription of two <i>ToTLR5s</i> was significantly upregulated after stimulation by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and flagellin in both immune-related tissues (liver, intestine, blood, kidney, and skin) and nonimmune-related tissue (muscle). Furthermore, the results of bioinformatic and promoter analysis show that the transcription factors GATA-1 (GATA Binding Protein 1), C/EBPalpha (CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein Alpha), and ICSBP (Interferon (IFN) consensus sequence binding protein) may play a positive role in moderating the expression of two <i>ToTLR5s</i>. Overexpression of <i>ToTLR5M</i> and <i>ToTLR5S</i> notably increases <i>NF-κB</i> (nuclear factor kappa-B) activity. Additionally, the binding assay revealed that two rToTLR5s can bind specifically to bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) containing <i>Vibrio harveyi</i>, <i>Vibrio anguillarum</i>, <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Photobacterium damselae</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i>, LPS, poly(I:C), flagellin, and peptidoglycan (PGN). In conclusion, the present study may help to elucidate the function of ToTLR5M/S and clarify their possible roles in the fish immune response to bacterial infection."
0,"5'adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of energy homeostasis in eukaryotes. This study identified expansions in the AMPK-α, -β and -γ families of salmonid fishes due to a history of genome duplication events, including five novel salmonid-specific AMPK subunit gene paralogue pairs. We tested the hypothesis that the expanded AMPK gene system of salmonids is transcriptionally regulated by growth and immunological status. As a model, we studied immune-stimulated coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) from three experiment groups sharing the same genetic background, but showing highly-divergent growth rates and nutritional status. Specifically, we compared wild-type and GH-transgenic fish, the latter achieving either enhanced or wild-type growth rate via ration manipulation. Transcript levels for the fifteen unique salmonid AMPK subunit genes were quantified in skeletal muscle after stimulation with bacterial or viral mimics to alter immune status. These analyses revealed a constitutive up-regulation of several AMPK-α and -γ subunit-encoding genes in GH-transgenic fish achieving accelerated growth. Further, immune stimulation caused a decrease in the expression of several AMPK subunit-encoding genes in GH-transgenic fish specifically. The dynamic expression responses observed suggest a role for the AMPK system in balancing energetic investment into muscle growth according to immunological status in salmonid fishes."
0,"Μeagre (Argyrosomus regius) is a newly introduced species in the aquaculture sector characterized by high growth rates and good nutritional value. However, the optimum conditions such as water temperature for the rearing of this species are still under research. The aim of the present study was to investigate several biochemical responses in the heart, muscle, liver, and intestine of meagre reared under different water temperatures (17, 23, and 26 °C) in comparison to the initial acclimation temperature at 20 °C. To assess its cellular stress response, the molecular markers of Hsp70 and Hsp90 induced levels, p38 MAPK and p44/42 MAPK phosphorylated levels, ubiquitin conjugates, and Bcl-2 levels were determined. Moreover, to investigate its antioxidant defense, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase were measured. The obtained results in meagre showed a distinct tissue-specific response regarding the variations observed in the studied parameters under different acclimation temperatures. Specifically, most examined tissues presented a decrease in the levels of the examined markers compared to 20 °C, while in the intestine, an increase of Hsp70 and p38 MAPK levels was observed at 23 and 26 °C. However, data on the final weight and length of the fish lead to the conclusion that high water temperatures such as 26 °C might be the best for the rearing of this species. Therefore, it is assumed that the observed differential molecular responses may act in a cell-protective way at all temperatures, irrespectively of the effect of temperature on growth parameters."
0,"In this study, the proteome profile of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) muscle was analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and tandem mass spectrometry with the aim of providing a more detailed characterization of its specific protein expression profile. A highly populated and well-resolved 2-DE map of the sea bass muscle tissue was generated, and the corresponding protein identity was provided for a total of 49 abundant protein spots. Upon Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, the proteins mapped in the sea bass muscle profile were mostly related to glycolysis and to the muscle myofibril structure, together with other biological activities crucial to fish muscle metabolism and contraction, and therefore to fish locomotor performance. The data presented in this work provide important and novel information on the sea bass muscle tissue-specific protein expression, which can be useful for future studies aimed to improve seafood traceability, food safety/risk management and authentication analysis. This work is also important for understanding the proteome map of the sea bass toward establishing the animal as a potential model for muscular studies. "
0,"Water volume is a key parameter affecting the individual rearing of male Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens Regan, 1910). In this study, minimization of water volume was pursued by assessing growth, feed utilization, digestive enzyme activities, color coordinates, muscle quality, and carcass composition. One-month-old solid-red male fish (0.97 ± 0.01 g initial body weight) were distributed individually into glass aquaria with five alternative water volumes (100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mL), comprising 15 fish per treatment (n = 15), over 8 weeks duration. No mortality of the reared fish was found during the study. Growth performance and feed utilization of the fish reared in 150 mL water were superior to the other treatments. The water volume significantly affected specific activities of the digestive enzymes (P ˂ 0.05), except for amylase, and no differences in enzyme activities were observed between fish reared in 150 and in 300 mL water. The preferred treatment maintained skin lightness (L*) and had the highest redness (a* and a*/b*) among the treatments. Protein synthesis (RNA concentration) and its turnover rate (RNA/protein ratio) and myosin and actin in muscle also benefited from this treatment. Carcass composition, in terms of moisture, crude protein, and crude ash, was maintained, but the amount of crude lipid fluctuated with water volume. Based on our experiments, the preferred minimal water volume for individual rearing of male Siamese fighting fish should be about 150 mL."
0,"Scinderin like (ScinL) gene is a unique gelsolin family gene found only in fish. In this study ScinL gene was cloned in olive flounder for the first time and characterized its expression and function. Flounder ScinL cDNA consists of 2911 nucleotides encoding a putative protein of 720 amino acids (79.4 kDa). In phylogenetic analysis, flounder ScinL is closely related to ScinL of zebra fish, anableps, and fugu with the similarity of 51-72%. Fish ScinLs are positioned between gelsolin and scinderin of other species. Flounder ScinL protein has the highly conserved actin and PIP2 binding sites, Ca(2+) coordination site, and a C-terminal latch helix preventing the activation of ScinL protein in the absence of Ca(2+). Putative binding sites for NFAT and AP-1 were found in 5' flanking region. Constitutive ScinL expression was found in most organs and the expression level was higher in gill, head kidney, trunk kidney, spleen and skin than muscle, stomach, intestine and brain. In Q-PCR analysis ScinL and CYP1A1 gene expression were significantly upregulated by BaP in head kidney in vivo and in vitro, and in macrophage cells. Upregulated ScinL expression by BaP was blocked by EGTA, indicating a calcium dependent regulation of ScinL expression."
0,"A feeding trial was conducted to test the effects of partial replacement of fishmeal (FM) protein and fish oil (FO) with partially defatted black soldier fly, <i>Hermetia illucens</i> insect protein, and oil, respectively, on growth performance, immune response, gut and skin barrier status, and flesh quality in juvenile barramundi. Four isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets used in the study were a control diet based on FM, 30% FM replaced with <i>H. illucens</i> protein (HiP), 30% FO replaced with <i>H. illucens</i> oil (HiO), and both 30% FM and 30% FO replaced with <i>H. illucens</i> protein and oil (HiPO). Diets were fed twice a day to satiety in triplicated groups of barramundi with an initial body weight of 1.74 ± 0.15 g per fish. At the end of the trial, growth and feed utilization indices were found insignificant (<i>p</i> > 0.05) between the test diets and control. A significant increase in bactericidal activity was observed in fish fed the HiP diet while serum lysozyme activity was unchanged. Stress-related heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSP90) did not differ significantly among the test diets while immune-relevant genes (IL-1β and IL-10) were significantly upregulated in HiP and HiOP groups. The number of mucin cells were increased in the gut and skin of HiP and HiOP fed fish when compared to the control diet. The total fatty acid compositions (∑SFA, ∑MUFA, ∑PUFA, ∑n-3, and ∑n-6) in the muscles of barramundi were not significantly influenced with <i>H. illucens</i> protein and oil diets when compared to the control."
0,"Temperature is a key environmental factor, and understanding how its fluctuations affect physiological and metabolic processes is critical for fish. The present study characterizes the energy response and fatty acid metabolism in Onychostoma macrolepis exposed to low temperature (10 °C). The results demonstrated that cold stress remarkably disrupted the energy homeostasis of O. macrolepis, then the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) could strategically mobilize carbohydrates and lipids. In particular, when the O. macrolepis were faced with cold stress, the lipolysis was stimulated along with the enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation for energy, while the fatty acid synthesis was supressed in the early stage. Additionally, the fatty acid composition analysis suggested that saturated fatty acid (SFA) might accumulate while monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in storage lipids (mainly containing non-polar lipid, NPL) could be utilized to supply energy during cold acclimation. Altogether, this study may provide some meritorious for understanding the cold-tolerant mechanism of fish in the viewpoint of energy balance combined with fatty acid metabolism, and thus to contribute to this species rearing in fish farms in the future."
0,"Bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) belong to the lipid transfer protein/lipopolysaccharide-binding protein family and play a critical role in the innate immune response to Gram-negative bacteria. In the present study, a novel BPI/LBP from blunt snout bream, Megalobrama amblycephala (maBPI/LBP) was isolated by RACE techniques. The open reading frame (ORF) of maBPI/LBP gene encoded a polypeptide of 474 amino acids with a putative 18-aa hydrophobic signal peptide. Structurally, the maBPI/LBP showed highly similar to those of BPI/LBPs from invertebrate and teleost, LBPs and BPIs from mammal, which contained an N-terminal BPI/LBP/CETP domain BPI1 with a LPS-binding domain, a C-terminal BPI/LBP/CETP domain BPI2, and proline-rich domain. The homologous identities of deduced amino acid sequences displayed that the maBPI/LBP possessed significant similarity (96.61% and 90.07%) with those of grass carp and common carp, respectively. The recombinant protein of maBPI/LBP showed effectively kill Gram-negative bacteria. The maBPI/LBP gene was expressed in a wide range of normal tested tissues, with the highest expression levels in the kidney. The experiments revealed that the mRNA expression of maBPI/LBP in spleen considerably up-regulated from 2 h to 8 h post LPS stimulation, and peaked rapidly at 2 h (7.40-fold, P < 0.05), which confirmed that maBPI/LBP was the absolute sensitive to LPS stimulation. Furthermore, the level of maBPI/LBP mRNA expression reached the maximum for a second time at 24 h after LPS stimulation. These results suggested that maBPI/LBP was a constitutive and inducible acute-phase protein contributing to the host immune defense against pathogenic bacterial infection in M. amblycephala. This study will further our understanding of the function of BPI/LBP and the molecular mechanism of innate immunity in teleost."
0,"This study reports the antioxidant property and molecular mechanism of a tryptophan-tagged peptide derived from a teleost fish Channa striatus of serine threonine-protein kinase (STPK). The peptide was tagged with tryptophan to enhance the antioxidant property of STPK and named as IW13. The antioxidant activity of IW13 peptide was investigated using in vitro methods such as DPPH, ABTS, superoxide anion radical scavenging and hydrogen peroxide scavenging assay. Furthermore, to investigate the toxicity and dose response of IW13 peptide on antioxidant defence in vitro, L6 myotubes were induced with generic oxidative stress due to exposure of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). IW13 peptide exposure was found to be non-cytotoxic to L6 cells in the tested concentration (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 μM). Also, the pre-treatment of IW13 peptide decreased the lipid peroxidation level and increased glutathione enzyme activity. IW13 peptide treatment upregulated the antioxidant enzyme genes: GPx (glutathione peroxidase), GST (glutathione S transferase) and GCS (glutamine cysteine synthase), in vitro in L6 myotubes and in vivo in zebrafish larvae against the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress. The results demonstrated that IW13 renders protection against the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress through a cellular antioxidant defence mechanism by upregulating the gene expression, thus enhancing the antioxidant activity in the cellular or organismal level. The findings exhibited that the tryptophan-tagged IW13 peptide from STPK of C. striatus could be a promising candidate for the treatment of oxidative stress-associated diseases."
0,"Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) is a multifunctional adaptor protein primarily involved in both bacterial defense and antiviral immunity in living organisms. However, the knowledge on TRAF3 in blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala), a freshwater fish with economic values, remained unclear. In the present study, we identified and characterized successfully Traf3 gene from M. amblycephala (maTraf3). The maTraf3 cDNA contained a 1722 bp open reading frame that encoded a protein of 573 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence comprised of a RING finger domain, two zinc finger motifs, a coiled-coil region and a MATH domain. Analysis of the transcriptional patterns of maTraf3 revealed that it was ubiquitously distributed in various tissues tested from M. amblycephala, with the abundance of expression in spleen and muscle. Following a challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila and lipopolysaccharide stimulation, the expression of maTraf3 was strongly enhanced at different time points in vitro and in vivo. MaTRAF3 was identified as a cytosolic protein and suggested to form aggregates or be associated with vesicles scattering in the cytoplasm. NF-κB transcription was activated by maTraf3 in reporter assay. The overexpression of maTraf3 produced high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α, implying its immune-regulatory role in M. amblycephala. Taken together, our results obtained in this study demonstrated the crucial role of maTraf3 in mediating host innate immune response to pathogen invasion via NF-κB signaling pathway, which might indicate a novel therapeutic approach to combat bacterial infection in fish."
0,"We explore the principles of pressure tolerance in enzymes of deep-sea fishes using lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) as a case study. We compared the effects of pressure on the activities of LDH from hadal snailfishes Notoliparis kermadecensis and Pseudoliparis swirei with those from a shallow-adapted Liparis florae and an abyssal grenadier Coryphaenoides armatus. We then quantified the LDH content in muscle homogenates using mass-spectrometric determination of the LDH-specific conserved peptide LNLVQR. Existing theory suggests that adaptation to high pressure requires a decrease in volume changes in enzymatic catalysis. Accordingly, evolved pressure tolerance must be accompanied with an important reduction in the volume change associated with pressure-promoted alteration of enzymatic activity ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mi>Δ</mi> <msubsup><mi>V</mi> <mtext>PP</mtext> <msup><mrow></mrow> <mo>∘</mo></msup> </msubsup> </mrow> </math> ). Our results suggest an important revision to this paradigm. Here, we describe an opposite effect of pressure adaptation-a substantial increase in the absolute value of <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mi>Δ</mi> <msubsup><mi>V</mi> <mtext>PP</mtext> <msup><mrow></mrow> <mo>∘</mo></msup> </msubsup> </mrow> </math> in deep-living species compared to shallow-water counterparts. With this change, the enzyme activities in abyssal and hadal species do not substantially decrease their activity with pressure increasing up to 1-2 kbar, well beyond full-ocean depth pressures. In contrast, the activity of the enzyme from the tidepool snailfish, L. florae, decreases nearly linearly from 1 to 2500 bar. The increased tolerance of LDH activity to pressure comes at the expense of decreased catalytic efficiency, which is compensated with increased enzyme contents in high-pressure-adapted species. The newly discovered strategy is presumably used when the enzyme mechanism involves the formation of potentially unstable excited transient states associated with substantial changes in enzyme-solvent interactions."
0,"The present study investigates the susceptibility of individual myofibrillar proteins from mackerel (Scomber scombrus) mince to undergo carbonylation reactions during chilled storage, and the antioxidant capacity of (+)-catechin to prevent oxidative processes of proteins. The carbonylation of each particular protein was quantified by combining the labelling of protein carbonyls by fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide (FTSC) with 1-D or 2-D gel electrophoresis. Alpha skeletal actin, glycogen phosphorylase, unnamed protein product (UNP) similar to enolase, pyruvate kinase, isoforms of creatine kinase, aldolase A and an isoform of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) showed elevated oxidation in chilled non-supplemented mince. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) was not carbonylated in chilled muscle, but an extensive MHC degradation was observed in those samples. The supplementation of catechin reduced protein oxidation and lipid oxidation in a concentration-dependent manner: control>25>100≈200ppm. Therefore, the highest catechin concentrations (100 and 200ppm) exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity. Catechin (200ppm) reduced significantly carbonylation of protein spots identified as glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme, isoforms of creatine kinase. Conversely, catechin was ineffective to inhibit the oxidation of actin and UNP similar to enolase. These results draw attention to the inefficiency of catechin to prevent actin oxidation, in contrast to the extremely high efficiency of catechin in inhibiting oxidation of lipids and other proteins."
0,"A novel potassium ion current induced by muscarinic stimulation (IKACh2) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, Carassius carassius; rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by application of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrations (10(-7)-10(-4) mol l(-1)). It can be distinguished from the classic IKACh, activated by the βγ-subunit of the Gi-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba(2+) ions and distinct current-voltage relationship with a very small inward current component. Ni(2+) ions (5 mmol l(-1)) and KB-R7943 (10(-5) mol l(-1)), non-selective blockers of the sodium-calcium exchange current (INCX), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the IKACh2. Therefore, IKACh2 was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the INCX. However, the current is not affected by either exclusion of intracellular Na(+) or extracellular Ca(2+), but is completely abolished by intracellular perfusion with K(+)-free solution. Atropine (10(-6) mol l(-1)), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the IKACh2. A selective antagonist of M2 cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10(-7) mol l(-1)) and an M3 antagonist, 4-DAMP (10(-9) mol l(-1)), decreased IKACh2 by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits Gi-protein coupled to M2 receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solution. It is concluded that IKACh2, induced by stimulation of M2 cholinoceptors and subsequent Gi-protein activation, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervation. "
0,"Carp muscle tissue is a valuable source of biologically active constituents known to positively influence human health. In this study, carp protein digests/hydrolysates generated by human/ porcine digestive enzymes were analysed for their angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEi) activity. The ex vivo digests and in vitro hydrolysates were used in a screening for ACEi peptides as well. Carp proteins were hydrolysed more rapidly by human gastrointestinal juices than by porcine enzymes. Sarcoplasmic protein fractions were digested/hydrolysed more easily than the myofibrillar ones. The inhibitory concentrations at 50% (IC50) for ex vivo digested sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein fractions were established at 1.50 and 1.04 mg/mL, respectively. While, for in vitro hydrolysed sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein fractions, the IC50 values were calculated as 2.57 and 1.12 mg/mL, respectively. The digested/hydrolysed samples of carp sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein fractions were separated by RP-HPLC-MS. Amino acid sequences were identified with the use of the LC-MS/MS method coupled with in silico systematic screening for ACEi peptides. ACEi peptides with IVY, IY, VY, ALPHA and VKAGF sequences were found in the carp digests/hydrolysates. In the ex vivo carp digest, an ACEi peptide TVY was also detected, while the ACEi peptide IW was identified in in vitro hydrolysate. Our study showed that different ACEi effects of carp digests and hydrolysates were generated with the use of human gastrointestinal and porcine enzymes."
0,"We investigated the effects of bioactive-peptides from hydrolysates of flounder fish muscle (FFM) on antioxidant activity. The hydrolysates were prepared by enzymatic reactions of FFM using eight commercial proteases such as papain, pepsin, trypsin, neutrase, alcalase, kojizyme, protamex, and α-chymotrypsin. The α-chymotrypsin hydrolysate showed the strongest antioxidant activity among the eight enzymatic hydrolysates. Further separation of the α-chymotrypsin hydrolysate was performed by ultrafiltration, gel filtration, and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Consequently, two novel peptides with high antioxidant activity were purified, and their amino acid sequences were determined (Val-Cys-Ser-Val [VCSV] and Cys-Ala-Ala-Pro [CAAP], respectively). The two peptides showed good scavenging activity against the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical (IC(50) values, 111.32 and 26.89 μM, respectively) and high cytoprotective activities against 2,2-azobis-(2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) without cytotoxicity and scavenged total reactive oxygen species in Vero cells. In particular, apoptotic bodies produced by AAPH dose-dependently decreased following treatment with the CAAP peptide. These results revealed firstly the two peptides with strong antioxidative effects from FFM."
0,"Marine pollution is one of today's most relevant problems. Public awareness has been raised about the harmful potential of heavy metals (HMs) accumulating in edible fish and possibly ending up in human diet through the food chain. This study aimed to characterize and evaluate As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb contents in four edible fish species from the western Mediterranean Sea. Liver and muscle toxic elements were determined by GF-AAS in Mullus surmuletus, Merluccius merluccius, Auxis rochei and Scomber japonicus from Almería Bay (Spain). Muscular composition, biometrics and trophic levels were also determined. The mean PTE concentration levels (mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, DW) in fish muscle tissue were: As (2.90-53.74), Cd (0.01-0.18), Cr (0.53-2.01), Cu (0.78-6.93), Ni (0.06-0.24), Pb (0.0-0.32). These concentrations did not exceed the maximum limits set by European legislation (Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006) for the intake of these marine species. Accumulation of toxic elements tends to be seen in the liver (As (7.31-26.77), Cd (0.11-8.59), Cr (0.21-2.94), Cu (2.64-16.90), Ni (0.16-1.03), Pb (0.0-0.99)). As was the element at highest risk in this Mediterranean region, especially due to red mullet values in muscle. The high As contents with living habits as benthic species that feed near the coast. HMs, especially muscle Cd contents, were associated with higher contents of lipids and organic matter, and bigger specimen size (length and weight), while As was linked to higher fish protein content. However, these relationships between potentially toxic elements (PTE) and biometric indices and body composition parameters depend on species. Finally, the THQ indices indicated that eating fish from Almería Bay poses no human health risk despite pollution from the Almería coastline."
0,"The growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system is the key promoter of growth in vertebrates; however, how this system modulates muscle mass in fish is just recently becoming elucidated. In fish, the GH induces muscle growth by modulating the expression of several genes belonging to the myostatin (MSTN), atrophy, GH, and IGF systems as well as myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). The GH controls the expression of igf1 via Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducers and activators of the transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling pathway, but it seems that it is not the major regulator. These mild effects of the GH on igf1 expression in fish muscle seem to be related with the presence of higher contents of truncated GH receptor1 (tGHR1) than full length GHR (flGHR1). IGFs in fish stimulate myogenic cell proliferation, differentiation, and protein synthesis through the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/TOR signaling pathways, concomitant with abolishing protein degradation and atrophy via the PI3K/AKT/FOXO signaling pathway. Besides these signaling pathways control the expression of several genes belonging to the atrophy and IGF systems. Particularly, IGFs and amino acid control the expression of igf1, thus, suggesting other of alternative signaling pathways regulating the transcription of this growth factor. The possible role of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) and the contribution of muscle-derived versus hepatic-produced IGF1 on fish muscle growth is also addressed. Thus, a comprehensive overview on the GH-IGF system regulating fish skeletal muscle growth is presented, as well as perspectives for future research in this field. "
0,"Many man-made chemical compounds are recognized as endocrine disruptors and once released into the environment are likely to spread and bioaccumulate in wild species. Due to their lipophilic nature, these substances pass through the cell membrane or bind to specific receptors activating physiological responses that in the long run can cause reproductive impairment, physiological disorders, including the occurrence of metabolic syndromes. One significant source of contamination is represented by the consumption of polluted food. As a consequence, different environmental pollutants, with similar or different modes of action, can accumulate in organisms and biomagnify along the food web, finally targeting humans. The aim of this study was to analyze, under controlled conditions, the effects induced by the consumption of contaminated diets, focusing on the effects exerted at hepatic level. Juvenile seabream were fed for 21days a diet enriched with different combinations of pollutants, nonylphenol (NP), tert-octylphenol (t-OP) and bisphenol A (BPA). The different diets containing 5mg/kg bw of each contaminant, were formulated as follows: NP+tOP, BPA+NP, BPA+tOP and NP+BPA+tOP (NBO). EDCs, at the doses administered, showed low biomagnification factor (BMF), suggesting that these pollutants hardly accumulate in muscles. The results obtained at hepatic level pinpointed the steatotic effect of all the administered diets, associated to a modulation of the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism (ppars, fas, lpl, and hsl). Results were compared to those obtained in previous studies in which fish were fed single pollutants evidencing that the administration of mixture of contaminants exerts a milder lipogenic effect, highlighting the contrasting/antagonistic interaction establishing among chemicals. Noteworthy was the setup of a new chromatographic method to detect the presence of the selected chemical in fish muscle and the application of Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analysis to evaluate pollutant-induced changes in the liver macromolecular building."
0,"Proteases in fish muscle often cause undesired softening of intact meat pieces during refrigerated storage or slow cooking. Several food-grade proteinaceous inhibitors can overcome this softening if properly delivered to the intracellular sites where proteases are located. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) were used to measure the translational diffusion of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled protease inhibitors into intact muscle fibers of halibut. Diffusion coefficients (D) of alpha-2-macroglobulin (720 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21 kDa), and cystatin (12 kDa) were measured in both muscle fibers and dilute aqueous solutions. On the time scale of the observation (35 min), cystatin and soybean trypsin inhibitor diffused through the cell membrane (sarcolemma) and sarcoplasm, but at a considerably slower rate (>10-fold difference) than in dilute aqueous solution. alpha-2-Macroglobulin did not diffuse into muscle cells within the time frame of the experiment, but did completely penetrate the cell during overnight exposure. The present study thus shows a clear dependence of D on protein inhibitor size when moving within intact skeletal muscle fibers. Low molecular weight protease inhibitors such as cystatin can be effectively diffused into intact fish muscle cells to minimize proteolytic activity and meat softening."
0,"The aim of this study was to examine changes in the lipid profile of red blood cells and muscle tissue along with the expression of anabolic signalling proteins in human skeletal muscle. Following a 2-week control period, 10 healthy male participants consumed 5 g d(-1) of fish oil (FO) for 4 weeks. Muscle biopsies and venous blood samples were collected in the fasted state 2 weeks prior (W-2) and immediately before (W0) the initiation of FO supplementation for internal control. Muscle biopsies and venous blood samples were again obtained at week 1 (W1), 2 (W2) and 4 (W4) during FO supplementation for assessment of changes in lipid composition and expression of anabolic signalling proteins. There was no change in the composition of any lipid class between W-2 and W0 confirming control. Following FO supplementation n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) muscle lipid composition was increased from W0 to W2 and continued to rise at W4. n-3 PUFA blood lipid composition was increased from W0 to W1 and remained elevated for the remaining time points. Total protein content of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) increased from W0 to W4 whereas total mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) was increased from W0 at W1 with no further significant increases at W2 and W4. These data show that FO supplementation results in discordant changes in the n-3 PUFA composition of skeletal muscle compared to blood that is associated with increases in total FAK content."
0,"Cholinesterases are frequent targets for toxic effects, namely by insecticides derived from phosphoric and carbamic acids. This effects allows the use of cholinesterase inhibition as a biomarker for contamination of aquatic environments by these specific chemical agents. However, cholinesterases are differently responsive to environmental contaminants, according to their different forms and locations. In addition, cholinesterases seem also to be inhibited by metals, so their use as an environmental criterion requires the prior characterization of their specific forms in each species and tissues, and the study of their sensitivity. The objective of this study was to characterize the cholinesterase isoenzymes present in the brain and dorsal muscle of three tropical fish species, namely Phalloceros harpagos (Lucinda, 2008), Pterygoplichthys pardalis (Castelnau, 1855) and Astyanax altiparanae (Garutti and Britski, 2000). In vitro assays were conducted to quantify the effect of pesticides (dimethoate and carbaryl) and metals (lead and copper) on cholinesterases activity. Although acetylcholinesterase seems to be the most prevalent and abundant form, as commonly described in vertebrates, the here-obtained results showed that three cholinesterase isoenzymes occur in tissues of the three fish species. In addition, the pesticide carbaryl caused a stronger inhibition than dimethoate. Copper caused a significantly higher cholinesterasic inhibition than lead, which is also in line with most results concerning the anticholinesterasic effects by these metals. The here obtained results allowed to conclude that acetylcholinesterase is the predominant form in all tissues from the three analyzed species. In addition, cholinesterases of these three fish were responsive to common environmental contaminants, namely metals and pesticides, similarly to what was already described for fish of temperate areas. This allows using the here proposed fish species in environmental studies for the assessment of the presence of neurotoxicants under neotropical conditions."
0,"HIF-l is the earliest documented and most widely studied hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and plays a key role in the cell hypoxia signal transduction pathway. Particularly, the HIF-1α protein is sensitive to oxygen and plays a critical role in hypoxia regulation. This study is the first to report on the molecular cloning and characterization of HIF-1α in bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis; anHIF-1α). The full-length cDNA of anHIF-1α was 2361 bp, and encodes an estimated 674 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 76.10 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 7.72. Moreover, the conserved basic Helix-Loop-Helix domain along with two Per-ARNT-Sim domains (A/B), and C-TAD were identified in this protein. Interestingly, the tertiary structure of the anHIF-1α protein was found to be extremely similar to that of mice. Multiple comparison and phylogenetic tree results demonstrated that anHIF-1α was highly conserved. Under normoxic conditions, anHIF-1α mRNA transcripts could be detected in all tissues examined with the highest expression level in the heart. With gradually decreasing oxygen concentrations, anHIF-1α mRNA level was upregulated significantly in the gill, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, brain, and muscle tissues (P < 0.05). Similarly, anHIF-1α was expressed in all examined bighead carp tissues, and the results suggested that the upregulation of anHIF-1α at the transcriptional level may be an important stress response adaptation to hypoxia in bighead carp. Finally, based on the tertiary structure comparative analyses between anHIF-1α with mouse HIF-1α, we think the physiological function, and protein structure of HIF-1α could be compared between fish and mammal in the future."
0,"In mammals, a matricellular protein, thrombospondin 2 (Thbs2) has been reported to play important roles in modulating cell-matrix interactions, vascular integrity and thrombosis formation. However, the role of gene, thbs2 has not yet been studied in teleost. In the present study, this novel fish gene from Japanese flounder was cloned and its function in resistant to lymphocystis disease virus was elucidated. The Japanese flounder thbs2 encoded a 1176-amino acid protein with 91% identity to medaka. Amino acid sequence indicated that Japanese flounder Thbs2 contained 10 typical conserved domains. The thbs2 was expressed in all stages of embryo development, and in hatched larva stage, its expression was significantly higher than that in other stages (P < 0.05). The relative expression level of thbs2 was significantly higher in the head kidney, liver, blood, gill, and heart of the lymphocystis disease virus resistant fish than in sensitive fish (P < 0.05); and in muscle, this difference was at highly significant (P < 0.01). Additionally, the distribution of Thbs2 in tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Subcellular localization analysis showed that Thbs2 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cells. Taken together, our results provide new basic data for thbs2 function, especially its role in anti-lymphocystis disease virus immune response."
0,"Tea polyphenols (TP) are known to be important for the post-mortem deterioration of fish muscle and can enhance food quality. To shed light on the influence of TP on the status of large yellow croaker muscle proteins, control and treated fillets (0.1% TP, 0.2% TP and 0.3% TP, w/v) were analysed periodically for myofibrillar protein functional properties (Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, surface hydrophobicity, total sulfhydryl content, emulsion stability index and rheological behaviour). Degradation of the myofibrillar protein myosin could be clearly observed; several proteins were also observed to vary in abundance following post-mortem storage for 25 days. The present study offers new evidence that TP have an effective impact on muscle protein integrity post-mortem."
0,"Omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA), particularly docosahexaenoic acids (22:6n-3, DHA), have positive effects on multiple biologic and pathologic processes. Fish are the major dietary source of n-3 LC-PUFA for humans. Growing evidence supports acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) synthetase 6 (<i>acsl6</i>) being involved in cellular DHA uptake and lipogenesis in mammals, while its molecular function and regulatory mechanism remain unknown in fish. The present study focused on investigating the molecular characterization and transcription regulation of the <i>acsl6</i> gene in the freshwater teleost common carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>). First, the full length of <i>acsl6</i> cDNA contained a coding region of 2148 bp for 715 amino acids, which possessed all characteristic features of the acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) family. Its mRNA expression was the highest in the brain, followed by in the heart, liver, kidney, muscle, and eyes, but little expression was detected in the ovary and gills. Additionally, a candidate <i>acsl6</i> promoter region of 2058 bp was cloned, and the sequence from -758 bp to -198 bp was determined as core a promoter by equal progressive deletion and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The binding sites for important transcription factors (TFs), including stimulatory protein 1 (SP1), CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα), sterol-regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), and PPARγ were identified in the core promoter by site-directed mutation and functional assays. Furthermore, the intraperitoneal injection of PPARγ agonists (balaglitazone) increased the expression of <i>acsl6</i> mRNA, coupling with an increased proportion of DHA in the muscle, while opposite results were obtained in the injection of the SREBP1c antagonist (betulin). However, the expression of <i>acsl6</i> and DHA content in muscle were largely unchanged by PPARα agonist (fenofibrate) treatment. These results indicated that <i>acsl6</i> may play an important role for the muscular DHA uptake and deposition in common carp, and PPARγ and SREBP-1c are the potential TFs involved in the transcriptional regulation of <i>acsl6</i> gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the characterization of <i>acsl6</i> gene and its promoter in teleosts."
0,"Tributyltin (TBT) is reported to induce adipogenesis in fish, which might affect nutritional qualities and health status. Muscle tissues account for the majority of body mass, and have been described as a major site of fat deposition and an immunologically active organ. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate whether chronic exposures of TBT, at environmental concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 ng/L, affects lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and immune status in muscle tissues of rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus). After 60 d of exposure, TBT increased contents of total lipid, total cholesterol, triglyceride and fatty acids in muscle tissues. Interestingly, TBT exposure disrupted fatty acid composition and increased contents of unsaturated fatty acids (such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) in muscle tissues, which might be a response to preserve membrane functions from TBT exposure. Meanwhile, the concentrations of hepatic fatty acid desaturase 2 (Δ6-desaturase) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Δ9-desaturase) were increased after TBT exposure, which might contribute the increase of unsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, TBT increased muscle lipid peroxidation products, antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase), and the expression of immune-related molecules (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta and nuclear factor kappa B) in muscle tissues. The disruption of TBT on the lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and immune-toxic effects in muscle tissues of fish might reduce nutritional qualities, and affect growth and health status, which might pose a constant and serious threat to fish and result in economic loss in aquaculture."
0,"We have shown that feeding cod protein, which is rich in anti-inflammatory arginine, glycine, and taurine, may beneficially modulate the inflammatory response during recovery following skeletal muscle injury; however it is unknown if these amino acids are responsible for this effect. This study was designed to assess whether supplementing casein with an amino acid mixture composed of arginine, glycine, taurine and lysine, matching their respective levels in cod protein, may account for the anti-inflammatory effect of cod protein. Male Wistar rats were fed isoenergetic diets containing either casein, cod protein, or casein supplemented with L-arginine (0.45%), glycine (0.43%), L-taurine (0.17%) and L-lysine (0.44%) (casein+). After 21 days of ad libitum feeding, one tibialis anterior muscle was injured with 200 µl bupivacaine while the saline-injected contra-lateral tibialis anterior was served as sham. Cod protein and casein+ similarly modulated the inflammation as they decreased COX-2 level at day 2 post-injury (cod protein, p=0.014; casein+, p=0.029) and ED1(+) macrophage density at days 2 (cod protein, p=0.012; casein+, p<0.0001), 5 (cod protein, p=0.001; casein+, p<0.0001) and 14 (cod protein, p<0.0001; casein+, p<0.0001) post-injury, and increased ED2(+) macrophage density at days 5 (cod protein, p<0.0001; casein+, p=0.006), 14 (cod protein, p=0.001; casein+, p<0.002) and 28 (cod protein, p<0.009; casein+, p<0.005) post-injury compared with casein. Furthermore, cod protein up-regulated (p=0.037) whereas casein+ tended to up-regulate (p=0.062) myogenin expression at day 5 post-injury compared with casein. In the cod protein-fed group, these changes resulted in greater muscle mass at days 14 (p=0.002), and 28 (p=0.001) post-injury and larger myofiber cross-sectional area at day 28 post-injury compared with casein (p=0.012). No such effects were observed with casein+. These data indicate that anti-inflammatory actions of cod protein, contrary to its effect on muscle mass recovery, are driven by its high levels of arginine, glycine, taurine and lysine."
0,"Parvalbumin (PA) is a classical EF-hand calcium-binding protein of muscle, neuronal, and other tissues, and a major fish allergen. Although certain apo-PAs lack tertiary structure, functional implications of that feature and its structural prerequisites remain unclear. In a search for unstable PAs, we probed conformational stability of parvalbumin β-1 from coho salmon (csPA), a cold water fish species, using circular dichroism, scanning calorimetry, hydrophobic probe fluorescence, limited proteolysis, chemical crosslinking and dynamic light scattering techniques. Apo-csPA is shown to be mainly monomeric protein with markedly disorganized secondary structure and lack of rigid tertiary structure. Examination of per-residue propensity for intrinsic disorder in the PA groups with either folded or unfolded apo-form using the average PONDR<sup>®</sup> VSL2P profiles revealed that the N-terminal region that includes α-helix A, AB-loop and N-terminal half of α-helix B is predicted to be less ordered in PAs with disordered apo-state. Application of the structural criteria developed for discrimination of disordered PAs indicate that the latter comprise about 16-19% of all PAs. We show that structural instability of apo-β-PA serves as a hallmark of elevated calcium affinity of the protein. Therefore, the successful predictions of unstable apo-PAs might facilitate search for PAs with maximal calcium affinity and possibly serving as calcium sensors."
0,"Thioredoxin is a highly conserved protein found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in response to metabolic processes, radiation, metal oxidation, and pathological infections. High levels of ROS lead to cell death via autophagy. However, thioredoxin acts as an active regulatory enzyme in response to excessive ROS. Here, we performed in-silico analysis, immune challenge experiments, and functional assays of seahorse thioredoxin-like protein 1 (ShTXNL1). Evolutionary identification showed that ShTXNL1 protein belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily comprising 289 amino acids. It possesses an N-terminal active thioredoxin domain and C-terminal proteasome-interacting thioredoxin domain (PITH) of ShTXNL1 which is a component of 26S proteasome and binds to the matrix or cell. Pairwise alignment results showed 99.0% identity and 99.7% similarity with the sequence of Hippocampus species. Conserved thiol-disulfide cysteine residue containing Cys-X-X-Cys motif may be found in the first few amino acids in the second beta sheet starting from the N-terminus. This motif can be discovered in ShTXNL1 as <sup>14</sup>CRPC<sup>17</sup> and comprised two N-linked glycosylation sites at <sup>72</sup>NISA<sup>75</sup> and <sup>139</sup>NESD<sup>142</sup>. According to the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis from healthy seahorses, highest ShTXNL1 mRNA expression was observed in muscle, followed by ovary, brain, gill, and blood tissues. Moreover, significant temporal expression of ShTXNL1 was observed in gill and blood tissues after bacterial stimuli. Thus, the ShTXNL1 gene may be identified as an immunologically important gene in seahorse."
0,"Observations from the present study provide the first characterization of the GH-IGF axis in Shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorhynchus, an ancestral fish species. An initial characterization of steady-state IGF-I and IGF-II gene expression in multiple tissues was conducted using real-time RT-qPCR. Overall, the tissues had significantly different profiles of IGF-I gene expression, with the highest IGF-I expression observed in the liver. The highest IGF-II gene expression was also observed in the liver, with minimal or no detection in muscle. A comparison between IGF-I and IGF-II expression within individual tissues revealed higher levels of IGF-II than IGF-I mRNA in the spleen, stomach and trunk kidney, and higher levels of relative IGF-I mRNA expression in the intestine and muscle. The GH-IGF axis was further elucidated by observing the effects of exogenous GH on IGF-I and IGF-II expression in liver and muscle tissue. The results revealed a significant dose-dependent response of both hepatic IGF-I and IGF-II, and muscle IGF-I mRNA expression following rbGH administration. At the highest rbGH concentration (240μg/g BW), IGF-I mRNA levels in liver and muscle peaked significantly at 48h, indicating both hepatic and muscle IGF-I expression to be stimulated by GH. Hepatic IGF-II expression was also stimulated 48h following rbGH administration. Expression of IGF-II mRNA was not inducible in the muscle. Few studies have evaluated the effects of exogenous GH on IGF expression in ancestral vertebrate species, and as such, this research provides valuable insight into the evolution of the somatotropic axis in vertebrates."
0,"Myogenic regulatory factor 4 (MRF4) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays crucial roles in myoblast differentiation and maturation. Here, we report the isolation of the olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) mrf4 gene and the spatiotemporal analysis of its expression patterns. Sequence analysis indicated that flounder mrf4 shared a similar structure with other vertebrate MRF4, including the conserved bHLH domain. Flounder mrf4 contains 3 exons and 2 introns. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that it was highly homologous with Salmo salar, Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes, and Tetraodon nigroviridis mrf4. Flounder mrf4 was first expressed in the medial region of somites that give rise to slow muscles, and later spread to the lateral region of somites that give rise to fast muscles. Mrf4 transcript levels decreased significantly in mature somites in the trunk region, and expression could only be detected in the caudal somites, consistent with the timing of somite maturation. Transient expression analysis showed that the 506 bp flounder mrf4 promoter was sufficient to direct muscle-specific GFP expression in zebrafish embryos."
0,"Ideal nutritional conditions are crucial to sustainable aquaculture due to economic and environmental issues. Here we apply stable isotope analysis as an indicator of fish growth and feeding balance, to define the optimum diet for efficient growing conditions. Juveniles of gilthead sea bream were fed with six isoenergetic diets differing in protein to lipid proportion (from 41/26 to 57/20). As protein intake increased, δ¹⁵N and Δδ¹⁵N of muscle and Δδ¹⁵N and Δδ¹³C of its protein fraction decreased, indicating lower protein turnover and higher protein deposition in muscle. This is reflected in the inverse relationship found between Δδ¹⁵N and growth rate, although no differences were observed in either parameter beyond the protein/lipid proportion 47/23. Principal component analysis (PCA) also signaled 47/23 diet as the pivotal point with the highest growing efficiency, with isotopic parameters having the highest discrimination load. Thus, muscle isotope composition, especially ¹⁵N, can be used to evaluate nutritional status in farmed fish."

Therefore, the authors evaluate the effects of a fish-oil diet administered to a long-term, during pre-mating, gestation, and lactation, in reducing cancer-cachexia damages in adult Walker-256 tumor-bearing offspring."
1,"Female rats receive control or fish oil diet during pre-mating, gestation, and lactation. After weaning, male offspring are fed the control diet until adulthood and distributed in (C) control adult-offspring; (W) adult tumor-bearing offspring; (OC) adult-offspring of maternal fish oil diet; (WOC) adult tumor-bearing offspring of maternal fish oil diet groups. Fat body mass is preserved, muscle expression of mechanistic target of rapamicin (mTOR) and eukariotic binding protein of eukariotic factor 4E (4E-BP1) is modified, being associated with lower 20S proteasome protein expression, and the liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme content maintained in the WOC group. Also, the OC group shows reduced triglyceridemia."
2,"In this experimental model of cachexia, the long-term maternal supplementation is a positive strategy to improve liver function and lipid metabolism, as well as to modify muscle proteins expression in the mTOR pathway and also reduce the 20S muscle proteasome protein, without altering the tumor development and muscle wasting in adult tumor-bearing offspring."

This study's aim was to investigate the ideal dietary α-linolenic acid (ALA): linoleic acid (LA) ratio for maximizing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) synthesis and their deposition in the muscle of silver barb, as that of fish oil based control diet."
1,"Fish (with an initial body weight of 11.07 ± 0.12 g) were fed for 60 days with five experimental iso-proteinous, iso-lipidic, and iso-caloric diets, supplemented with linseed oil and peanut oil at varying levels to obtain ALA:LA ratios of 0.35, 0.51, 0.91, 2.04, 2.66. A control diet was prepared by supplementing fish oil. The dietary ALA:LA ratio did not influence the growth performance of fish. With increased dietary ALA:LA ratios, LA content decreased and ALA content increased in the muscle and liver of silver barb. The n-3 LC-PUFA level in muscle and liver was not influenced by feeding different ratios of ALA:LA, whereas n-6 LC-PUFA was decreased in the muscle and increased in the liver with increased dietary ALA:LA ratios. Increasing dietary ALA:LA ratio increased the Δ6fad and elovl5mRNA expression in the liver, muscle, brain, and intestinal tissues of silver barbs."
2,Silver barb possess the ability to elongate and desaturate ALA and LA to their end products EPA and DHA. The highest level expression of Δ6 fad and elovl5 mRNA at the dietary ALA:LA ratio of 2.66 suggests greater affinity of these enzymes towards ALA than LA in silver barb. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.
0,"Antioxidant properties and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of protein hydrolysates from goby (Zosterisessor ophiocephalus) muscle, with different degrees of hydrolysis (DH) from 5 to 25%, prepared by treatment with crude proteases extract from smooth hound intestines, were investigated. Goby protein hydrolysates (GPHs) are rich in Gly and Thr, which accounted for 14.1-15% and 11.6-13.2% of the total amino acids, respectively. The antioxidant activities of GPHs were investigated by using several in vitro assay systems. All GPHs exhibited significant metal chelating activity and DPPH free radical-scavenging activity, and inhibited linoleic acid peroxidation. For the ACE-inhibitory activity, as the DH increased, the activity of GPHs increased. The obtained results revealed that antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities of GPHs were influenced by the degree of hydrolysis. A medium degree of enzymatic hydrolysis was appropriate to obtain GPHs with good antioxidant activity, while small peptides were essential to obtain high ACE inhibitory activity."
0,"Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), a major intracellular protein capable of transferring neutral lipids, plays a pivotal role in the assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. In this study, MTTP cDNA was firstly cloned from the liver of blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala), the full-length cDNA covered 3457-bp with an open reading frame of 2661-bp, which encodes 886 amino acids, including a putative signal peptide of 24 amino acids long. After the feeding trial, a graded tissue-specific expression pattern of MTTP was observed and high expression abundance in the liver and intestine indicated its major function in lipid transport in this fish species. In addition, expression of genes encoding MTTP as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which are transcription factors and serve as key regulators in lipid homoeostasis, was all affected by dietary lipid and choline supplementations. Elevated dietary lipid levels significantly increased the liver, intestinal and muscle MTTP mRNA abundance. Additionally, the down-regulation of MTTP expression in the liver and muscle was observed when fish were fed with inadequate choline supplementation in high-fat diet, yet up-regulated as supplementing extra choline in diet. Expressions of PPARα and PPARβ in the liver and muscle showed similar trend of MTTP expression. The results suggested the potential connection of MTTP and PPAR in response to different dietary nutritional factors. Furthermore, extra choline supplementations could promote lipid transfer and enhance fatty acid oxidation, which indicated a molecular mechanism of choline on diminishing fat accumulation in blunt snout bream.

0,"Quantitative expression analysis of goldfish SAA revealed the highest mRNA levels in the kidney, spleen and intestine with lower mRNA levels in muscle and liver. Goldfish SAA was differentially expressed in goldfish immune cells with highest mRNA levels observed in neutrophils. To functionally assess goldfish SAA, recombinant protein (rgSAA) was generated by prokaryotic expression and functionally characterized. Monocytes and macrophages treated with rgSAA exhibited differential gene expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. rgSAA induced gene expression of both pro-inflammatory (TNFα1, TNFα2) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGFβ) in monocytes. rgSAA induced IL-1β1 and SAA gene expression in macrophages. rgSAA was chemotactic to macrophages and neutrophils, but not monocytes. rgSAA did not affect respiratory burst induced by heat-killed Aeromonas salmonicida. rgSAA treatment of macrophages down-regulated their production of nitric oxide. rgSAA exhibited antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli in a concentration dependent manner."
0,"The mammalian response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is mainly mediated by Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4). Fish and mammalian TLR4 vary; fish TLR4 ligands are unknown. Isolation of fish tlr4 genes is difficult due to their complex genomic structure. Three bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing grass carp tlr4 were obtained. Four tlr4 genes, with a varied genomic structure and different protein domains were subsequently isolated by constructing a subcloned library and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The four tlr4 genes were expressed during development from 12h post-fertilization, in all healthy adult fish tissues tested, and significantly increased in grass carp reovirus (GCRV)-infected liver and muscle, suggesting the tlr4 genes play a role in GCRV infection. This study effectively separated each gene in the tlr4 gene cluster, implies that grass carp TLR4 proteins have different ligand recognition specificities to mammalian TLRs, and provides information on the functional evolution of TLRs."
0,"This study evaluated the effects of trophic and subchronic exposure to inorganic mercury (Hg) on the oxidative stress biomarkers and its bioaccumulation potential in the liver, gills, white muscle and heart of the freshwater top predator fish, Hoplias malabaricus, fed with contaminated live juveniles of matrinxã, Brycon amazonicus, as prey vehicle. Inorganic mercury increased superoxide dismutase, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione reductase (GR) activities in the liver, white muscle and heart. Gills CAT activity remained unchanged while GPx and GR values showed a significant decrease. In the liver and gills, Hg induced significant increase in the reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione content, concomitantly with a significant decrease in [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio. Differently, in cardiac tissue, the Hg caused an increase in GSH level and increase in [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio. Lipid and protein oxidation and metallothionein levels were significantly higher after Hg trophic exposure in the liver, gills and heart, but remained at control values in the white muscle. Tissue-specific responses against oxidative stress were observed, and the liver and gills were the most sensitive organs, showing signs of redox homeostasis failure. At the end of the experiment, dietary inorganic mercury accumulated through food chain levels. In order, Hg bioaccumulation was: gills > liver >> white muscle = heart. These results pointed out the potential of inorganic Hg to bioaccumulate in aquatic systems. Taken together, our findings suggest that Hg, even in the inorganic form and sublethal amounts, is a risk factor for aquatic biota."
0,"We have considered a novel gene targeting approach for treating pathologies and conditions whose genetic bases are defined using diet and nutrition. One such condition is Down syndrome, which is linked to overexpression of RCAN1 on human chromosome 21 for some phenotypes. We hypothesize that a decrease in RCAN1 expression with dietary supplements in individuals with Down syndrome represents a potential treatment. Toward this, we used in vivo studies and bioinformatic analysis to identify potential healthy dietary RCAN1 expression modulators. We observed Rcan1 isoform 1 (Rcan1-1) protein reduction in mice pup hippocampus after a 4-week curcumin and fish oil supplementation, with only fish oil reduction being statistically significant. Focusing on fish oil, we observed a 17% Rcan1-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and 19% Rcan1-1 protein reduction in BALB/c mice after 5 weeks of fish oil supplementation. Fish oil supplementation starting at conception and in a different mouse strain (C57BL) led to a 27% reduction in hippocampal Rcan1-1 mRNA and a 34% reduction in spleen Rcan1-1 mRNA at 6 weeks of age. Hippocampal protein results revealed a modest 11% reduction in RCAN1-1, suggesting translational compensation. Bioinformatic mining of human fish oil studies also revealed reduced RCAN1 mRNA expression, consistent with the above studies. These results suggest the potential use of fish oil in treating Down syndrome and support our strategy of using select healthy dietary agents to treat genetically defined pathologies, an approach that we believe is simple, healthy, and cost-effective.

0,"Fish skeletal muscle is comprised of fast muscle (FM) and slow muscle (SM), which constitutes 60% of total the body mass. Fish skeletal muscle can affect fish swimming activity, which is important for aquaculture due to its growth-potentiating effects. DNA methylation can influence gene expression level. We previously identified multiple differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between FM and SM in Takifugu rubripes. However, it is unknown if the expression levels of these DEGs are influenced by DNA methylation. In the present study, we used DNA methylation sequencing to study the DNA methylation profiles of FM and SM in T. rubripes. SM had higher overall methylation levels than FM. A total of 8479 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and 3407 DMGs containing differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the promoter regions between FM and SM were identified. After enrichment analysis, we found functionally relevant DMGs between FM and SM, including Kapca, Plcd3a, Plcd1, Pi3k, Tsp4b and Pgfrb in the hedgehog signaling pathway and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-related pathways. Due to the different methylation levels of these genes between FM and SM, the expression levels of Kapca, Plcd3a, Plcd1, Pi3k, and Tsp4b were higher in FM and Pgfrb was higher in SM. There were differences in the hedgehog signaling pathway and PI-related pathways between FM and SM. In SM, the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction promoted focal adhesion, while ECM-receptor interactions promoted focal adhesion in FM. These results provide information regarding the difference between FM and SM in T. rubripes."
0,"The Rio Doce estuary, in Brazil, was impacted by the deposition of iron mine tailings, caused by the collapse of a dam in 2015. Based on published baseline datasets, the estuary has been experiencing chronic trace metal contamination effects since 2017, with potential bioaccumulation in fishes and human health risks. As metal and metalloid concentrations in aquatic ecosystems pose severe threats to the aquatic biota, we hypothesized that the trace metals in estuarine sediments nearly two years after the disaster would lead to bioaccumulation in demersal fishes and result in the biosynthesis of metal-responsive proteins."
1,"We measured As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Se and Zn concentrations in sediment samples in August 2017 and compared to published baseline levels. Also, trace metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb, Se and Zn) and protein (metallothionein and reduced glutathione) concentrations were quantified in the liver and muscle tissues of five fish species (<i>Cathorops spixii</i>, <i>Genidens genidens</i>, <i>Eugerres brasilianus</i>, <i>Diapterus rhombeus</i> and <i>Mugil</i> sp.) from the estuary, commonly used as food sources by local populations."
2,"Our results revealed high trace metal concentrations in estuarine sediments, when compared to published baseline values for the same estuary. The demersal fish species <i>C. spixii</i> and <i>G. genidens</i> had the highest concentrations of As, Cr, Mn, Hg, and Se in both, hepatic and muscle, tissues. Trace metal bioaccumulation in fish was correlated with the biosynthesis of metallothionein and reduced glutathione in both, liver and muscle, tissues, suggesting active physiological responses to contamination sources. The trace metal concentrations determined in fish tissues were also present in the estuarine sediments at the time of this study. Some elements had concentrations above the maximum permissible limits for human consumption in fish muscles (e.g., As, Cr, Mn, Se and Zn), suggesting potential human health risks that require further studies. Our study supports the high biogeochemical mobility of toxic elements between sediments and the bottom-dwelling biota in estuarine ecosystems."
0,"Most teleost fish are known to require high levels of dietary proteins. Such high-protein intake could have significant effects, particularly on insulin-regulated gene expression. We therefore analyzed the effects of an increase in the ratio of dietary carbohydrates/proteins on the refeeding activation of the Akt-target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathways in rainbow trout and the effects on the expression of several genes related to hepatic and muscle metabolism and known to be regulated by insulin, amino acids, and/or glucose. Fish were fed once one of three experimental diets containing high (H), medium (M), or low (L) protein (P) or carbohydrate (C) levels after 48 h of feed deprivation. Activation of the Akt/TOR signaling pathway by refeeding was severely impaired by decreasing the proteins-to-carbohydrates ratio. Similarly, postprandial regulation of several genes related to glucose (Glut4, glucose-6-phosphatase isoform 1), lipid (fatty acid synthase, ATP-citrate lyase, sterol responsive element binding protein, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase), and amino acid metabolism (serine dehydratase and branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase E2 subunit) only occurred when fish were fed the high-protein diet. On the other hand, diet composition had a low impact on the expression of genes related to muscle protein degradation. Interestingly, glucokinase was the only gene of those monitored whose expression was significantly upregulated by increased carbohydrate intake. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that macro-nutrient composition of the diet strongly affected the insulin/amino acids signaling pathway and expression pattern of genes related to metabolism."
0,"This work was focused on the study of the bioactive potential of three fish protein hydrolysates, one of them prepared from industrial sardine by-products (head and viscera) and the others from tuna by-products (head, and muscle and viscera). These protein hydrolysates exhibited moderate ability to inhibit Angiotensin Converting Enzyme or ACE (IC50 between 0.24-1.16 mg dry weight per ml) and prolyl oligopeptidase or PO (IC50 between 3.30-9.57 mg ml(-1)), those obtained from tuna by-products being the most effective. Overall, ACE- and PO-inhibiting activities were enhanced by sequential nanofiltration through 3 and 1 kDa MWCO membranes (IC50 between 0.02-0.16 mg ml(-1) (ACE) and 1.10-4.21 mg ml(-1) (PO)). The inhibitory properties of the hydrolysates were greatly improved by in vitro gastric digestion, and were barely affected by further intestinal digestion. The digested tuna hydrolysates, mainly that from heads, proved to be the best source of PO- and ACE- inhibiting molecules (IC50 = 0.16 mg ml(-1) (ACE) and 1.04 mg ml(-1) (PO)) and could be potential new ingredients in food with interest in the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular and neurological diseases.

0,"Peptidoglycan recognition proteins are members of the family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), that play important roles in the recognition of peptidoglycan and various biological processes. In this study, we have characterized peptidoglycan recognition protein-SC2 (PGRP-SC2) in rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) (RbPGRP-SC2) and analysed its expression in various tissues after pathogen challenge. A sequence alignment revealed that the residues essential to zinc binding of the deduced protein were highly conserved among all the organisms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RbPGRP-SC2 is most closely related to the large yellow croaker PGRP-SC2. RbPGRP-SC2 was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues analysed, predominantly distributed in muscle and skin. After challenge with microbial pathogens (Edwardsiella piscicida), Streptococcus iniae or red seabream iridovirus [RSIV]), RbPGRP-SC2 was up-regulated in all the tissues examined, especially in liver. We produced recombinant RbPGRP-SC2 (rRbPGRP-SC2) using an Escherichia coli expression system. The rRbPGRP-SC2 had agglutination activity towards both Gram-negative (E. piscicida) and Gram-positive bacteria (S. iniae). In addition, rRbPGRP-SC2 induced leukocyte apoptosis and promoted leukocyte phagocytosis. These results suggest that the RbPGRP-SC2 plays an important role in the immune system and in maintaining cellular homeostasis of rock bream."
0,"Growth, skeletal structure and muscle composition of cold-shock-induced triploid olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus were investigated. The average values of total length and total weight of triploids were higher than those of diploids from 5 to 11 months posthatch (mph). The growth difference disappeared after 11 mph. The skeletal structure of flounder at 11 mph was observed by X-ray imaging method. There are four kinds of vertebral deformity including vertebrae fusion, one-sided compression, two-sided compression and vertically shifted. The trunk region (V8-18) and tailing end of the vertebral column were the predominant locations of deformity. In general, the frequencies of vertebral deformities in triploids (60.0%) were higher than those in diploids (33.3%, p < 0.05). Both the number of fish with deformed vertebrae and the average frequencies of deformed vertebrae in triploids were significantly higher than those in diploids (p < 0.05). The muscle tissues of diploid and triploid flounder at 11 mph contain the same types of fatty acid and free amino acid profiles. The number of fatty acids with significant higher contents in diploids and triploids was one and ten, respectively (p < 0.05). The contents of free amino acids showed no difference between triploid and diploid fish."
0,"The present study was designed to determine whether changes in dietary protein source are related to changes in antioxidant status determined by enzyme activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), gluthatione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and gluthatione reductase (GSSG-Red) and lipid peroxidation levels in various tissues. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR; 5 wk old) were fed diets containing 20% casein or fish protein for 2 mo. Feeding the fish protein diet lowered blood pressure and reduced plasma total cholesterol levels and SOD activity in all tissues except muscle compared with the casein diet. Feeding fish protein also enhanced GSH level and GSH-Px activity in liver and heart, accompanied by lower lipid peroxidation. In kidney, however, the lower catalase activity in rats fed fish protein was associated with an enhancement in lipid peroxidation. Plasma and VLDL + LDL lipid peroxidation was unaffected by dietary proteins. In conclusion, the fish protein diet did not play a relevant role in plasma antioxidative defense status but increased it in liver and heart compared with the casein diet. Fish protein attenuated the development of hypertension and also decreased plasma total cholesterol concentration. Thus, it enhances protection against cardiovascular diseases."
0,"Here, we analyzed the fast-twitch muscle of juvenile Piaractus mesopotamicus (pacu) submitted to prolonged fasting (30d) and refeeding (6h, 24h, 48h and 30d). We measured the relative rate of weight and length increase (RRIlength and RRIweight), performed shotgun proteomic analysis and did Western blotting for PVALB after 30d of fasting and 30d of refeeding. We assessed the gene expression of igf-1, mafbx and pvalb after 30d of fasting and after 6h, 24h, 48h and 30d of refeeding. We performed a bioinformatic analysis to predict miRNAs that possibly control parvalbumin expression. After fasting, RRIlength, RRIweight and igf-1 expression decreased, while the mafbx expression increased, which suggest that prolonged fasting caused muscle atrophy. After 6h and 24h of refeeding, mafbx was not changed and igf-1 was downregulated, while after 48h of refeeding mafbx was downregulated and igf-1 was not changed. After 30d of refeeding, RRIlength and RRIweight were increased and igf-1 and mafbx expression were not changed. Proteomic analysis identified 99 proteins after 30d of fasting and 71 proteins after 30d of refeeding, of which 23 and 17, respectively, were differentially expressed. Most of these differentially expressed proteins were related to cytoskeleton, muscle contraction, and metabolism. Among these, parvalbumin (PVALB) was selected for further validation. The analysis showed that pvalb mRNA was downregulated after 6h and 24h of refeeding, but was not changed after 30d of fasting or 48h and 30d of refeeding. The Western blotting confirmed that PVALB protein was downregulated after 30d of fasting and 30d of refeeding. The downregulation of the protein and the unchanged expression of the mRNA after 30d of fasting and 30d of refeeding suggest a post-transcriptional regulation of PVALB. Our miRNA analysis predicted 444 unique miRNAs that may target pvalb. In conclusion, muscle atrophy and partial compensatory growth caused by prolonged fasting followed by refeeding affected the muscle proteome and PVALB expression."
0,"The effect of dietary nutrients on novel farm species has always garnered wide research and economic interest. Chinese perch, an economically important carnivorous fish, accepts an artificial diet after taming, so it is essential to evaluate and optimize the nutritional and metabolic demands of this species. However, little is known about the effect of an artificial diet on the growth and metabolism of Chinese perch. Therefore, the present study evaluated the growth and metabolic responses of Chinese perch to experimental diets with different dietary protein/energy (P/E) ratios. Five isoenergetic diets (18 kJ/g) with graded levels of P/E ratios of 30.58, 33.22, 35.90, 38.6, and 41.35 mg/kJ (named A, B, C, D, and E) were formulated. A total of 225 Chinese perch (64.89 ± 0.28 g) were divided into five groups (triplicate tanks for each group), distributed into 15 (350 L) fiberglass tanks, and fed twice a day at 4% of fish wet body weight with the respective P/E ratio diets for 10 weeks. Compared with the other groups, Chinese perch in Group C showed significantly improved growth performance, weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), viscerosomatic index (VSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI), intraperitoneal fat (IPF), feed utilization, feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), protein retention efficiency (PRE), energy retention efficiency (ERE), and feed efficiency (FE) as well as whole-body, muscle, and liver composition. Chinese perch in Group A, on the other hand, had the lowest growth performance, feed utilization, and body composition compared with the other groups. The activities of nitrogen metabolism-related enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), and adenosine 5'-monophosphate deaminase (AMPD)) as well as the mRNA expression of the <i>GDH</i> and <i>AMPD</i> genes were significantly lower than those in the other groups. Similarly, the expression of <i>NPY</i> and <i>AgRp</i> were significantly higher in Group C compared with the other groups. However, the gene expression of <i>CART</i> and <i>POMC</i> was not affected by the dietary P/E ratios. In Group A, the expression of <i>mTOR</i>, <i>S6K</i>, and <i>4EBP1</i> was significantly lower and that of <i>AMPK</i>, <i>LKB1</i>, and <i>eEF2</i> was significantly higher when compared with the other groups. Biochemical analysis of blood showed that ALT, AST, total protein (TP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glucose (GLU), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and triglyceride (TG) levels were also affected by the dietary P/E ratio. From our results, we concluded that Chinese perch growth performance and nutrient metabolism were significantly affected by the P/E ratio of the artificial diet. Second-order polynomial regression analysis revealed that Chinese perch growth performance was optimal at a P/E ratio of 37.98 in the artificial diet."
0,"Intermuscular bones (IBs) are only found in the muscles of fish. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (bmp2) is considered to be the most active single osteogenesis factor. It promotes cell proliferation and differentiation during bone repair, as well as inducing the formation of bones and cartilages in vivo. However, detailed investigations of this family in fish are incredibly limited. Here, we have used a variety of published and unpublished <i>bmp2</i> sequences for teleosts and cartilage fish in order to explore and expand our understanding of <i>bmp2</i> genes in fish. Our results confirmed that teleost genomes contain two or more <i>bmp2</i> genes, and the diversity of <i>bmp2</i> genes in vertebrates appears to be as a result of a combination of whole genome duplication (WGD) and gene loss. Differences were also observed in tissue distribution and relative transcription abundance of the <i>bmp2s</i> through a transcriptomic analysis. Our data also indicated that <i>bmp2b</i> may play an important role in the formation of IBs in teleosts. In addition, protein sequence alignments and 3D structural predictions of <i>bmp2a</i> and <i>bmp2b</i> supported their similar roles in fishes. To summarize, our existing work provided novel insights into the <i>bmp2</i> family genes in fishes through a mixture of comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis."
0,"Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) belongs to RIG-I like receptor (RLR) family, which detects cytosolic viral RNA component in immune response. In this study, MDA5 orthologue of black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) has been cloned and characterized. The full-length cDNA of black carp MDA5 (bcMDA5) comprises 3244 nucleotides and the predicted bcMDA5 protein contains 984 amino acids. The constitutive transcription of bcMDA5 was extremely low in all the tested tissues, which included gill, skin, muscle, intestine, kidney, spleen, liver and heart. However, bcMDA5 mRNA level was much enhanced in most selected tissues in response to GCRV or SVCV infection. bcMDA5 migrated around 120 KDa in immunoblot and was identified as a cytosolic protein by immunofluorescent staining in both EPC and HeLa cells. Expressing bcMDA5 in EPC cells resulted in the induction of promoter activity of zebrafish IFN3 or fathead minnow IFN. The EPC cells expressing bcMDA5 obtained improved antiviral ability against both SVCV and GCRV. When EPC cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing bcMDA5 and bcLGP2, the induced IFN expression by bcMDA5 was obviously enhanced. EPC cells expressing both bcMDA5 and bcLGP2 owned much improved antiviral ability than those cells expressing only bcMDA5 or bcLGP2. In general, our data support the conclusion that bcMDA5 plays an important role in the antiviral innate immune response of black carp and bcLGP2 acts as a positive regulator in bcMDA5 mediated signaling."
0,"Protein profile of the skeletal muscle of Takifugu rubripes, a kind of pufferfish, was carried out with two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Among the 112 protein spots detected in a silver-stained 2-D polyacrylamide gel, 33 were analyzed by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF MS), and 21 were identified by MASCOT. There were six structural proteins, such as alpha-actin, tropomyosin, and myosin heavy chain, and six with known functions such as T-cell receptor alpha chain, 4SNc-Tudor domain protein, SMC3 protein, and Translin associated factor X, as well as nine hypothetical novel proteins, including titin, andretinol dehydrogenase, and apolipoprotein A-I binding protein. These proteins were further categorized into six functional groups. This paper established a suitable technical protocol to eliminate the high abundance proteins while preserving middle abundance proteins for proteomics studies using Takifugu skeletal muscle. It is also favorable for further investigation on screening marker proteins for monitoring and controlling the quality of fish meat."
0,"Insulin receptors have been demonstrated to be involved in embryogenesis, food intake regulation and glucose metabolism in several fish, while more researchis needed for further understanding. In this study, the complete coding sequence (CDS) of insulin receptor a (insra) gene and insulin receptor b (insrb) gene in grass carp were obtained, the CDS were 4068 bp and 4514 bp in length, encoding 1355 aa protein and 1351 aa protein. Both of insra and insrb in grass carp showed high amino acid identities with other fish. Insra and insrb genes were widely expressed in all tested tissues with an overlapping but distinct expressions. The high levels of insra mRNA were distributed in hindgut and heart tissues. The insrb gene showed the highest expression levels in liver and hindgut. We also proved that two forms of grass carp insulin receptors participate in the regulation of blood glucose and might act differently. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that different isoforms of fish insulin receptors are derived from two distinct genes, which was inconsistent with the generation of mammalian insulin receptors. Synteny analyses of insulin receptor genes showed that genes surrounding the insulin receptor genes were conserved in fish. Arhgef18, PEX11G, humanC19orf45 genes were highly conserved among mammal species. However, no conserved synteny was observed among fish, mammals, avians and amphibians. "
0,"The interaction between some proteins and immune globulin has been confirmed as an important source of matrix interference with the immunoassay of fishery products, but detailed biochemical properties of these proteins have not been indicated. Two interference-inducing proteins (42 and 36 kD) in flounder were isolated, characterized, and identified. Their influences on the immunoassay of norfloxacin were confirmed by western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The pI value and pH stability of the two proteins were also investigated. Using LC-MS/MS, the two proteins were identified as fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, and such results were partly verified by the aldolase activity of the 42 and 36 kD isolates. Considering the prevalence of these proteins (as multi-functional aldolase of muscles) in foods, these results would help to further understand the matrix effects in various immunoassays as well as the development of effective techniques to improve the efficiency of immunoassays."
0,"Neuregulin receptor degradation protein-1 (Nrdp1) was recently identified in humans as an important immune factor responding to the challenge of virus, LPS or cytokine. Its role in fish immune defense and whether it is involved in anti-parasite immunity have not been proven yet. In this report, the full-length cDNA sequence and genomic structure of Nrdp1 in the large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea (LcNrdp1) were identified and characterized. The full-length cDNA of LcNrdp1 was 1248bp, including a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 32bp, a 3' UTR of 259bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 937bp, encoding a polypeptide of 318 amino acid residues. The full-length genomic DNA sequence of LcNrdp1 was composed of 2635 nucleotides, including four exons and three introns. The putative LcNrdp1 protein had no signal peptide sequence and contained a characteristic Nrdp1 consensus motif C3HC3D ring finger and a Coiled-coil domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Nrdp1 in fish was closer with that in other vertebrates (79%-90% amino acid identity) than in invertebrates and bacteria (27%-65%). In fishes, Nrdp1 in large yellow croaker was closer with that in Takifugu rubripes. The expression profile showed that LcNrdp1 was constitutively expressed in all tested tissues, especially highly expressed in brain, muscle and kidney. Post-infection (PI) with Cryptocaryon irritans, an increased expression of LcNrdp1 was induced in infection sites (skin and gill), whereas in immune organs, the expression of LcNrdp1 was up-regulated in spleen (except the 1st d and 10th d PI) but suppressed in head kidney. These results suggested that LcNrdp1 might play an important immune role in the finfish L. crocea in the defense against the parasite C. irritans. "
0,"Softening is always a problem in fish preservation. This study was aimed to investigate the role of myofibrillar structural proteins degradation in fish softening. The changes of myofibrillar structural proteins, muscle ultrastructure, myofibril fragmentation, and shear force were studied. The results indicated that during the superchilled preservation of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), small (low-molecular-weight) myofibrillar structural proteins like desmin and troponin-T initiated textural deterioration, leading to Z-disk weakening and actin loosening. In contrast, giant (high-molecular-weight) myofibrillar structural proteins like titin and nebulin were degraded in more amount in the later storage, contributing to Z-disk and M-band disassembly and vague of light and dark regions (I and A bands). Compared to each other, desmin and titin played more important part in softening. All these changes were involved in the increase of muscle fibril segments and the sharp decrease of shear force."
0,"Muscle food characteristics (fatty acid profile, heme-Fe, intrinsic antioxidants) that relate to the formation of (patho)physiological oxidation products during gastrointestinal digestion are investigated."
1,"Muscles (n = 33) from 18 mammal, poultry, and fish species, of which some are mixed with lard to standardize their fatty acid profile, are digested in vitro. Lipid oxidation is assessed by thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), n-3 PUFA derivative 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal and propanal, n-6 PUFA derivative 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and hexanal, and protein oxidation by carbonylation. Digests of n-3 PUFA-rich fish demonstrated the highest n-3 PUFA oxidation, whereas digests of various poultry and rabbit muscles showed highest n-6 PUFA oxidation, which correlated significantly with the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio. Without lard addition, lipid oxidation is significantly higher in chicken and pork loin digests versus beef and deer digests, whereas the opposite occurred when these muscles are mixed with lard. Protein carbonylation correlates significantly with levels of TBARS and the sum of hydroxy-alkenals in digests. The n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio correlates well with the 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal/4-hydroxy-2-hexenal ratio in digests."

0,"The Amazonian cichlid <i>Astronotus ocellatus</i> is highly tolerant to hypoxia, and is known to reduce its metabolic rate by reducing the activity of energetically expensive metabolic processes when oxygen is lacking in its environment. Our objectives were to determine how protein metabolism is regulated in <i>A. ocellatus</i> during hypoxia. Fish were exposed to a stepwise decrease in air saturation (100%, 20%, 10% and 5%) for 2 h at each level, and sampled throughout the experiment. A flooding dose technique using a stable isotope allowed us to observe an overall decrease in protein synthesis during hypoxia in liver, muscle, gill and heart. We estimate that this decrease in rates of protein synthesis accounts for a 20 to 36% decrease in metabolic rate, which would enable oscars to maintain stable levels of ATP and prolong survival. It was also determined for the first time in fish that a decrease in protein synthesis during hypoxia is likely controlled by signaling molecules (4EBP1 and eIF2-α), and not simply due to a lack of ATP. We could not detect any effects of hypoxia on protein degradation as the levels of NH<sub>4</sub> excretion, indicators of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, and enzymatic activities of lysosomal and non-lysosomal proteolytic enzymes were maintained throughout the experiment."
0,"Aging associates with progressive loss of skeletal muscle function, sometimes leading to sarcopenia, a process characterized by impaired mobility and weakening of muscle strength. Since aging associates with profound epigenetic changes, epigenetic landscape alteration analysis in the skeletal muscle promises to highlight molecular mechanisms of age-associated alteration in skeletal muscle. This study was conducted exploiting the short-lived turquoise killifish <i>Nothobranchius furzeri</i> (<i>Nfu</i>), a relatively new model for aging studies. The epigenetic analysis suggested a less accessible and more condensed chromatin in old <i>Nfu</i> skeletal muscle. Specifically, an accumulation of heterochromatin regions was observed as a consequence of increased levels of H3K27me3, HP1α, polycomb complex subunits, and senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs). Consistently, euchromatin histone marks, including H3K9ac, were significantly reduced. In this context, integrated bioinformatics analysis of RNASeq and ChIPSeq, related to skeletal muscle of <i>Nfu</i> at different ages, revealed a down-modulation of genes involved in cell cycle, differentiation, and DNA repair and an up-regulation of inflammation and senescence genes. Undoubtedly, more studies are needed to disclose the detailed mechanisms; however, our approach enlightened unprecedented features of <i>Nfu</i> skeletal muscle aging, potentially associated with swimming impairment and reduced mobility typical of old <i>Nfu</i>."
0,"Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1) is a transmembrane protein belonging to the scavenger receptors (SRs) family and it plays an important role in viral entry. Not much is known on SRB1 in teleost fish. Grass carp reovirus (GCRV) cause huge economic losses in grass carp industry. In this study, rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) was used as a model fish to investigate the mechanism of GCRV infection, which is sensitive to GCRV. The structure of SRB1 gene in G. rarus (GrSRB1) was cloned and elucidated. GrSRB1 is composed of 13 exons and 12 introns, and its full-length cDNA is 2296 bp in length, with 1521 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a 506 amino acid protein. The GrSRB1 protein is predicted to contain a typical CD36 domain and two transmembrane regions. In G. rarus, GrSRB1 is expressed strongly in the liver (L), intestines (I), brain (B) and muscle (M), while it is expressed poorly in the heart (H), middle kidney (MK), head kidney (HK) and gills (G). After infection with GCRV, GrSRB1 expression was up-regulated in main immune tissues during the early infection period. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that GrSRB1 could interact with the outer capsid protein of GCRV (VP5 and VP7). These results suggest that GrSRB1 could be a receptor for GCRV. We have managed to characterize the GrSRB1 gene and provide evidence for its potential functions for GCRV entry into host cells."
0,"A brief review on the common characteristics and specific features of proteolytic machinery in fish skeletal muscles (based on Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., Salmonidae) has been given. Among a variety of proteases in the muscle tissue, those determining protein degradation level in developing and intensively growing muscles in salmon young and by this way regulating protein retention intensity and growth at all namely lysosomal cathepsins B and D and calcium-dependent proteases (calpains) were comprehensively studied. Revealed age-related differences in intracellular protease activity in salmon skeletal muscles indicate the role of proteolysis regulation in growth in general and a specific role of the individual proteolytic enzymes in particular. The data on negative correlation of cathepsin D and calpain activity levels in muscles and the rate of weight increase in juvenile salmon were obtained. A revealed positive correlation of cathepsin B activity and morphometric parameters in fish young presumably indicates its primary contribution to non-myofibrillar protein turnover."
0,"Salmonid alphavirus (SAV), the aetiological agent of pancreas disease, is recognized as a serious pathogen of farmed Atlantic salmon. This disease results in loss of weight followed by poor growth of surviving fish, as such it is viewed as a wasting disease. SAV and other chronic disease causing viruses affect the heart and skeletal muscle tissues, at present the mechanisms by which pathology occurs is unknown. The relationship between antiviral activity and other physiological parameters especially in skeletal muscle are currently not examined in depth in fish. An experimental SAV (isotype 3) infection was carried out using a cohabitation approach, from which samples were collected at 0, 4, 8 & 12 week post challenge. Maximum viral load in the muscle tissue was 4 weeks post infection which was reduced at 8 weeks and undetectable by 12 weeks. Histopathology score peaked at 4 weeks post infection in pancreas and heart whereas there was maximum damage in skeletal muscle at 8 weeks. The peak expression of antiviral immune genes coincided with the viral load. Several genes involved in protein degradation were increased following infection including atrogin-1 and cathepsin D, at 4 weeks post challenge suggesting reallocation of amino acid reserves. Taken together, these observations increase our understanding of salmon poor growth during viral infection, and will serve as a basis to develop strategies to manage this viral wasting disease. "
0,"Temperature is an important factor influencing teleost muscle growth, including a lasting ('imprinted') influence of embryonic thermal experience throughout all further life. However, little is known about the cellular processes behind this phenomenon. The study reported here used digital morphometry and immunolabelling for Pax7, myogenin and H3P to quantitatively examine the effects of thermal history on muscle precursor cell (MPC) behaviour and muscle growth in pearlfish (Rutilus meidingeri) until the adult stage. Fish were reared at three different temperatures (8.5, 13 and 16°C) until hatching and subsequently kept under the same (ambient) thermal conditions. Cellularity data were combined with a quantitative analysis of Pax7+ MPCs including those that were mitotically active (Pax7+/H3P+) or had entered differentiation (Pax7+/myogenin+). The results demonstrate that at hatching, body lengths, fast and slow muscle cross-sectional areas and fast fibre numbers are lower in fish reared at 8.5 and 13°C than at 16°C. During the larval period, this situation changes in the 13°C-fish, so that these fish are finally the largest. The observed effects can be related to divergent cellular mechanisms at the MPC level that are initiated in the embryo during the imprinting period. Embryos of 16°C-fish have reduced MPC proliferation but increased differentiation, and thus give rise to larger hatchlings. However, their limited MPC reserves finally lead to smaller adults. By contrast, embryos of 13°C-fish and, to a lesser extent, 8.5°-fish, show enhanced MPC proliferation but reduced differentiation, thus leading to smaller hatchlings but allowing for a larger MPC pool that can be used for enhanced post-hatching growth, finally resulting in larger adults."
0,"Myostatin (MSTN), previously referred to as growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8), is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. In accordance with this role, natural mutations that inactivate the gene disrupting the function of the protein are associated with excessive muscle growth and double-muscling phenotype in several mammalian species. Recent studies using transgenic MSTN deficient zebrafish and medaka support the idea that this gene inhibits skeletal muscle growth even in fish. If the atrophic actions of mammalian MSTN are indeed conserved in fish, strategies capable of inhibiting the expression of this gene could be applied to enhance growth performance in livestock production. Gene silencing by RNA interference has emerged as a promising new method of inhibiting the expression of targeted genes and inducing knockdown of associated proteins both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, we investigated here whether double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or different plasmids expressing short-hairpin interfering RNAs (shRNAs) against myostatin and transduced by in vivo electroporation would increase skeletal muscle mass in reared European sea bass. After 7 weeks of intramuscular injections on a weekly basis followed by in vivo electrically mediated dsRNA delivery, no increase in the condition factor (K) of fish was observed as compared to the controls. Analogously, mean body weight and K of sea bass injected with three shRNAs were not higher than those of the control fish. On the other hand, MSTN transcript quantification via real-time RT-PCR revealed a significant inhibition of gene expression in the muscle of the dsRNA-injected fish and in the muscle of fish injected with one of the three tested shRNA-expressing vector constructs. In conclusion, in vivo electric-mediated delivery of dsRNA- or shRNA-expressing vectors against MSTN inhibits MSTN gene expression in adult sea bass muscle, but this is associated with an inconsistent double-muscle phenotype."
0,"Bcl6B, also known as BAZF, plays important roles in the immune response, repression of cancers, and maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells in mammals. In this study, the homologous gene bcl6b and its 5 alternative splicing variants, namely bcl6bX1 to bcl6bX5, were isolated from medaka fish, Oryzias latipes. Medaka bcl6b possesses conserved domains such as BTB domain, RD2 domain and four zinc fingers. Medaka bcl6bX1 to bcl6bX3 possess all three previously mentioned domains with minor differences in sequences. Medaka bcl6bX4 possesses only the BTB domain due to premature stopping, and bcl6bX5 possesses both the BTB domain and zinc fingers without the RD2 domain. Medaka bcl6b was expressed in the tissues including the brain, heart, gill, muscle, spleen, kidney, intestine, ovary and testes of adult fish. Medaka bcl6b was expressed in the embryos from very early stage, and could be detected clearly in the developing eyes by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Medaka bcl6b could respond to the stimuli of polyI:C and LPS in the kidney and spleen. Medaka bcl6bX1 to bcl6bX3 were the majority of the variants expressed in the adult tissues and the embryos, and were the major response to the stimulation of polyI:C and LPS in the spleen. These results suggested that bcl6b, including its isoforms, could function in various tissues and embryogenesis. Moreover, bcl6b might be a factor for immune response in medaka."
0,"In order to understand the molecular basis underlying the host immune response of koi carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>), Illumina HiSeq<sup>TM</sup> 2000 is used to analyze the muscle and spleen transcriptome of koi carp infected with <i>Aeromonas sobria</i> (<i>A. sobria</i>). <i>De novo</i> assembly of paired-end reads yielded 69,480 unigenes, of which the total length, average length, N50, and GC content are 70,120,028 bp, 1037 bp, 1793 bp, and 45.77%, respectively. Annotation is performed by comparison against various databases, yielding 42,229 (non-redundant protein sequence (NR): 60.78%), 59,255 (non-redundant nucleotide (NT): 85.28%), 35,900 (Swiss-Prot: 51.67%), 11,772 (clusters of orthologous groups (COG): 16.94%), 33,057 (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG): 47.58%), 18,764 (Gene Ontology (GO): 27.01%), and 32,085 (Interpro: 46.18%) unigenes. Comparative analysis of the expression profiles between bacterial challenge fish and control fish identifies 7749 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the muscle and 7846 DEGs from the spleen. These DEGs are further categorized with KEGG. Enrichment analysis of the DEGs and unigenes reveals major immune-related functions, including up-regulation of genes related with Toll-like receptor signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, and antigen processing and presentation. The results from RNA-Seq data are also validated and confirmed the consistency of the expression levels of seven immune-related genes after 24 h post infection with qPCR. Microsatellites (11,534), including di-to hexa nucleotide repeat motifs, are also identified. Altogether, this work provides valuable insights into the underlying immune mechanisms elicited during bacterial infection in koi carp that may aid in the future development of disease control measures in protection against <i>A. sobria</i>."
0,"Postmortem alteration by apoptosis has significant effects on flesh quality. Currently, the information necessary to understand the apoptotic behavior and the molecular mechanisms during postmortem alteration in fish muscle is still lacking. Activation of apoptosis and the cytokines involved in regulating apoptosis in fish muscle were evaluated during postmortem condition at 4 °C for 5 days in terms of apoptotic morphology changes, nucleus DNA fragmentation, caspases activation and related gene expressions. The triggering apoptotic mechanisms associated with multiple cytokines transcriptional levels showed that the up-regulated pro-apoptotic mediators [IFN-γ2, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17D, IL-12p35 and IL-10 (except IL-15)] and the down-regulated anti-apoptotic mediators of [IL-8 and IL-11 (except TGF-β and IL-4)] both regulated apoptosis at early stage, which were regulated by NF-κB and TOR, respectively. Results suggested that transcriptional regulation of multiple cytokines produce a positive outcome on triggering apoptosis."
0,"Rainbow trout with gene editing-induced reductions in serum insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-2b exhibit similar growth performance compared to fish without IGFBP-2b gene disruption. The objective of this study is to determine how the components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/IGFBP system respond to a reduction in serum IGFBP-2b abundance. Editing the IGFBP-2b genes in rainbow trout resulted in an 83% decrease in serum IGFBP-2b in mutants. This resulted in a 35% reduction in serum IGF-I, which was offset by reduced expression of hepatic <i>igfbp-1a2</i> and increased muscle <i>igfr-1a</i>; these responses suggest that an increased IGF-I signaling capacity offset reductions in serum IGF-I. During feed deprivation, the differential expression of <i>igfbp</i> genes supports the attenuation of the growth inhibitory response, likely due to the further reduction in serum IGF-I that alleviated the need for an IGF-inhibitory response. Unique <i>igfbp</i> expression patterns occurred during refeeding, suggesting an enhanced IGF-I signaling capacity in controls. Collectively, these findings support that the role of IGFBP-2b is to regulate serum IGF-I concentrations. The compensatory regulation of IGF/IGFBP system genes indicates that adjustments in other IGFBP, both circulating and at the local level, maintain IGF-I signaling at a level appropriate for the nutritional state of the fish."
0,"Fish-borne parasitic zoonoses such as Anisakiasis were once limited to people living in countries where raw or undercooked fish is traditionally consumed. Nowadays, several factors, such as the growing international markets, the improved transportation systems, the population movements, and the expansion of ethnic ways of cooking in developed countries, have increased the population exposed to these parasites. Improved diagnosis technology and a better knowledge of the symptoms by clinicians have increased the Anisakiasis cases worldwide. Dietary recommendations to Anisakis-sensitized patients include the consumption of frozen or well-cooked fish, but these probably do not defend sensitized patients from allergen exposure. The aim of our work was to develop a sensitive and specific method to detect and quantify Anisakis simplex allergens in fish muscle and its derivatives. Protein extraction was made in saline buffer followed by preparation under acid conditions. A. simplex antigens were detected by IgG immunoblot and quantified by dot blot. The allergenic properties of the extracts were assessed by IgE immunoblotting and basophil activation test. We were able to detect less than 1 ppm of A. simplex antigens, among them the allergen Ani s 4, in fish muscle with no cross-reactions and with a recovery rate of 82.5%. A. simplex antigens were detected in hakes and anchovies but not in sardines, red mullets, or shellfish. We detected A. simplex allergens in cooked hakes and also in hake stock. We proved that A. simplex allergens are preserved in long-term frozen storage (-20 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C for 11 months) of parasitized hakes. Basophil activation tests have proven the capability of the A. simplex-positive fish extracts to induce allergic symptoms."
0,"Omnivorous fish species such as the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) are able to biosynthesise long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) from plant oil PUFA precursors, but the influence of the amount and quality of the LC-PUFAs biosynthesised from these oils on the immunocompetence status of the fish has received little attention. This study aims to evaluate whether the conversion of PUFA by carp induces a sufficient biosynthesis of LC-PUFA to maintain a good immunocompetence status in this species. Six iso-nitrogenous (crude protein = 39.1%) and iso-lipidic (crude lipids = 10%) diets containing three different lipid sources (cod liver oil (CLO) as fish oil; linseed oil (LO) and sunflower oil (SFO) as plant oils) were formulated with or without β-glucan supplementation at 0.25 g/kg diet. Juvenile carp (16.3 ± 0.6 g initial body weight) were fed a daily ration of 4% body weight for 9 weeks and then infected at day 64 with the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophyla. No significant differences in survival rate, final body weight, specific growth rate and feed conversion rate were observed between diets. After bacterial infection, mortality rate did not differ between fish fed CLO and plant oil-based diets, indicating that the latter oils did not affect the overall immunocompetence status of common carp. Plant oil-based diets did not alter lysozyme activity in healthy and infected fish. No negative effects of plant oils on complement activity (ACH50) were observed in healthy fish, even if both plant oil-based diets induced a decrease in stimulated fish two days after infection. Furthermore, the levels of various immune genes (nk, lys, il-8, pla, pge, alox) were not affected by plant oil-based diets. The expression of pla and pge genes were higher in SFO-fed fish than in CLO ones, indicating that this plant oil rich in linoleic acid (LA) better stimulated the eicosanoid metabolism process than fish oil. In response to β-glucan supplementation, some innate immune functions seemed differentially affected by plant oil-based diets. LO and SFO induced substantial LC-PUFA production, even if fish fed CLO displayed the highest EPA and DHA levels in tissues. SFO rich in LA induced the highest ARA levels in fish muscle while LO rich in α-linolenic acid (ALA) sustained higher EPA production than SFO. A significantly higher fads-6a expression level was observed in SFO fish than in LO ones, but this was not observed for elovl5 expression. In conclusion, the results show that common carp fed plant oil-based diets are able to produce substantial amounts of LC-PUFA for sustaining growth rate, immune status and disease resistance similar to fish fed a fish oil-based diet. The differences in the production capacity of LC-PUFAs by the two plant oil-based diets were associated to a differential activation of some immune pathways, explaining how the use of these oils did not affect the overall immunocompetence of fish challenged with bacterial infection. Moreover, plant oil-based diets did not induce substantial negative effects on the immunomodulatory action of β-glucans, confirming that these oils are suitable for sustaining a good immunocompetence status in common carp."
0,"Since it was proposed to be a tumor suppressor in 1991, QM protein has attracted intensive and wide attention in plants, animals and fungi research fields. Up to date, however, the function of QM protein in fish immunity remains unknown. In this investigation, a QM gene (named as LycQM gene) was cloned from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), and LycQM protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The LycQM gene was ubiquitously transcribed in multi-tissues, including spleen, muscle, heart, liver, intestine, blood and head kidney. By quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis, we found the highest and the lowest expression level of LycQM gene in head kidney and in heart, respectively. Time course analysis showed that LycQM expression was obviously up-regulated in blood and head kidney after immunization with polyinosinic polycytidynic acid (poly I:C), formalin-inactive Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Moreover, as demonstrated by RNAi assays, LycQM protein could regulate the activity of phenoloxidase, a key enzyme in the proPO activation system of immunity. These results suggested that LycQM protein might play an important role in the immune response against microorganisms in large yellow croaker."
0,"To study adaptation of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) to hypoxic stress, we investigated physiological responses and lactate metabolism of the fish under acute hypoxia. The objectives of this study were to (a) observe changes in glucose, glycogen, and lactate content; (b) detect the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in serum, brain, heart, and liver tissues; and (c) quantify the dynamic gene expression of AMP activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKα), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), and lactate dehydrogenase-a (LDHa) following exposure to hypoxia. The fish were subjected to two hypoxia stresses (dissolved oxygen [DO] 1.20 ± 0.2 mg/L and 3.50 ± 0.3 mg/L, respectively) for 24 h. Our results showed that hypoxic stress significantly increased the decomposition of liver glycogen and significantly increased the concentration of blood glucose; however, the muscle glycogen content was not significantly decreased, which indicates that liver glycogen was the main energy source under acute hypoxia. Moreover, hypoxia led to accumulation of a large amount of lactic acid in tissues, possibly due to the activity of lactic acid dehydrogenase, but this process was delayed in the heart and brain relative to the liver. Additionally, hypoxia induced the expression of AMPKα, HIF-1α, MCT1, MCT4, and LDHa, suggesting that glycometabolism had switched from aerobic to anaerobic. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the response to hypoxia in largemouth bass."
0,"Marine puffer fish accumulate a high level of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in the liver and ovary, but the underlying mechanism of this toxification is unclear. To elucidate the genes related to toxification of the marine puffer fish, we examined the hepatic gene expression profile of the marine puffer fish Takifugu rubripes by suppression subtractive hybridization in response to the intramuscular administration of 0.50 mg TTX/kg body weight into the caudal muscle. The accumulation of TTX in the liver reached 68 ± 4% that of the administered dose within 12 h of administration. A total of 1048 clones from the subtracted cDNA libraries were successfully sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of 92 of the 1048 clones was identified as a hepcidin precursor. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed that hepcidin precursors were highly expressed in the TTX-administered group. In addition, complement C3 (31 clones), serotransferrin (30 clones), apolipoprotein A-1 (14 clones), high temperature adaptation protein Wap65-2 (14 clones), complement C7 (12 clones), fibrinogen beta chain (12 clones), and 70 kDa heat-shock protein 4 (11 clones) were obtained. This study confirmed that the intramuscular administration of TTX increases the gene expression of the acute-phase response proteins in the liver of puffer fish T. rubripes."
0,"One objective of this study was to identify putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect indicator phenotypes for growth, nitrogen, and carbon metabolism in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, and for feed efficiency. Another objective was to perform an RNAseq analysis (184 fish from all families), to identify genes that are associated with carbon and nitrogen metabolism in the liver. The material consisted of a family experiment that was performed in freshwater and included 2281 individuals from 23 full-sib families. During the 12-day feed conversion test, families were randomly allocated to family tanks (50 fish per tank and 2 tanks per family) and fed a fishmeal-based diet labeled with the stable isotopes <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C at inclusion levels of 2 and 1%, respectively."
1,"Using a linear mixed-model algorithm, a QTL for pre-smolt growth was identified on chromosome 9 and a QTL for carbon metabolism in the liver was identified on chromosome 12 that was closely related to feed conversion ratio on a tank level. For the indicators of feed efficiency traits that were derived from the stable isotope ratios (<sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C) of muscle tissue and growth, no convincing QTL was detected, which suggests that these traits are polygenic. The transcriptomic analysis showed that high carbon and nitrogen metabolism was associated with individuals that convert protein from the feed more efficiently, primarily due to higher expression of the proteasome, lipid, and carbon metabolic pathways in liver. In addition, we identified seven transcription factors that were associated with carbon and nitrogen metabolism and located in the identified QTL regions."
2,"Analyses revealed one QTL associated with pre-smolt growth and one QTL for carbon metabolism in the liver. Both of these traits are associated with feed efficiency. However, more accurate mapping of the putative QTL will require a more diverse family material. In this experiment, fish that have a high carbon and nitrogen metabolism in the liver converted protein from the feed more efficiently, potentially because of a higher expression of the proteasome, lipid, and carbon metabolic pathways in liver. Within the QTL regions, we detected seven transcription factors that were associated with carbon and nitrogen metabolism."
0,"Muscle growth is determined primarily by the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. When rates of protein synthesis are similar between individuals, protein degradation is critical in explaining differences in growth efficiency. Studies in mammals showed that muscle atrophy results from increased protein breakdown, and is associated with activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, including induction of the muscle-specific ubiquitin protein ligase, MuRF1. Animals lacking MuRF1 are resistant to muscle atrophy. In fish, little is known about the role of the proteasome/MuRF pathway in muscle degradation. The objectives of this study were to: 1) clone and characterize MuRF genes in rainbow trout; and 2) determine expression of MuRF genes in association with starvation- and vitellogenesis-induced muscle atrophy in rainbow trout. We have identified full-length cDNA sequences for three MuRF genes (MuRF1, MuRF2, and MuRF3). These genes encode proteins with typical MuRF structural domains, including a RING-finger, a B-box and a Leucine-rich coiled-coil domain. RT-PCR analysis showed that MuRF genes are predominantly expressed in muscle and heart tissues. Real time PCR analysis revealed that expression of all MuRF genes is up-regulated during starvation and MuRF3 is up-regulated in vitellogenesis-associated muscle degradation. These results suggest that MuRF genes have an important role in fish muscle protein degradation. Further studies are warranted to assess the potential use of MuRF genes as tools to monitor fish muscle growth and degradation."
0,"The IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) play a dual role in the regulation of the activity and bioavailability of IGFs in different tissues. Diverse evidence has shown that IGFBPs can inhibit and/or potentiate IGF actions. In this study, igfbp1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were isolated in the fine flounder, a flat fish species that shows slow growth and inherent Gh resistance in muscle. Subsequently, the expression of all igfbps was assessed in the skeletal muscle of flounder that underwent different nutritional statuses. igfbp1 was not expressed in muscle during any of the nutritional conditions, whereas igfbp3 and igfbp5 were the lowest and the highest igfbps expressed respectively. A dynamic expression pattern was found in all the igfbps expressed in skeletal muscle, which depended on the nutritional status and sampling period. During the fasting period, igfbp2, 4, and 5 were downregulated, whereas igfbp3 was upregulated during part of the fasting period. The restoration of food modulated the expression of the igfbps dynamically, showing significant changes during both the long- and short-term refeeding. igfbp3 and igfbp6 were downregulated during short-term refeeding, whereas igfbp5 was upregulated, and igfbp2 and igfbp4 remained stable. During long-term refeeding, the expression of igfbp2, 4, 5, and 6 increased, while igfbp3 remained unchanged. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time the isolation of all igfbps in a single fish species, in addition to describing a dynamic nutritional and time-dependent response in the expression of igfbps in the skeletal muscle of a nonmammalian species."
0,"Two interleukin (IL)-17 N genes (CcIL-17Na and b) present on different linkage groups were identified in the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) genome and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real time (RT)-PCR in this experiment. Synteny analysis revealed that IL-17 N is transcribed by the complement sequence of TOP3B's intron 2. It is flanked by SDF2L and PPM1F in all fish studied to date, except fugu (Takifugu rubripes). The open reading frames of the two CcIL-17Ns are 411 base pairs long and encode 136 amino acids. The amino acid identity/similarity between CcIL-17Na and b is 91.2%/97.1%. The CcIL-17Ns share identity (46.8-90.4%) with their orthologs from other teleosts. Identities/similarities to other members of the IL-17 family in common carp were low at 21.4-30.2%/31.4-51.4%. In the phylogenetic tree, IL-17Ns from spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus, the ancestor of teleosts) and coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae, the ancestor of tetrapods) were grouped within the same branch with a high bootstrap value of 97%, which indicates that IL-17 N is an ancient and conserved gene. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that CcIL-17Ns were most highly expressed in the brain of healthy individuals. The expression in brain was significantly induced at 6 h post Aeromonas hydrophila infection; at 1 day post infection, expression in liver, muscle, skin, spleen, and head kidney was up-regulated. In addition, the upregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-6, chemokine CCL20, NF - κ B and TRAF6 in kidney tissue by ccIL-17 N recombinant protein also indicate that IL-17 N can promote inflammation through NF-κB pathway and induce the expression of chemokines and inflammatory factors."
0,"Skeletal muscle has diverse mechanical roles during locomotion. In swimming fish, power-producing muscles work in concert with the accessory muscles of the fins which augment and control power transfer to the water. Although fin muscles represent a significant proportion of the locomotor muscle mass, their physiological properties are poorly characterized. To examine the relationship between muscle metabolism and the differing mechanical demands placed on distinct muscle groups, we quantified the aerobic and glycolytic capacities of the myotomal, pectoral and caudal muscles of bluegill sunfish. These were indicated by the activities of citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase, rate-limiting enzymes for aerobic respiration and glycolysis, respectively. The well-established roles of slow and fast myotomal muscle types in sustained and transient propulsive movements allows their use as benchmarks to which other muscles can be compared to assess their function. Slow myotomal muscle had the highest CS activity, consistent with meeting the high metabolic and mechanical power demands of body-caudal fin (BCF) swimming at the upper end of the aerobically supported speed range. The largest pectoral adductors and abductors had CS activities lower than the slow myotomal muscle, in line with their role supplying thrust for low-speed, low-power swimming. The metabolic capacities of the caudal muscles were surprisingly low and inconsistent with their activity during steady-state BCF swimming at high speeds. This may reflect adaptation to the observed swimming behavior in the field, which typically involved short bouts of BCF-propulsive cycles rather than sustained propulsive activity."
0,"Infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) has caused significant loss in the Mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) aquaculture industry. Vaccination is an important measure to prevent fatal ISKNV infection. In this study, the ORF086 gene encoding an early protein helicase of ISKNV was cloned into the prokaryotic pET32a (+) and eukaryotic pcDNA3.1 (+) expression vectors and designated as pET086 and pcDNA086, respectively. A recombinant 36 kDa protein was detected in Escherichia coli BL21 (harboring pET086) after isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction. Polyclonal antibodies against the purified ORF086 protein were raised in rabbits. The antibody reaction and the pcDNA086 expression in muscle tissues of vaccinated fish were confirmed using Western blot analysis. The protective efficacy of ORF086 was also investigated. The cumulative mortality rates of Mandarin fish were significantly different between immune and control groups (P < 0.05) after ISKNV challenge. The relative percentage survival (RPS) values of the recombinant ORF086 protein emulsified with ISA763A adjuvant and pcDNA086 added with QCDC adjuvant were 73% and 63%, respectively. Transcriptional analysis of non-specific and specific immune related genes revealed that the expression levels of IRF-7, IRAK1, Mx, Viperin, and IgM were strongly up-regulated in the vaccinated groups post-immunization. In particular, the expression levels in the QCDC + pcDNA086 group was higher than those in the control groups (P < 0.05). These results indicated that the early protein ORF086 could be an effective antigen candidate for controlling ISKNV disease in Mandarin fish."
0,"Lysozymes are the key molecules of innate immune system against bacterial infections. In the present study, we identified the molecular characteristics, physicochemical properties, antibacterial activity, evolutionary relationship and tissue expression pattern of g-type lysozyme in Euryglossa orientalis (EuOr LysG). The full-length EuOr LysG cDNA is composed of 588 nucleotides and an open reading frame encoding a protein with 195 amino acids with more than 65 % identity to g-type lysozyme of Solea senegalensis (73 %) and Scophthalmus rhombus (64 %). Amino acid sequence alignment showed that EuOr LysG protein possessed a conserved catalytic motif (Glu71-Asp84-Asp101) and one predicted disulfide bond between Cys32 and Cys122. Phylogenetic analysis based on the g-type lysozyme sequences indicated that E. orientalis and other fish of Pleuronectiformes were diverged together in the evolutionary history. The K <sub>m</sub> and V <sub>max</sub> values of the recombinant EuOr LysG were 0.266 mg/ml of Micrococcus lysodeikticus as substrate and 667 U/mg of protein, respectively. The optimum temperature and pH of recombinant EuOr LysG were 45 and 6 °C, respectively. Real-time PCR analysis showed that EuOr LysG transcript was most abundant in head kidney and gill and less in muscle. We also showed that the EuOr LysG had potent lytic activity against major fish bacterial pathogens with the highest activity against Bacillus cereus and Aeromonas hydrophila. Bacterial challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus could upregulate LysG in immune-related tissues. Our results help to understand the molecular and physicochemical characteristics of g-type lysozyme in E. orientalis which might play an important role in host defense against the bacterial infection."
0,"Various methods have been developed to reprogram mammalian somatic cells into pluripotent cells as well as to directly reprogram somatic cells into other cell lineages. We are interested in applying these methods to fish, and here, we examined whether mRNA expression of germline-specific genes (vasa, nanos2, -3) and pluripotency factors (oct4, sox2, c-myc, nanog) is inducible in somatic cells of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). We found that the expression of vasa is induced in the gut and regenerating fin by exposure to a carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Induction of vasa in the gut started on the 5th day of treatment with >50 ppm DEN. In addition, nanos2, -3, oct4, sox2, klf4, c-myc, and nanog were also expressed simultaneously in some vasa-positive gut and regenerating fin samples. Vasa-positive cells were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the muscle surrounding the gut and in the wound epidermis, blastema, and fibroblast-like cells in regenerating fin. In vasa:GFP transgenic medaka, green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence appeared in the wound epidermis and fibroblast-like cells in the regenerating fin following DEN exposure, in agreement with the IHC data. Our data show that mRNA expression of genes relevant to germ cell specification and pluripotency can be induced in fish somatic cells by exposure to DEN, suggesting the possibility of efficient and rapid cell reprogramming of fish somatic cells."
0,"Cystatin F, a member of the family II cystatins, plays important roles in immune response-related processes through inhibiting specific enzyme targets. In this study, a cystatin F homologue, LycCysF, was identified and characterized from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). The deduced LycCysF protein exhibits a typical structural feature of type II cystatins, including three evolutionally conserved motifs, Gly(35), QVVRG(79-83) and PW(130-131). Tissue expression analysis showed that LycCysF mRNA was expressed in all tissues examined, albeit at different levels. Recombinant LycCysF (rLycCysF) produced in Pichia pastoris could inhibit the activity of multiple cysteine proteases, including papain, legumain and recombinant large yellow croaker cathepsin B, L and S. Moreover, rLycCysF could inhibit the Ii chain processing by recombinant cathepsin S in vitro. These data suggest that LycCysF may participate in regulation of cathepsins and MHC-II associated Ii chain processing. In addition, mammalian cystatin F is produced as an inactive dimer, becoming activated by proteolysis in the endo/lysosome of immune cells and then exerts its function of regulating downstream proteases activity. However, the N-terminal extension and two additional cysteine residues responsible for dimer formation are absent in LycCysF and cystatin F from other fish species, reptiles and Aves, indicating that these proteins can not form dimer and may regulate the proteases activity via an alternate pathway distinct from mammalian cystatin F. To our knowledge, this is the first report on molecular characteristics of a teleost cystatin F and its role in Ii chain processing. "
0,"Effects of 17β-estradiol (E2), testosterone, and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on protein turnover and proteolytic gene expression were determined in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) primary myocytes and white muscle tissue. E2 reduced rates of protein synthesis and increased rates of protein degradation in primary myocytes by 45% and 27%, respectively. DHT reduced rates of protein synthesis by 27%. Testosterone did not affect protein synthesis and neither testosterone nor DHT affected rates of protein degradation. Single injections of E2 increased expression of ubiquitin ligase genes fbxo32, fbxo25, and murf1, and the proteasome subunit psmd6 by 24h after injection. Within the cathepsin-lysosome pathway, E2 increased expression of cathepsins ctsd and ctsl, as well as autophagy-related genes atg4b and lc3b. Additionally, E2 injection up-regulated the expression of casp3 and casp9 caspase genes. Incubation of primary myocytes with E2 also increased expression of ubiquitin ligase genes. Therefore, catabolic effects of E2 on protein turnover result in part from E2-induced increases in proteolytic gene expression directly in muscle. Injection of testosterone increased milli-calpain (capn2) and casp3 expression, and DHT increased ctsd expression in vivo, whereas both androgens up-regulated fbxo32 expression in primary myocytes. These results suggest that effects of androgens on protein turnover in muscle are not driven primarily by direct effects of these hormones in this tissue."
0,"In centrarchid fishes, such as bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus, Rafinesque) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides, Lacepède), the contractile properties of feeding and swimming muscles show different scaling patterns. While the maximum shortening velocity (V(max)) and rate of relaxation from tetanus of swimming or myotomal muscle slow with growth, the feeding muscle shows distinctive scaling patterns. Cranial epaxial muscle, which is used to elevate the head during feeding strikes, retains fast contractile properties across a range of fish sizes in both species. In bass, the sternohyoideous muscle, which depresses the floor of the mouth during feeding strikes, shows faster contractile properties with growth. The objective of this study was to determine the molecular basis of these different scaling patterns. We examined the expression of two muscle proteins, myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and parvalbumin (PV), that affect contractile properties. We hypothesized that the relative contribution of slow and fast MyHC isoforms will modulate V(max) in these fishes, while the presence of PV in muscle will enhance rates of muscle relaxation. Myotomal muscle displays an increase in sMyHC expression with growth, in agreement with its physiological properties. Feeding muscles such as epaxial and sternohyoideus show no change or a decrease in sMyHC expression with growth, again as predicted from contractile properties. PV expression in myotomal muscle decreases with growth in both species, as has been seen in other fishes. The feeding muscles again show no change or an increase in PV expression with growth, contributing to faster contractile properties in these fishes. Both MyHC and PV appear to play important roles in modulating muscle contractile properties of swimming and feeding muscles in centrarchid fishes."
0,"Bluefin tuna are high-performance swimmers and top predators in the open ocean. Their swimming is grounded by unique features including an exceptional glycolytic potential in white muscle, which is supported by high enzymatic activities. Here we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in muscles of the Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and conducted a comparative transcriptomic analysis of genes related to energy production. We found that the total expression of glycolytic genes was much higher in the white muscle of tuna than in the other muscles, and that the expression of only six genes for glycolytic enzymes accounted for 83.4% of the total. These expression patterns were in good agreement with the patterns of enzyme activity previously reported. The findings suggest that the mRNA expression of glycolytic genes may contribute directly to the enzymatic activities in the muscles of tuna. "
0,"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) is a secreted protein that binds and regulates IGF actions in controlling growth, development, reproduction, and aging. Elevated expression of IGFBP-2 is often associated with progression of many types of cancers."
1,"We report the identification and characterization of two IGFBP-2 genes in zebrafish and four other teleost fish. Comparative genomics and structural analyses suggest that they are co-orthologs of the human IGFBP-2 gene. Biochemical assays show that both zebrafish igfbp-2a and -2b encode secreted proteins that bind IGFs. These two genes exhibit distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns. During embryogenesis, IGFBP-2a mRNA is initially detected in the lens, then in the brain boundary vasculature, and subsequently becomes highly expressed in the liver. In the adult stage, liver has the highest levels of IGFBP-2a mRNA, followed by the brain. Low levels of IGFBP-2a mRNA were detected in muscle and in the gonad in male adults only. IGFBP-2b mRNA is detected initially in all tissues at low levels, but later becomes abundant in the liver. In adult males, IGFBP-2b mRNA is only detected in the liver. In adult females, it is also found in the gut, kidney, ovary, and muscle. To gain insights into how the IGFBP-2 genes may have evolved through partitioning of ancestral functions, functional and mechanistic studies were carried out. Expression of zebrafish IGFBP-2a and -2b caused significant decreases in the growth and developmental rates and their effects are comparable to that of human IGFBP-2. IGFBP-2 mutants with altered IGF binding-, RGD-, and heparin-binding sites were generated and their actions examined. While mutating the RGD and heparin binding sites had little effect, altering the IGF binding site abolished its biological activity."
2,These results suggest that IGFBP-2 is a conserved regulatory protein and it inhibits growth and development primarily by binding to and inhibiting IGF actions in vivo. The duplicated IGFBP-2 genes may provide additional flexibility in the regulation of IGF activities.
0,Fish muscle responds to aerobic exercise training and cold acclimation with a more aerobic muscle phenotype than mammalian muscle but through both conserved and distinct molecular events. Differences from mammals in exercise metabolism and diversity in protein isoforms suggest that the regulation of muscle fuel use is more complex in fish. This review considers fish as powerful models for exercise and muscle physiology.
0,"The barbel chub Squaliobarbus curriculus is an important commercial fish species in China, and has shown significant resistance to grass carp reovirus (GCRV). In this study, the cDNA sequence of interferon regulatory factors 3 (IRF3) from Squaliobarbus curriculus, designated as ScIRF3, was cloned, and its effect against GCRV was investigated. The full-length 1837 base pair (bp) cDNA of ScIRF3 contained a complete open reading frame of 1374 bp and encoded a putative polypeptide of 457 amino acid residues. The ScIRF3 protein contained conserved domains, including an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a C-terminal IRF association domain, and a serine-rich domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ScIRF3 was closely clustered with IRF3s from Carassius auratus and Ctenopharyngodon idellus. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the expression levels of ScIRF3 in Squaliobarbus curriculus were the highest in the spleen and lowest in the muscle. After GCRV infection, expression levels of both ScIRF3 and type I interferon (IFN) were initially up-regulated and subsequently down-regulated in the spleen and intestine. Correlation analysis showed that the expression level of type I IFN is significantly positively correlated with that of ScIRF3 (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.883, P: 0.004) in the intestine. The expression level of type I IFN was also significantly up-regulated and the GCRV titer was significantly decreased (P < .05) in GCRV-infected ScIRF3-overexpressing Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney cells. These results indicate that ScIRF3 may play a role in the type I IFN immune response against GCRV in Squaliobarbus curriculus and can also inhibit GCRV replication in Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney cells."
0,"Nrf2 is an important transcription factor involved in the antioxidant response and is widely expressed in animal tissues. The function of Nrf2 is regulated by its negative regulator Keap1 by inducing its cytoplasmic degradation. Recent studies have suggested that Nrf2 is also regulated post-transcriptionally via miRNAs. However, to date, how miRNAs regulate Nrf2 in fish skeletal muscles is unknown. In this study, the full-length cDNAs with 2398 bp of the Nrf2 was firstly cloned by SMART RACE amplification tools from Chinese perch. The Nrf2 gene structure and its 3'-UTR region for possible miRNA binding sites, as well as its spatial expression profile were assayed. Then, we employed TargetScan Fish tool MiRNAnome to predict putative sites for five miRNAs including miR-181a-5p, MiR-194a, MiR-216a, miR-459-5p, and miR-724. Using qRT-PCR assay, we found that Nrf2 mRNA levels have negative correlation with all five miRNAs expression in muscle of nutritionally deprived fish, and that ectopic expression of miR-181a-5p alone reduces Nrf2 mRNA levels. Luciferase reporter assay in a heterologous cell system revealed that each of the five miRNAs reduced Nrf2 expression, suggesting a direct regulatory mechanism. Moreover, the miR-181a-5p suppression using specific antagomir led to a significant increase in Nrf2 expression in vivo. At the same time, the expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes CAT, ZnSOD, GPx, GSTA, and GSTA genes increased significantly after injecting miR-181a-5p antagomir. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that miRNAs are involved in the Nrf2 signaling networks in regulation of oxidative stress in fish, at least in Chinese perch muscle."
0,"The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that dietary arginine promotes digestion and absorption capacity, and, thus, enhances fish growth. This improvement might be related to the target of rapamycin (TOR) and eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP). A total of 1200 juvenile Jian carp, Cyprinus carpio var. Jian, with an average initial weight of 6.33 (SE 0.03) g, were fed with diets containing graded concentrations of arginine, namely, 9.8 (control), 12.7, 16.1, 18.5, 21.9 and 24.5 g arginine/kg diet for 9 weeks. An real-time quantitative PCR analysis was performed to determine the relative expression of TOR and 4E-BP in fish muscle, hepatopancreas and intestine. Dietary arginine increased (P < 0.05): (1) glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase activities in muscle and hepatopancreas; (2) intestine and hepatopancreas protein content, folds height, and trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and creatine kinase activities in intestine; (3) Lactobacillus counts; (4) relative expression of TOR in the muscle, hepatopancreas and distal intestine (DI); (5) relative expression of 4E-BP in proximal intestine (PI) and mid-intestine (MI), as compared with the control group. In contrast, dietary arginine reduced (P < 0.05): (1) plasma ammonia content; (2) Aeromonas hydrophila and Escherichia coli counts; (3) relative expression of TOR in PI and MI; (4) relative expression of 4E-BP in the muscle, hepatopancreas and DI. The arginine requirement estimated by specific growth rate using quadratic regression analysis was found to be 18.0 g/kg diet. These results indicate that arginine improved fish growth, digestive and absorptive ability and regulated the expression of TOR and 4E-BP genes."
0,"Transforming growth factor-β-activating kinase 1 (TAK1) is triggered by foreign pathogenic infection and involves in proinflammatory response through the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which is specifically regulated by TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1). However, the expression and regulatory characterizations of TAK1 and TAB1 in fish immune response remain largely unknown. In the present study, the cDNA sequences of TAK1 (LcTAK1) and TAB1 (LcTAB1) were identified from large yellow croaker, Larimichthys crocea. The open reading frame (ORF) of LcTAK1 was 1725 bp in length, encoding 574 amino acids. The putative LcTAK1 protein contained a protein kinase domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil region. The ORF of LcTAB1 was 1518 bp encoding 505 amino acids. And a typical PP2Cc domain and a conserved sequence motif (PYVDFSQFYLLWGSDH) at C-terminal were identified in the predicted LcTAB1 protein. Multiple alignments showed that LcTAK1 shared 74.0-97.9% and LcTAB1 shared 37.4-95.8% sequence identities with TAK1 and TAB1 proteins from other species, respectively. Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that both LcTAK1 and LcTAB1 were broadly expressed in all examined tissues, with the most predominant expression in brain and the weakest expression in muscle, respectively. Subcellular localization revealed that both LcTAK1 and LcTAB1 expressed in the cytoplasm. In addition, LcTAK1 transcripts increased significantly in LCK cells after flagellin, LPS and poly I:C stimulation while LcTAB1 enhanced greatly after LPS and poly I:C challenge. Furthermore, the roles of them in NF-κB activation were investigated by overexpression of LcTAK1 and LcTAB1 in HEK293T cells. Our results revealed that NF-κB luciferase promoter expression could not be induced by overexpression of LcTAK1 or LcTAB1 alone, however, it could be induced by co-expression of LcTAK1 and LcTAB1 together. Moreover, the roles of LcTAK1 and LcTAB1 in immune response analysis showed that NF-κB activation enhanced significantly in co-overexpressed HEK293T cells following LPS and poly I:C stimulation. However, the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 were induced only after LPS challenge (p < .05). These findings suggested that the TAK1-TAB1 complex of large yellow croaker might play an important role in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine release after LPS stimulation via inducing NF-κB activation."
0,"As crucial signaling transducer in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling pathway, IL-1R-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) mediates downstream signaling cascades and plays important roles in innate and adaptive immune responses. In the present study, an IRAK4 orthologue was characterized from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), named Lc-IRAK4, with a conservative N-terminal death domain and a C-terminal protein kinase domain. The genome of Lc-IRAK4 is structured into eleven exons and ten introns. Expression analysis indicated that Lc-IRAK4 was widely expressed in tested tissues, with the highest level in liver and weakest in muscle. Additionally, in the spleen, liver tissues and blood, it could be induced by poly I:C and LPS stimulation, but not be induced by Vibrio parahemolyticus infection. Fluorescence microscopy assays revealed that Lc-IRAK4 localized in the cytoplasm in HEK 293T cells. It was also determined that Lc-IRAK4 could interact with MyD88, whereas MyD88-mediated NF-κB activation was significantly impaired when co-transfected the two in HEK 293T cells. These findings collectively indicated that although Lc-IRAK4 was evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates, the exact function especially the signaling transduction mediated by IRAK4 in fish immune response was different from that in mammals, which impaired MyD88-mediated NF-κB activation."
0,"The impacts of bacterial infection on cultivated fish species, African catfish, were investigated using oxidative stress biomarkers [lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation] and the activities of important antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes [catalase and glutathione S-transferase (GST)]. Fish were inoculated via oral gavage with one of the following treatments: 1 × 10(5) CFU/ml of Escherichia coli (EC1), 2 × 10(5) CFU/ml of E. coli (EC2), 1 × 10(5) CFU/ml of Vibrio fischeri (V1), 2 × 10(5) CFU/ml of V. fischeri (V2), gavaged with distilled water and not gavaged. Fish were maintained in the laboratory for 7 days after the bacterial inoculation, and the levels of LPO, protein carbonylation, GST, and catalase activities were determined in the muscle, gills, and liver of fish. Fish inoculated with bacteria (either E. coli or V. fischeri) had a significant higher levels of tissue LPO, protein carbonylation, and GST activities in a tissue-specific pattern (liver > muscle > gills). This appears to be related with the levels of bacterial inoculation, with effects more pronounced in fish inoculated with either EC2 or V2. The catalase activity did not differ significantly between the inoculated and fish that were not inoculated. The results of this study indicate that bacterial inoculation could result in oxidative stress in fish, and liver has a higher rate of oxidative stress per mg tissue compared to the gills and the muscle."
0,"Due to limited fish meal and fish oil resources and their high costs for the aquaculture industry, it is necessary to find alternative sustainable sources of protein and lipids. Therefore, seven different diets were formulated with different levels of animal by-products, vegetable proteins, fish oil and rapeseed oil, to feed farmed Atlantic salmon, and their effects on growth performance, muscle lipid class, and fatty acid composition were examined. Protein sources included anchovy, poultry, feather, blood, corn, soy and wheat. Growth performance indicated that the diet with the lowest fish meal and fish oil content resulted in the lowest weight gain and final weight, followed by the diet containing the highest level of animal by-products. The lipid class analysis showed no statistical difference in the muscle total lipid content using different diets. However, significant statistical differences were observed among the main lipid classes; triacylglycerols, phospholipids, and sterols. The diet containing 1.4% omega-3 long-chain fatty acids resulted in the highest content of triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Diets containing medium and low levels of fish oil and fish meal, respectively, led to as high a level of ω3 fatty acids in muscle as when fish were fed diets with high levels of fish meal and fish oil. The results of this study suggest that feeding a diet containing low levels of fish meal and moderate levels of fish oil does not significantly affect ω3 fatty acid composition in muscle. Fish meal could be reduced to 5% without affecting growth as long as there was a minimum of 5% fish oil, and animal by-products did not exceed 26% of the diet."
0,"The promotion of muscle recovery after immobilization is important to preserve an optimum health status. Here, we examined the effect of dietary Alaska pollack protein (APP) on skeletal muscle weight after atrophy induced by hind limb immobilization using plaster immobilization technique. Rat left limb was casted with a wetted plaster cast under anesthesia. After 2 weeks of feeding, the cast was removed and the rats were divided into three groups, namely, a baseline group, high-fat casein diet group, and high-fat APP diet group. After 3 weeks of feeding, the skeletal muscles (soleus, extensor digitorum longus [EDL], and gastrocnemius) were sampled. The estimated weight gains of soleus, gastrocnemius, and EDL muscle in the immobilized limbs were significantly larger in the rats fed with APP diet as compared with those fed with casein diet. In soleus muscle, dietary APP increased the expression of Igf1 and Myog genes in the immobilized limbs after the recovery period."
0,"Aquaculture of piscivorous fish is in continual expansion resulting in a global requirement to reduce the dependence on wild caught fish for generation of fishmeal and fish oil. Plant proteins represent a suitable protein alternative to fish meal and are increasingly being used in fish feed. In this study, we examined the transcriptional response of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to a high marine protein (MP) or low fishmeal, higher plant protein replacement diet (PP), formulated to the same nutritional specification within previously determined acceptable maximum levels of individual plant feed materials."
1,"After 77 days of feeding the fish in both groups doubled in weight, however neither growth performance, feed efficiency, condition factor nor organ indices were significantly different. Assessment of histopathological changes in the heart, intestine or liver did not reveal any negative effects of the PP diet. Transcriptomic analysis was performed in mid intestine, liver and skeletal muscle, using an Atlantic salmon oligonucleotide microarray (Salar_2, Agilent 4x44K). The dietary comparison revealed large alteration in gene expression in all the tissues studied between fish on the two diets. Gene ontology analysis showed, in the mid intestine of fish fed PP, higher expression of genes involved in enteritis, protein and energy metabolism, mitochondrial activity/kinases and transport, and a lower expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis compared to fish fed MP. The liver of fish fed PP showed a lower expression of immune response genes but a higher expression of cell proliferation and apoptosis processes that may lead to cell reorganization in this tissue. The skeletal muscle of fish fed PP vs MP was characterized by a suppression of processes including immune response, energy and protein metabolism, cell proliferation and apoptosis which may reflect a more energy efficient tissue."
2,"The PP diet resulted in significant effects on transcription in all the 3 tissues studied. Despite of these alterations, we demonstrated that high level of plant derived proteins in a salmon diet allowed fish to grow with equal efficiency as those on a high marine protein diet, and with no difference in biometric quality parameters."
0,"Insulin-like growth factor binding-protein 5 (igfbp5), the most conserved member of the IGFBP family in vertebrates, plays a critical role in controlling cell survival, growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Here, we characterized the expression patterns of igfbp5a and igfbp5b in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), which are retained in many fish species, likely from the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication. Both igfbp5a and igfbp5b encode 268- and 263-aa peptides, respectively, which share a sequence identity of 71%. Their mRNAs are not detected in zygotes. At 14hpf, grass carp igfbp5b mRNA was detected in the somites, while igfbp5a mRNA has some possible signal around the eye and head region. At 24hpf, both igfbp5a and igfbp5b mRNA appear to be limited to the presomitic mesoderm. At 36hpf, igfbp5a mRNA was only detected in the midbrain, while igfbp5b mRNA was detected in both the midbrain and notochord. Overall, both mRNAs were expressed in most adult tissues. igfbp5a and igfbp5b were significantly upregulated in the muscle and liver after injection of 10μg per kilogram body weight of zebrafish growth hormone (zGH), while their hepatic expression was downregulated by 50μg zGH. During fasting, both igfbp5a and igfbp5b mRNAs were significantly downregulated in the muscle but upregulated in the liver. Collectively, the results suggest that the two igfbp5 genes play important but different roles in the regulation of growth and development in grass carp."
0,"Mx (myxovirus resistance) is an important antiviral protein in the innate immune responses of vertebrates to microbial pathogens. In this study, we cloned and characterized Mx1 of black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus). The full-length cDNA of black carp Mx1 (bcMx1) consists of 2781 nucleotides and the predicted bcMx1 protein contains 631 amino acids. bcMx1 contains a GTPase domain at the N-terminnus, a ""central interactive domain"" in the middle and a GTPase effector domain at the C-terminus. bcMx1 mRNA was constitutively transcribed in all tissues tested, including the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, intestine, muscle, skin and gill; and bcMx1 mRNA levels increased in all but the gill after grass carp reovirus (GCRV) or viraemia of carp virus (SVCV) infection. Quantitative PCR analysis of Mylopharyngodon piceus fin (MPF) cells indicated that bcMx1 mRNA levels increased after GCRV or SVCV infection at different multiplicities of infection (MOI). Western blotting demonstrated that the molecular weight of bcMx1 is ∼75 kDa and immunofluorescent staining data of both HeLa cells and EPC cells showed that bcMx1 is a cytosolic protein. EPC cells transfected with plasmid expressing bcMx1 showed increased antiviral activity against SVCV and GCRV. All our data suggest that bcMx1 is an antiviral protein in the innate immune response of the black carp."
0,"Among various cooking methods, steaming is favored by many because it can cause less damage to nutrient components in muscle, retain the inherent food flavor, and reduce the generation of harmful substances. Steaming conditions are closely related to fish flavor, fat and protein oxidation, and digestibility."
1,"The black carp steamed for 4 to 14 min was studied in this article based on sensory assessment, electronic tongue, free amino acids, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-related compounds, total nitrogen and non-protein nitrogen to explore the effect of steaming time on the taste substances and protein degradation of pickled black carp. The experimental result showed that the meat steamed within 8 min tasted better, showing high tastiness. The sensory assessment score increased significantly to the maximum value of 82.33 at 6 min. The content of umami and sweet amino acids increased significantly to the maximum value of 1.6801 g kg<sup>-1</sup> at 6 min. In the meantime, the IMP (inosine monophosphate) content was 1.9128 g kg<sup>-1</sup> , with its taste activity value (TAV) reaching 7.65, which proved that IMP affected the taste most. Furthermore, the total nitrogen content was 30.77 g kg<sup>-1</sup> , which meant protein degraded a great deal. Based on equivalent umami concentration (EUC) and its TAV, the meat tasted best at 6-8 min. The longer the steaming time, the faster the protein degradation and the more the flavor precursors."
2,"The black carp pickled products (with a weight of 20 g, with the size of 3 cm × 3 cm × 2 cm) is suggested to be steamed for 6 to 8 min. This conclusion provides a theoretical basis for its better taste quality. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."
0,"A 2 × 3 factorial study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary lipid level on the expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes involved in electron transport chain in all-female rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Three practical diets with a fixed crude protein content of 40%, formulated to contain 10% (40/10), 20% (40/20) and 30% (40/30) dietary lipid, were fed to apparent satiety to triplicate groups of either low-feed efficient (F120; 217.66 ± 2.24 g initial average mass) or high-feed efficient (F136; 205.47 ± 1.27 g) full-sib families of fish, twice per day, for 90 days. At the end of the experiment, the results showed that there is an interactive effect of the dietary lipid levels and the phenotypic feed efficiency (growth rate and feed efficiency) on the expression of the mitochondrial genes nd1 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1), cytb (Cytochrome b), cox1 (Cytochrome c oxidase subunits 1), cox2 (Cytochrome c oxidase subunits 2) and atp6 (ATP synthase subunit 6) and nuclear genes ucp2α (uncoupling proteins 2 alpha), ucp2β (uncoupling proteins 2 beta), pparα (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha), pparβ (peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor beta) and ppargc1α (proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha) in fish liver, intestine and muscle, except on ppargc1α in the muscle which was affected by the diet and the family separately. Also, the results revealed that the expression of mitochondrial genes is associated with that of nuclear genes involved in electron transport chain in fish liver, intestine and muscle. Furthermore, this work showed that the expression of mitochondrial genes parallels with the expression of genes encoding uncoupling proteins (UCP) in the liver and the intestine of rainbow trout. This study for the first time presents the molecular basis of the effects of dietary lipid level on mitochondrial and nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial electron transport chain in fish. "
0,"Skeletal muscle growth is regulated by both positive and negative factors, such as myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and myostatin (MSTN), and involves both hyperplasia and hypertrophy. In the present study, morphological changes during muscle development in Megalobrama amblycephala were characterized and gene expression levels were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis in juvenile [60, 90, 120, and 180 days post-hatching (dph)] and adult fish. Our results show that during muscle development, the frequency of muscle fibers with a diameter <20 μm dramatically decreased in both red and white muscles, with a concomitant increase in the frequency of >30 μm fibers in red muscle and >50 μm fibers in white muscle. At 90-120 dph, the ratio of hyperplastic to hypertrophic areas in red and white muscles increased, but later decreased at 120-180 dph. The effect of hypertrophy was significantly larger than hyperplasia during these phases. qRT-PCR indicated MRF and MSTN (MSTNa and MSTNb) genes had similar expression patterns that peaked at 120 dph, with the exception of MSTNa. This new information on the molecular regulation of muscle growth and rapid growth phases will be of value to the cultivation of M. amblycephala. "
0,"Se, an essential biological trace element, is required for fish growth. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Protein deposition in muscle is an important determinant for fish growth. This study was conducted on juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to explore the nutritional effects of Se on protein deposition in fish muscle by analysing the postprandial dynamics of both protein synthesis and protein degradation. Trout were fed a basal diet supplemented with or without 4 mg/kg Se (as Se yeast), which has been previously demonstrated as the optimal supplemental level for rainbow trout growth. After 6 weeks of feeding, dietary Se supplementation exerted no influence on fish feed intake, whereas it increased fish growth rate, feed efficiency, protein retention rate and muscle protein content. Results of postprandial dynamics (within 24 h after feeding) of protein synthesis and degradation in trout muscle showed that dietary Se supplementation led to a persistently hyperactivated target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway and the suppressive expression of numerous genes related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome system after the feeding. However, the ubiquitinated proteins and microtubule-associated light chain 3B (LC3)-II:LC3-I ratio, biomarkers for ubiquitination and autophagy activities, respectively, exhibited no significant differences among the fish fed different experimental diets throughout the whole postprandial period. Overall, this study demonstrated a promoting effect of nutritional level of dietary Se on protein deposition in fish muscle by accelerating postprandial protein synthesis. These results provide important insights about the regulatory role of dietary Se in fish growth."
0,"Heme oxygenase (HO)-1, a rate-limiting enzyme in heme catabolism, results in the formation of equivalent amounts of biliverdin (BV), carbon monoxide (CO) and ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>). Previous studies have revealed that HO-1 plays an important role in immune responses. However, the mechanism underlying the immune responses against bacterial infection of teleost HO-1 remains enigmatic. To decipher the mechanisms, we have cloned and characterized the HO-1 gene of grass carp (designated as GcHO-1) in this research. The results showed that the open reading frame (ORF) of GcHO-1 was 819 bp, which encoded a putative protein of 272 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence phylogenetically shared the highest identity with other teleosts, and contained two domains of heme-oxygenase and a single-pass transmembrane domain. The mRNA expressions of GcHO-1 in healthy grass carp have widely existed in examined tissues in the following order of spleen > head-kidney > middle head-kidney > intestines > liver > gills > heart > muscle > brain. Besides, the mRNA and protein transcription of GcHO-1 were both significantly up-regulated in the liver and head-kidney tissues after Staphylococcus aureus and Aeromonas hydrophila infection. In addition, overexpression of GcHO-1 in kidney cell line (CIK) cells of grass carp could reduce the expression of inﬂammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8, TNFα, CCL1 and IL-6). Herein, we demonstrate that GcHO-1 plays an anti-inflammatory role in innate immunity. Our results shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the antibacterial immunity of teleost."
0,"New protein sources in fish feed require the assessment of the carry-over potential of contaminants and anti-nutrients from feed ingredients into the fish, and the assessment of possible health risks for consumers. Presently, plant materials including wheat and legumes make up the largest part of aquafeeds, so evaluation of the transfer capabilities of typical toxic metabolites from plant-infesting fungi and of vegetable phytoestrogens into fish products is of great importance. With the aim of facilitating surveillance of relevant mycotoxins and isoflavones, we have developed and validated a multi-analyte LC-HRMS/MS method that can be used to ensure compliance to set maximum levels in feed and fish. The method performance characteristics were determined, showing high specificity for all 25 targeted analytes, which included 19 mycotoxins and three isoflavones and their corresponding aglycons with sufficient to excellent sensitivities and uniform analytical linearity in different matrices. Depending on the availability of matching stable isotope-labelled derivates or similar-structure homologues, calibration curves were generated either by using internal standards or by matrix-matched external standards. Precision and recovery data were in the accepted range, although they varied between the different analytes. This new method was considered as fit-for-purpose and applied for the analysis of customised fish feed containing wheat gluten, soy, or pea protein concentrate as well as salmon and zebrafish fed on diets with these ingredients for a period of up to eight weeks. Only mycotoxin enniatin B, at a level near the limit of detection, and low levels of isoflavones were detected in the feed, demonstrating the effectiveness of maximum level recommendations and modern feed processing technologies in the Norwegian aquaculture industry. Consequently, carry-over into fish muscle was not observed, confirming that fillets from plant-fed salmon were safe for human consumption."
0,"Aluminium is a major pollutant due to its constant disposal in aquatic environments through anthropogenic activities. The physiological effects of this metal in fish are still scarce in the literature. This study investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of aluminium sulfate on the activity of enzymes from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus): brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE), muscle cholinesterases (AChE-like and BChE-like activities), pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin and amylase. Fish were in vivo exposed during 14days when the following experimental groups were assayed: control group (CG), exposure to Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> at 1μg·mL<sup>-1</sup> (G1) and 3μg·mL<sup>-1</sup> (G3) (concentrations compatible with the use of aluminium sulfate as coagulant in water treatment). In vitro exposure was performed using animals of CG treatment. Both in vivo and in vitro exposure increased cholinesterase activity in relation to controls. The highest cholinesterase activity was observed for muscle BChE-like enzyme in G3. In contrast, the digestive enzymes showed decreased activity in both in vivo and in vitro exposures. The highest inhibitory effect was observed for pepsin activity. The inhibition of serine proteases was also quantitatively analyzed in zymograms using pixel optical densitometry as area under the peaks (AUP) and integrated density (ID). These results suggest that the inhibition of digestive enzymes in combination with activation of cholinesterases in O. niloticus is a set of biochemical effects that evidence the presence of aluminium in the aquatic environment. Moreover, these enzymatic alterations may support further studies on physiological changes in this species with implications for its neurological and digestive metabolisms."
0,"The evolutionary adaptations of functional genes to life at high pressures are not well understood. To elucidate the mechanisms of protein adaptation to high pressures, we isolated two muscle protein-encoding cDNAs, alpha-actin and myosin heavy chain (MyHC), derived from skeletal muscles of two deep-sea fishes, Coryphaenoides yaquinae and C. armatus, and two non-deep-sea fishes, C. acrolepis and C. cinereus. The alpha-actins from two deep-sea fishes have three amino acid substitutions in comparison to those of non-deep-sea fishes. These substitutions enable the deep-sea fish actins to function even at 60 MPa. The MyHCs of the two deep-sea fishes have a proline residue in the loop-1 region and have a shorter loop-2 region than the non-deep-sea fishes. Additionally, the MyHCs of deep-sea fishes have biased amino acid substitutions at core positions within the coiled-coil structure of the rod region. The roles of these substitutions in the deep-sea fishes MyHCs, however, remain unclear."
0,"This paper presents the results of mercury fractionation in muscle samples of dourada (Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii) from the JIRAU Hydroelectric Power Plant in the Madeira River Basin in the Amazon region of Brazil. The proteome of the dourada muscle was separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE). The mercury present in the protein spots was determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) after acid mineralisation in an ultrasound bath. The protein spots in which the presence of mercury was detected were characterised by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) after tryptic digestion. The GFAAS determinations indicated that 65% of the mercury was linked to the protein fraction with a molar mass (Mm) of less than 90 kDa. The mercury concentrations in the seven spots in which this protein fraction was present were in the range of 11.40-35.10 μg kg(-1). Based on the mercury concentrations, it was possible to estimate that the protein spots contained approximately 1-3 mercury atoms per protein molecule. The ESI-MS/MS analysis allowed characterisation of the seven protein spots as the following proteins: protein NLRC5 (molar mass=18.10, pI=6.30); 39S ribosomal protein L36 mitochondrial (molar mass=15.40, pI=8.23); N-alpha-acetyltransferase 20 (Mm=15.95, pI=8.80); Mth938 domain-containing protein (Mm=15.01, pI=9.60); ubiquitin-40S ribosomal protein S27a (Mm=9.80, pI=7.60); parvalbumin alpha (Mm=12.40, pI=3.80) and parvalbumin beta (Mm=13.10, pI=3.45)."
0,"The liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide-2 (LEAP-2) is an important component of the innate immune defense system and plays an important role in resisting the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, LEAP-2 from golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) was characterized and its expression in response to Photobacterium damselae was investigated. The full-length LEAP-2 cDNA was 1758 bp, which comprised a 5'-UTR of 250 bp, an ORF of 321 bp, and a 3'-UTR of 1187 bp, encoding 106 amino acids. LEAP-2 consisted of a conserved saposin B domain and four conserved cysteines that formed two pairs of disulphide bonds. The genomic organization of LEAP-2 was also determined and shown to consisted of three introns and two exons. The predicted promoter region of ToLEAP-2 contained several putative transcription factor binding sites. Quantitative real-time (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that LEAP-2 was ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues, with higher mRNA levels observed in the muscle, liver, spleen, and kidney. After P. damselae stimulation, the expression level of LEAP-2 mRNA was significantly upregulated in various tissues of golden pompano. In addition, SDS-PAGE showed that the molecular mass of recombinant LEAP-2 expressed in pET-32a was approximately 23 kDa. The purified recombinant protein showed antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Luciferase reporters were constructed for five deletion fragments of different lengths from the promoter region (-1575 bp to +251 bp), and the results showed that L3 (-659 bp to +251 bp) presented the highest activity, and it was therefore defined as the core region of the LEAP-2 promoter. The seven predicted transcription factor binding sites were deleted by using PCR technology, and the results showed that the mutation of the USF transcription factor binding site caused the activity to significantly decrease. The results indicate that golden pompano LEAP-2 potentially exhibits antimicrobial effects in fish innate immunity."
0,"The pikeperch Sander lucioperca is an economically important freshwater species that is currently threatened by higher summer temperatures caused by global warming. To clarify the physiological state of pikeperch reared under relatively high temperatures and to acquire valuable biomarkers to monitor heat stress in this species, 100 fish were subjected to five different temperature treatments, ranging from 23 °C (control) to 36 °C. The physiological and biochemical indexes of liver and blood were determined, and heat-shock cognate 70 kDa protein (Hsc70) mRNA expression profiles were analyzed. The results showed that the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in heat-stressed pikeperch first increased and then decreased, exhibiting peaks at 34 °C, 28 °C, and 28 °C, respectively. The level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in all experimental groups was significantly higher than that of the control. The numbers of red blood cells, the packed-cell volume, and the contents of hemoglobin were significantly higher in the 34 °C and 36 °C treatment groups. Under heat stress, the albumin, cholesterol, and triglycerides contents decreased with increasing temperatures. Real-time fluorescence-based quantitative RT-PCR showed that Hsc70 mRNA levels increased in all eight of the tested tissues under heat stress. Expression reached maximum levels at 34 °C in the muscle, heart and gill tissues, and at 36 °C in the other five tissues. These results demonstrate that several physiological and biochemical phenotypes, such as oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes and molecular chaperones, could be important biomarkers of heat stress in pikeperch, and are potentially valuable to uncover the mechanisms of heat-stress responses in fish."
0,"Myostatin, also known as growth differentiation factor 8, has been identified as a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. The purpose of this study was to characterize and predict function of the myostatin gene of the African catfish (Cg-MSTN). Expression of Cg-MSTN was determined at three growth stages to establish the relationship between the levels of MSTN transcript and skeletal muscle growth. The partial cDNA sequence of Cg-MSTN was cloned by using published information from its congener walking catfish (Cm-MSTN). The Cg-MSTN was 1194 bp in length encoding a protein of 397 amino acids. The deduced MSTN sequence exhibited key functional sites similar to those of other members of the TGF-β superfamily, especially, the proteolytic processing site (RXXR motif) and nine conserved cysteines at the C-terminal. Expression of MSTN appeared to be correlated with muscle development and growth of African catfish. Protein bioinformatics revealed that the primary sequence of Cg-MSTN shared 98 % sequence identity with that of walking catfish Cm-MSTN with only two different residues, [Formula: see text]. and [Formula: see text]. The proposed model of Cg-MSTN revealed the key point mutation [Formula: see text] causing a 7.35 Å shorter distance between the N- and C-lobes and an approximately 11° narrow angle than those of Cm-MSTN. The substitution of a proline residue near the proteolytic processing site which altered the structure of myostatin may play a critical role in reducing proteolytic activity of this protein in African catfish.

0,"Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is a key element for maintaining acid base balance in fish. In our present experiment, novel CA isozymes were identified from the pear puffer (Takifugu vermicularis). Based on the high homology of two predicted CA sequences of the tiger puffer (Takifugu rubripes), a 1715bp novel cDNA was obtained from T. vermicularis. The open reading frame showed a complete coding sequence of 552bp with a deduced peptide sequence of 183 amino acids that exhibited highest (97%) identity with pufferfish putative CA III and CA IV-like sequences. In addition, this translated protein sequence showed 36-37% identity with zebrafish CA IV-like, CA XVa, CA XVb, and CA XVc proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the pufferfish novel protein (pCAn) was a membrane-bound CA protein. Alignment of multiple CA sequences illustrated that most of the putative active site residues of the pCAn isozyme were situated at highly conserved regions of the CA sequences. Examination of motif distribution suggested that the pCAn isozyme was very similar to the puffer predicted CA IV-like isozyme. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed highly differential expression in the brain, gills, kidney, and muscle, whereas CA mRNA expression was almost absent in heart, liver, and intestine. Quantitative PCR expression of CA mRNA abundance suggested several-fold higher expression of pCAn isozymes in the gills compared to other tissues tested. Our results suggest that the pCAn isozyme might be related to CA IV-like isozymes. Further functional studies are needed to investigate the function of the pCAn isozyme in T. vermicularis. "
0,"Training at sustainable swimming speeds can produce changes in fish skeletal muscle that are important for aquaculture due to their growth-potentiating effects. Such changes may be even more relevant when fish are fed diets containing an increasing proportion of carbohydrates as an energy source. We evaluated the effects of moderate-intensity sustained swimming on the transcriptomic response of red and white muscle in rainbow trout fed a carbohydrate-rich diet using microarray and qPCR. Analysis of the red and white muscle transcriptome in resting or swimming (1.3 body lengths/s) fish for 30days revealed significant changes in the expression of a large number of genes (395 and 597, respectively), with a total of 218 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common for both muscles. A large number of the genes involved in glucose use and energy generation, contraction, development, synthesis and catabolism of proteins were up-regulated in red and white muscle. Additionally, DEGs in both muscles were involved in processes of defense response and apoptosis. Skeletal muscle contraction activates a transcriptional program required for the successful adaptation of both muscles to the changing demands imposed by swimming conditions. Future studies should further clarify the mechanisms involved in the adaptation of both tissues to exercise and assess possible benefits of such conditions for cultured fish. "
0,"BCA2, as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is an important anti-virus immune factor in mammals. Up to date, there are not any related reports on BCA2 protein in fishes yet. In the present investigation, BCA2 in large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea (named as LcBCA2) was identified and characterized. The full-length cDNA of LcBCA2 was 1571 bp, including an ORF of 888 bp encoding a polypeptide of 295 amino acids. The putative LcBCA2 protein contained a RING-H2 motif at C terminal. The LcBCA2 transcripts were broadly distributed in all detected tissues, with high expression in muscle, moderate in blood, skin, heart, liver and spleen, weak in other tissue as indicated by qPCR analysis. Significant increases were observed in skin, gill and spleen after infection of Cryptocaryon irritans, and in spleen and head-kidney after inactivated Vibrio. parahaemolyticus, LPS and Poly I:C stimulations. Tissue localization by in-situ hybridization showed that LcBCA2 mainly expressed in the spleen of the fish in the test group. Our findings showed that LcBCA2 inclined to sharply increase in immune organs, especially in head-kidney after bacterial and viral stimulations, while in locations (skin and gill) of parasites infections, suggesting that BCA2 may play an important role in fish defense against bacteria, virus and parasites infections, but the immune mechanisms is are different."
0,"Taurine is indispensable in aquatic diets that are based solely on plant protein, and it promotes growth of many fish species. However, the physiological and metabolome effects of taurine on fish have not been well described. In this study, <sup>1</sup>H NMR-based metabolomics approaches were applied to investigate the metabolite variations in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis nilotictus) muscle in order to visualize the metabolic trajectory and reveal the possible mechanisms of metabolic effects of dietary taurine supplementation on tilapia growth. After extraction using aqueous and organic solvents, 19 taurine-induced metabolic changes were evaluated in our study. The metabolic changes were characterized by differences in carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid, and nucleotide contents. The results indicate that taurine supplementation could significantly regulate the physiological state of fish and promote growth and development. These results provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of dietary taurine supplementation in fish feeding. <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy, coupled with multivariate pattern recognition technologies, is an efficient and useful tool to map the fish metabolome and identify metabolic responses to different dietary nutrients in aquaculture."
0,"Cortisol is a critical neuroendocrine regulator of the stress response in fish. Cortisol practically affects all tissues by interacting with an intracellular receptor and modulating target gene expression. However, cortisol also interacts with components of the plasma membrane in a nongenomic process that activates rapid signaling. Until now, the implication of this novel cortisol signaling for the global transcriptional response has not been explored. In the present work, we evaluated the effects of the membrane-initiated actions of cortisol on the in vivo transcriptome of rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) skeletal muscle. RNA-Seq analyses were performed to examine the transcriptomic changes in rainbow trout stimulated by physiological concentrations of cortisol and cortisol coupled with bovine serum albumin (cortisol-BSA), a membrane-impermeable analog of cortisol. A total of 660 million paired-ends reads were generated. Reads mapped onto the reference genome revealed that 1,737; 897; and 1,012 transcripts were differentially expressed after 1, 3, and 9 h of cortisol-BSA treatment, respectively. Gene Ontology analysis showed that this novel action of cortisol modulates several biological processes, such as mRNA processing, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes, and transcription regulation. In addition, a KEGG analysis revealed that focal adhesion was the main signaling pathway that was upregulated at all the times tested. Taking these results together, we propose that the membrane-initiated cortisol action contributes significantly in the regulation of stress-mediated gene expression."
0,"Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are mitochondrial anion carrier proteins, which play important roles in several physiological processes, including thermogenesis, reactive oxygen species generation, growth, lipid metabolism and insulin secretion. Although the roles of UCPs are well understood in mammals, little is known in fish. To investigate the thermogenesis roles in Chinese perch (Siniperca chuatsi), we cloned the UCP1, 2 and 3. The UCP1 consisted of six exons and five introns, and the UCP2 consisted of eight exons and seven introns. The UCP1 was primarily expressed in liver, UCP2 was ubiquitously expressed, and UCP3 was primarily expressed in muscle. The mRNA levels of UCP1 and UCP2 in liver, and UCP3 in muscle were significantly increased after prolonged cold exposure, but did not change after prolonged heat exposure, suggesting that Chinese perch might have a mechanism of response to cold environment, but not to hot environment. The intestinal UCP1 mRNA level was significantly up-regulated after prolonged heat exposure, while the UCP2 mRNA level was significantly up-regulated after prolonged cold exposure, suggesting that the two paralogs might play different roles in intestine of Chinese perch. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis could shed new light on the evolutionary diversification of UCP gene family. "
0,"In this study, the chronic toxic effects of tributyltin (TBT), an antifouling paints commonly present in surface and ground water, on morphological indices, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and ATPase activity and heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 protein in tissues (liver, gill, and white muscle) of common carp were investigated. Fish were exposed at sublethal concentrations of TBT (75 ng/L, 0.75 μg/L, and 7.5 μg/L) for 60 days. When compared with the control, there was significant lower condition factor in fish exposed at the higher concentration of TBT. ROS levels in three tissues increased significantly at higher TBT concentrations (0.75 and 7.5 μg/L). The hepatic antioxidant enzymes (total antioxidative capacity and superoxide dismutase) activities were induced at higher concentrations (0.75 μg/L) of TBT. When compared with the hepatic antioxidant enzymes activities in fish exposed to 0.75 μg/L of TBT, there was a decreasing trend in those exposed to TBT with a concentration of 7.5 μg/L. However, all the antioxidant enzymes activities were significantly inhibited in gill and muscle of fish exposed to higher TBT concentrations (0.75 and 7.5 μg/L). Moreover, there was significant lower Na-K-ATPase in three tissues after long-term exposure to higher concentration of TBT, but a significant higher Hsp70 protein levels was observed. In short, environmental concentrations of TBT could not induce obvious impacts on fish, but long-term exposure to higher concentrations of TBT could affect seriously the health status of fish. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0,"Ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (ENTPDases) are pivotal regulators of extracellular ATP-mediated purinergic immune signaling. ENTPDase2 is a member of the cell surface-bound ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (ENTPDase) protein family that hydrolyzes extracellular nucleoside 5'-triphosphates and nucleoside 5'-diphosphates. However, the immune relevance of ENTPDase2 in fish has not been elucidated. In the present study, from a comparative immunological perspective, we functionally characterized two ENTPDase2 transcript variants (namely ENTPDase2 and ENTPDase2a) from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Sequence analysis indicates that the deduced Japanese flounder ENTPDase2 and ENTPDase2a proteins possess two conserved transmembrane domains and five apyrase conserved regions that are present in ENTPDase family proteins. However, these proteins only share 54% amino acid sequence identity. Tissue expression analysis revealed that both ENTPDase2 and ENTPDase2a mRNA transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in all examined Japanese flounder tissues, whereas ENTPDase2 is dominantly expressed in blood and ENTPDase2a is abundantly expressed in muscle. Immune challenge experiments showed that ENTPDase2 and ENTPDase2a were significantly upregulated by both inflammatory stimulation and Edwardsiella tarda infection. In addition, the expression of ENTPDase2 and ENTPDase2a was modulated by extracellular ATP (eATP) stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, immunolocalization and functional studies demonstrated that both ENTPDase2 and ENTPDase2a are functional glycosylated plasma membrane proteins. However, ENTPDase2a exhibits greater activity in the hydrolysis of eATP than ENTPDase2 and ENTPDase1 proteins. Finally, knockdown of the ENTPDase2 gene by small interfering RNA significantly upregulated the expression of eATP-induced proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and G-CSF in Japanese flounder head kidney macrophages, while knockdown of ENTPDase2a only upregulated eATP-induced IL-1beta expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that the two functional Japanese flounder ENTPDase2 isoforms play an essential role in the downregulation of eATP-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression in fish by degrading the available ATP levels in the extracellular milieu."
0,"Roundup Original<sup>®</sup> is an herbicide widely used in Mato Grosso's agriculture and it may contamine water bodies, being an unforeseen xenobiotic to aquatic organisms, particularly fish. This study investigated the effects on the hybrid fish jundiara (Leiarius marmoratus×Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum) of an environmentally relevant exposure to this herbicide. Glucose levels in liver, muscle and plasma decreased after exposure to 1.357mgL<sup>-1</sup> of Roundup Original<sup>®</sup> (glyphosate nominal concentration), while glycogen levels reduced in liver and muscle for different times. Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides revealed an adaptive response. Protein and lactate levels also increased during the experiment, however no changes were observed for muscle lactate. Increment of the transaminases suggests damage to the liver cells. After 96hours of exposure, reductions in all hematological parameters were observed, whereas the micronucleus test findings showed genotoxic scenery. Histological analysis did not display pathological alterations of the hepatic tissue. The results obtained provide valuable data for noticing the effects of pollutants on non-target organisms."
0,"The autophagy-lysosome pathway, which involves many crucial genes and proteins, plays crucial roles in the maintenance of intracellular homeostasis by the degradation of damaged components. At present, some of these genes and proteins have been identified but their specific functions are largely unknown. This study was performed to clone and characterize the full-length cDNA sequences of nine key autolysosome-related genes (<i>vps11, vps16, vps18, vps33b, vps41, lamp1, mcoln1, ctsd1</i> and <i>tfeb</i>) from yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco. The expression of these genes and the transcriptional responses to a high-fat diet and fatty acids (FAs) (palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA)) were investigated. The mRNAs of these genes could be detected in heart, liver, muscle, spleen, brain, mesenteric adipose tissue, intestine, kidney and ovary, but varied with the tissues. In the liver, the mRNA levels of the nine autolysosome-related genes were lower in fish fed a high-fat diet than those fed the control, indicating that a high-fat diet inhibited formation of autolysosomes. Palmitic acid (a saturated FA) significantly inhibited the formation of autolysosomes at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h incubation. In contrast, oleic acid (an unsaturated FA) significantly induced the formation of autolysosomes at 12 h, but inhibited them at 24 h. At 48 h, the effects of OA incubation on autolysosomes were OA concentration-dependent in primary hepatocytes of P. fulvidraco. The results of flow cytometry and laser confocal observations confirmed these results. PA and OA incubation also increased intracellular non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h, and influenced mRNA levels of fatty acid binding protein (<i>fabp</i>) and fatty acid transport protein 4 (<i>fatp4</i>) which facilitate FA transport in primary hepatocytes of P. fulvidraco. The present study demonstrated the molecular characterization of the nine autolysosome-related genes and their transcriptional responses to fat and FAs in fish, which provides the basis for further exploring their regulatory mechanism in vertebrates."
0,"High saturated fatty acid (SFA) diets contribute to the development of insulin resistance, whereas fish oil-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) increase the secretion of adiponectin (Ad), an adipocyte-derived protein that stimulates fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and improves skeletal muscle insulin response. We sought to determine whether fish oil could prevent and/or restore high SFA diet-induced impairments in Ad and insulin response in soleus muscle. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed 1) a low-fat control diet (CON group), 2) high-SFA diet (SFA group), or 3) high SFA with n-3 PUFA diet (SFA/n-3 PUFA group). At 4 wk, CON and SFA/n-3 PUFA animals were terminated, and SFA animals were either terminated or fed SFA or SFA/n-3 PUFA for an additional 2 or 4 wk. The effect of diet on Ad-stimulated FAO, insulin-stimulated glucose transport, and expression of Ad, insulin and inflammatory signaling proteins was determined in the soleus muscle. Ad stimulated FAO in CON and 4 wk SFA/n-3 PUFA (+36%, +39%, respectively P ≤ 0.05) only. Insulin increased glucose transport in CON, 4 wk SFA/n-3 PUFA, and 4 wk SFA + 4 wk SFA/n-3 PUFA (+82%, +33%, +25%, respectively P ≤ 0.05); this effect was lost in all other groups. TLR4 expression was increased with 4 wk of SFA feeding (+24%, P ≤ 0.05), and this was prevented in 4 wk SFA/n-3 PUFA. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 expression was increased in SFA and SFA/n-3 PUFA (+33 and +18%, respectively, P ≤ 0.05). Our results demonstrate that fish oil can prevent high SFA diet-induced impairments in both Ad and insulin response in soleus muscle."
0,"Recovery growth is a phase of rapid growth that is triggered by adequate refeeding of animals following a period of weight loss caused by starvation. In this study, to obtain more information on the system-wide integration of recovery growth in muscle, we undertook a time-course analysis of transcript expression in trout subjected to a food deprivation-refeeding sequence. For this purpose complex targets produced from muscle of trout fasted for one month and from muscle of trout fasted for one month and then refed for 4, 7, 11 and 36 days were hybridized to cDNA microarrays containing 9023 clones."
1,"Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) and temporal expression profiling led to the segregation of differentially expressed genes into four major clusters. One cluster comprising 1020 genes with high expression in muscle from fasted animals included a large set of genes involved in protein catabolism. A second cluster that included approximately 550 genes with transient induction 4 to 11 days post-refeeding was dominated by genes involved in transcription, ribosomal biogenesis, translation, chaperone activity, mitochondrial production of ATP and cell division. A third cluster that contained 480 genes that were up-regulated 7 to 36 days post-refeeding was enriched with genes involved in reticulum and Golgi dynamics and with genes indicative of myofiber and muscle remodelling such as genes encoding sarcomeric proteins and matrix compounds. Finally, a fourth cluster of 200 genes overexpressed only in 36-day refed trout muscle contained genes with function in carbohydrate metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. Remarkably, among the genes induced were several transcriptional regulators which might be important for the gene-specific transcriptional adaptations that underlie muscle recovery."
2,"Our study is the first demonstration of a coordinated expression of functionally related genes during muscle recovery growth. Furthermore, the generation of a useful database of novel genes associated with muscle recovery growth will allow further investigations on particular genes, pathways or cellular process involved in muscle growth and regeneration."
0,"Skeletal muscle recovery from disuse atrophy requires the recruitment of insulin signaling for muscle growth, which is driven by protein synthesis. Dietary fish oil, which is rich in long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is known to enhance insulin signaling and protein metabolism. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate whether dietary fish oil facilitates muscle recovery during remobilization after disuse atrophy. Ten days of immobilization, followed by 3 or 13 days of remobilization, were applied to the hindlimbs of rats fed corn oil [corn oil diet group as control (CO)] or fish oil [fish oil diet group (FO)] as source of dietary fat. The immobilization-induced reductions in soleus muscle weight and myosin heavy-chain content were significantly restored by 3 days of remobilization in CO. However, in FO, these muscle recovery measurements did not significantly change until 13 days of remobilization. At 3 days of remobilization, both groups had significant elevations in p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70s6k) activation and at a greater extent in CO than in FO. The activation of Akt was also increased on Day 3, but it was not significant in FO. Throughout the remobilization period, levels of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA were significantly augmented. However, FO had a lesser increase in PGF2α than CO until Day 13. These findings indicate that dietary fish oil inhibits the early stage of soleus muscle recovery after disuse atrophy by suppressing the activation of Akt-p70s6k signaling and PGF2α synthesis."
0,"Post-translational protein deimination is mediated by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), which are calcium dependent enzymes conserved throughout phylogeny with physiological and pathophysiological roles. Protein deimination occurs via the conversion of protein arginine into citrulline, leading to structural and functional changes in target proteins. In a continuous series of early halibut development from 37 to 1050° d, PAD, total deiminated proteins and deiminated histone H3 showed variation in temporal and spatial detection in various organs including yolksac, muscle, skin, liver, brain, eye, spinal cord, chondrocytes, heart, intestines, kidney and pancreas throughout early ontogeny. For the first time in any species, deimination of complement components C3 and C4 is shown in halibut serum, indicating a novel mechanism of complement regulation in immune responses and homeostasis. Proteomic analysis of deiminated target proteins in halibut serum further identified complement components C5, C7, C8 C9 and C1 inhibitor, as well as various other immunogenic, metabolic, cytoskeletal and nuclear proteins. Post-translational deimination may facilitate protein moonlighting, an evolutionary conserved phenomenon, allowing one polypeptide chain to carry out various functions to meet functional requirements for diverse roles in immune defences and tissue remodelling."
0,"Spermatogenesis represents one of the most complicated morphological transformation procedures. During this process, the assembly and maintenance of the flagella and intracellular transport of membrane-bound organelles required KIF3A and KIF3B. Our main goal was to test KIF3A and KIF3B location during spermatogenesis of Boleophthalmus pectinirostris. We cloned complete cDNA of KIF3A/3B from the testis of B. pectinirostris by PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The predicted secondary and tertiary structures of B. pectinirostris KIF3A/3B contained three domains: (a) the head region, (b) the stalk region, and (c) the tail region. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) results revealed that KIF3A and KIF3B mRNA were presented in all the tissues examined, with the highest expression seen in the testis. In situ hybridization (ISH) showed that KIF3A and KIF3B were distributed in the periphery of the nuclear in the spermatocyte and the early spermatid. In the late spermatid and mature sperm, the KIF3A and KIF3B mRNA were gradually gathered to one side where the flagella formed. Immunofluorescence (IF) showed that KIF3A, tubulin, and mitochondria were co-localized in different stages during spermiogenesis in B. pectinirostris. The temporal and spatial expression dynamics of KIF3A/3B indicate that KIF3A and KIF3B might be involved in flagellar assembly and maintenance at the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, these proteins may transport the mitochondria resulting in flagellum formation in B. pectinirostris."
0,"Levels of ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugated proteins, as an index of misfolded or damaged proteins, were measured in notothenioid fishes, with both Antarctic (Trematomus bernacchii, T. pennellii, Pagothenia borchgrevinki) and non-Antarctic (Notothenia angustata, Bovichtus variegatus) distributions, as well as non-notothenioid fish from the Antarctic (Lycodichthys dearborni, Family Zoarcidae) and New Zealand (Bellapiscis medius, Family Tripterygiidae), in an effort to better understand the effect that inhabiting a sub-zero environment has on maintaining the integrity of the cellular protein pool. Overall, levels of Ub-conjugated proteins in cold-adapted Antarctic fishes were significantly higher than New Zealand fishes in gill, liver, heart and spleen tissues suggesting that life at sub-zero temperatures impacts protein homeostasis. The highest tissue levels of ubiquitinated proteins were found in the spleen of all fish. Ub conjugate levels in the New Zealand N. angustata, more closely resembled levels measured in other Antarctic fishes than levels measured in other New Zealand species, likely reflecting their recent shared ancestry with Antarctic notothenioids."
0,"Cancer cachexia is characterised by metabolic alterations leading to loss of adipose tissue and lean body mass and directly compromises physical performance and the quality of life of cancer patients. In a murine cancer cachectic model, the effects of dietary supplementation with a specific combination of high protein, leucine and fish oil on weight loss, muscle function and physical activity were investigated. Male CD2F1 mice, 6-7 weeks old, were divided into body weight-matched groups: (1) control, (2) tumour-bearing, and (3) tumour-bearing receiving experimental diets. Tumours were induced by s.c. inoculation with murine colon adenocarcinoma (C26) cells. Food intake, body mass, tumour size and 24 h-activity were monitored. Then, 20 days after tumour/vehicle inoculation, the animals were killed and muscle function was tested ex vivo. Tumour-bearing mice showed reduced carcass, muscle and fat mass compared with controls. EDL muscle performance and total daily activity were impaired in the tumour-bearing mice. Addition of single nutrients resulted in no or modest effects. However, supplementation of the diet with the all-in combination of high protein, leucine and fish oil significantly reduced loss of carcass, muscle and fat mass (loss in mass 45, 52 and 65% of TB-con, respectively (P<0.02)) and improved muscle performance (loss of max force reduced to 55-64% of TB-con (P<0.05)). Moreover, total daily activity normalised after intervention with the specific nutritional combination (50% of the reduction in activity of TB-con (P<0.05)). In conclusion, a nutritional combination of high protein, leucine and fish oil reduced cachectic symptoms and improved functional performance in cancer cachectic mice. Comparison of the nutritional combination with its individual modules revealed additive effects of the single components provided."
0,"Nearly all the mercury (Hg) in whole muscle from whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and walleye (Sander vitreus) was present as methyl mercury (MeHg). The Hg content in whole muscle from whitefish and walleye was 0.04-0.09 and 0.14-0.81 ppm, respectively. The myofibril fraction contained approximately three-fourths of the Hg in whitefish and walleye whole muscle. The sarcoplasmic protein fraction (e.g., press juice) was the next most abundant source of Hg. Isolated myosin, triacylglycerols, and cellular membranes contained the least Hg. Protein isolates prepared by pH shifting in the presence of citric acid did not decrease Hg levels. Addition of cysteine during washing decreased the Hg content in washed muscle probably through the interaction of the sulfhydryl group in cysteine with MeHg. Primary and secondary lipid oxidation products were lower during 2 °C storage in isolates prepared by pH shifting compared to those of washed or unwashed mince from whole muscle. This was attributed to removing some of the cellular membranes by pH shifting. Washing the mince accelerated lipid peroxide formation but decreased secondary lipid oxidation products compared to that of the unwashed mince. This suggested that there was a lipid hydroperoxide generating system that was active upon dilution of aqueous antioxidants and pro-oxidants."
0,"Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are pattern recognition molecules of the innate immune system via specific recognizing peptidoglycan, a unique component of bacterial cell wall. In the present study, a homologous gene encoding PGRP-S was identified and characterized from Apostichopus japonicus and designated as AjPGRP-S. The open reading frame of AjPGRP-S is 756 bp encoding a polypeptide of 251 amino acids (aa) with a signal peptide (1-24 aa) and a typical PGRP domain (37-178 aa). Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment revealed that AjPGRP-S is a member of the PGRP-S family. In healthy sea cucumbers, AjPGRP-S was expressed in all examined tissues with the highest distribution in body wall, muscle, and intestine. In Vibrio splendidus-infected sea cucumbers, AjPGRP-S was remarkably induced in coelomocytes. The recombinant AjPGRP-S (rAjPGRP-S) was shown to possess the highly amidase activity in the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Moreover, rAjPGRP-S exhibited agglutination abilities and strong bacteriostatic activities against V. splendidus, V. harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus. Furthermore, the agglutination ability can be enhanced in the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>. In conclusion, our results suggested that AjPGRP-S serves as a pattern recognition molecule involved in the immune response towards various pathogenic infections."
0,"RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene-I) is one of the key cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for the recognition of cytosolic viral nucleic acids and the production of type I interferons (IFNs). The full-length cDNA sequence of RIG-I (AjRIG-I) in Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) was identified and characterized in this article. The full-length cDNA of AjRIG-I was 3468 bp, including a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 52 bp, a 3'-UTR of 617 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 2799 bp encoding a polypeptide of 933 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 106.2 kDa. NCBI CDD analysis showed that the AjRIG-I protein had the typical conserved domains, including two adjacent caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), a DEXDc domain, a HELICc domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed a broad expression for AjRIG-I in a wide range of tissues, with the predominant expression in liver, followed by the gills, spleen, kidney, intestine, skin, and the very low expression in muscle and heart. The AjRIG-I expressions in liver, spleen and kidney were significantly induced following injection with LPS, the viral mimic poly I:C, and Aeromonas hydrophila infection. In vitro, the AjRIG-I transcripts of Japanese eel liver cells were significantly enhanced by poly I:C and PGN stimulation, down-regulated with CpG-DNA treatment whereas no change of the expression level was found post LPS challenge. These results collectively suggested AjRIG-I transcripts expression possibly play an important role in fish defense against viral and bacterial infection. "
0,"Contamination of aquatic ecosystems by metals causes various biochemical changes in aquatic organisms, and fish are recognized as indicators of environmental quality. Silver catfish were exposed to six concentrations of zinc (Zn): 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 and 12.5 mg/L for 96 h to determine the mean lethal concentration (LC50). The value obtained was 8.07 mg/L. In a second experiment, fish were exposed to concentrations of 1.0 or 5.0 mg/L Zn and a control for 96 h. Afterward, the tissues were collected for biochemical analysis. Lipid peroxidation, as indicated by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS), decreased in the liver and brain for all Zn concentrations tested, while in the gills TBARS levels increased at 1.0 mg/L and declined at 5.0 mg/L. Zn increased protein carbonyls in the muscle of silver catfish and decreased it in the other tissues. The enzyme superoxide dismutase increased in both exposed groups. However, catalase did not change. Glutathione S-transferase decreased in the liver and increased in the gills (1.0 mg/L), muscle (5.0 mg/L) and brain (1.0 and 5.0 mg/L). Nonprotein thiols changed only in brain and muscle tissue. Zn exposure inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the brain at both concentrations tested, but did not change it in muscle. Exposure to Zn inhibited the activity of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in the gills and intestine at both concentrations tested. Our results demonstrate that Zn alters biochemical parameters in silver catfish and that some parameters such as AChE and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase could be considered as early biomarkers of waterborne Zn toxicity.

0,"During the last few decades, plant protein ingredients such as soya proteins have replaced fishmeal in the diets of aquacultured species. This may affect the requirement and metabolism of methionine as soya contains less methionine compared with fishmeal. To assess whether methionine limitation affects decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine availability and polyamine status, in the present study, juvenile Atlantic salmon were fed a methionine-deficient plant protein-based diet or the same diet supplemented with dl-methionine for 8 weeks. The test diets were compared with a fishmeal-based control diet to assess their effects on the growth performance of fish. Methionine limitation reduced growth and protein accretion, but when fish were fed the dl-methionine-supplemented diet their growth and protein accretion equalled those of fish fed the fishmeal-based control diet. Methionine limitation reduced free methionine concentrations in the plasma and muscle, while those in the liver were not affected. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) concentrations were higher in the liver of fish fed the methionine-deficient diet, while S-adenosylhomocysteine concentrations were not affected. Putrescine concentrations were higher and spermine concentrations were lower in the liver of fish fed the methionine-deficient diet, while the gene expression of SAM decarboxylase (SAMdc) and the rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine synthesis ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was not affected. Polyamine turnover, as assessed by spermine/spermidine acetyltransferase (SSAT) abundance, activity and gene expression, was not affected by treatment. However, the gene expression of the cytokine TNF-α increased in fish fed the methionine-deficient diet, indicative of stressful conditions in the liver. Even though taurine concentrations in the liver were not affected by treatment, methionine and taurine concentrations in muscle decreased due to methionine deficiency. Concomitantly, liver phospholipid and cholesterol concentrations were reduced, while NEFA concentrations were elevated. In conclusion, methionine deficiency did not increase polyamine turnover through depletion of hepatic SAM, as assessed by SSAT activity and abundance. "
0,"Proteolytic activity of viscera extract from hybrid catfish (Clarias macrocephalus × Clarias gariepinus) was studied. The optimal pH and temperature were 9.0 and 50°C, respectively, when toothed ponyfish (Gazza minuta) muscle was used as a substrate. When viscera extract from hybrid catfish was used for the production of protein hydrolysate from toothed ponyfish muscle, extract concentration, reaction time, and fish muscle/buffer ratio affected the hydrolysis and nitrogen recovery (NR) (p<0.05). Optimum conditions for toothed ponyfish muscle hydrolysis were 3.5% hybrid catfish viscera extract, 15 min reaction time and fish muscle/buffer ratio of 1:3 (w/v). High correlation between the degree of hydrolysis (DH) and NR (R(2)=0.974) was observed. Freeze-dried hydrolysate had a high protein content (89.02%, dry weight basis) and it was brownish yellow in colour (L(∗)=63.67, a(∗)=6.33, b(∗)=22.41). The protein hydrolysate contained a high amount of essential amino acids (48.22%) and had arginine and lysine as the dominant amino acids."
0,"The economic and biological significance of blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) makes this species important to explore the underlying molecular mechanism of hypoxia response. In the present study, we compared the transcriptional responses to serious hypoxia in skeletal muscle among hypoxia tolerant (MT), sensitive (MS) and control (without hypoxia treatment, MC) M. amblycephala obtained according to the time difference of losing balance after hypoxia treatment. A total of 88,200,889 clean reads were generated and assembled into 44,493 unigenes. Transcriptomic comparison revealed 463 genes differentially expressed among different groups. A similar hypoxia-induced transcription patterns suggested a common hypoxia response involved in cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, apoptosis, heart contraction and blood circulation. Interesting, four genes, heat shock protein beta-8 (hspb8), cysteine/serine-rich nuclear protein 1 (csrnp1), salt-inducible kinase 1 (sik1), and visinin-like 1a (vsnl1a) were up-regulated in MT Vs MC but down-regulated in MS Vs MC. Additionally, FoxO signaling pathway was significantly enriched only in MT Vs MC. These results not only provided the first insights into the mechanism that muscle tissue coped with the hypoxia stress in cyprinid species, but offered a theory base for breeding of M. amblycephala with hypoxia-resistant traits."
0,"DEAD-box helicase 41 (DDX41) is a key cytosolic DNA sensor playing critical roles in the regulation of type I IFN responses, and their functions have been well-characterized in mammals. However, little information is available regarding the function of fish DDX41. In this study, a DDX41 gene, named On-DDX41, was identified in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. The predicted protein of On-DDX41 contains several structural features known in DDX41, including conserved DEADc and HELICc domains, and a conserved sequence ""Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (D-E-A-D)"". On-DDX41 gene was constitutively expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest expression level observed in liver and muscle, and was inducible after poly(I:C) stimulation. Moreover, the overexpression of On-DDX41 can elicit a strong activation of both zebrafish IFN1 and IFN3 promoter in fish cells treated with poly(dA:dT). The present study thus contributes to a better understanding of the functional properties of DDX41 in fish."
0,"Rainbow trout were reared from 5 g to approximately 400 g on a diet formulated to supply the required protein from either fishmeal or plant proteins. The fish were sampled at every weight doubling and liver and muscle samples were obtained. From these tissue samples RNA and protein were isolated and analyzed for the expression of a number of muscle regulatory and protein degradation genes and enzymatic activity for proteins involved in the caspase, calpain, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways for protein proteolysis. Only MyoD2 showed significant differences in expression between the two diets, while no significant changes over the course of the experiment were determined for MyoD2 or the other muscle factors. For the degradation genes significant changes in expression were determined for calpain1 and calpastatin. Calpastatin also showed a significant increase in expression over the course of the experiment in the muscle of fish fed a fishmeal diet and significant decrease in expression in the liver of fish fed the fishmeal based diet. Differences in proteasome enzyme activity were found between diets in the liver and muscle of fish and for caspase-3 activity in muscle. Significant changes in activity over the course of the experiment were noted for proteasome and calpain activity in the liver and muscle. These findings suggest that diets replacing fishmeal with plant material can have some effects on protein turnover in muscle and that some degradation pathways are differentially regulated during the growth of rainbow trout."
0,"Muscle protein from round scad (Decapterus maruadsi) was hydrolyzed with five commercial proteases, namely, Alcalase, neutral protease, papain, pepsin, and trypsin. Round scad hydrolysate (RSH) prepared with Alcalase demonstrated high antioxidative activity. After ultrafiltration, RSH-III fraction (MW<5kDa) exhibited the strongest activity. Then, RSH-III was purified by gel filtration chromatography (Sephadex G-15) and separated into four fractions (A, B, C, and D), of which fraction B showed the highest antioxidative activity and was further purified using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography twice. The purified peptides were identified as His-Asp-His-Pro-Val-Cys (706.8Da) and His-Glu-Lys-Val-Cys (614.7Da) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Subsequently, the identified peptides were synthesized, and their antioxidative activities were verified. Results indicated that the two novel peptides isolated from round scad muscle protein can be developed into antioxidative ingredients in functional foods. "
0,"The present study aim to investigate the effects of dietary Gelsemium elegans alkaloids supplementation in Megalobrama amblycephala. A basal diet supplemented with 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg G. elegans alkaloids were fed to M. amblycephala for 12 weeks. The study indicated that dietary 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg G. elegans alkaloids supplementation could significantly improve final body weight (FBW), weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) (P < 0.05). The 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg G. elegans alkaloids groups showed significantly higher whole body and muscle crude protein and crude lipid contents compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The amino acid contents in muscle were also significantly increased in 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg groups (P < 0.05). Dietary 40 mg/kg G. elegans alkaloids had a significant effect on the contents of LDH, AST, ALT, ALP, TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, ALB and TP in M. amblycephala (P < 0.05). Fish fed 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg dietary G. elegans alkaloids showed significant increase in complement 3, complement 4 and immunoglobulin M contents. The liver antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and T-AOC) and MDA content significantly increased at 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg G. elegans alkaloids supplement (P < 0.05). The mRNA levels of immune-related genes IL-1β, IL8, TNF-α and IFN-α were significantly up-regulated, whereas TGF-β and IL10 genes were significantly down-regulated in the liver, spleen and head kidney of fish fed dietary supplementation with 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg G. elegans alkaloids. After challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila, significant higher survival rate was observed at 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg G. elegans alkaloids supplement (P < 0.05). Therefore, these results indicated that M. amblycephala fed a diet supplemented with 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg G. elegans alkaloids could significantly promote its growth performance, lipids and amino acids deposition, immune ability and resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila."
0,"Galectins exclusively recognize and bind β-galactoside on cell surface by carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). In spite of extensive study of mammalian galectin importance in immune system, little is known about that of fish. To study the immune response of yellow catfish to pathogens, a tandem-repeat galectin-9 from yellow catfish was identified and named PfGAL9. Its full-length cDNA was 1314 bp, including a 117 bp of 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 951 bp of open reading frame (ORF), and a 246 bp of 3' UTR. The ORF encoded 316 amino acids (35.12 KDa), shared the highest 78% identity with the predicted galectin-9 of Ictalurus punctatus. This protein possessed two distinct CRDs with two highly conserved sugar binding motifs. Quantitative PCR showed that PfGAL9 was lowly expressed in skin, gill, fin, muscle, heart, and intestine, highly expressed in tested immune tissues (head kidney, trunk kidney, liver, spleen, and blood) in normal body. After inactivated Aeromonas hydrophila challenge, PfGAL9 was remarkably increased in head kidney and liver in a time-dependent manner. The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, which not only agglutinated but also bond all examined bacteria. The binding activities are consistent with the size of aggregates formed by agglutinated bacteria. The agglutination must depend on its direct interaction with bacteria. These results suggested that PfGAL9 was involved in the innate immune response against bacterial infection and clearance of pathogens in yellow catfish. "
0,"An 8-week feeding trial and transcriptome analysis were conducted to investigate the potential mechanism of muscle-hardening caused by faba bean in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). Ordinary grass carp (fed with practical diet) and crisp grass carp (fed with faba bean meal) groups were designed. Lower water holding capacity and higher some texture parameters were observed in the muscle of crisp grass carp compared with another group. 19.62 GB clean reads were generated, and total 1354 genes exhibiting differentially expression were identified (FDR < 0.05). Genes function enrichment revealed up-regulated genes in crisp grass carp mainly in response to myofibroblast proliferation, while down-regulated genes in response to immune regulation. Consistent with this, the tight junction pathway and the NF-κB signaling pathway were likewise significantly enriched. In summary, this study identified several candidate genes and putative signaling pathways deserving further investigation to the mechanism of muscle-hardening in fish fed with faba bean."
0,"The great albino northern snakehead Channa argus is habitual to only the Sichuan Jialing Rivers System in China, making its introduction difficult to other riverine systems. Here, we characterized heat shock protein 90 (AcaHSP90) and probed its molecular responses toward the environmental stressors that C. argus can face during its introduction and breeding in the other southern latitudes of China. To serve the purpose, cDNA encoding of AcaHSP90 were cloned and characterized in albino C. argus. The cDNA was 2752bps that contained an open reading frame (ORF), encoding a 726-amino-acid polypeptide of 83.35kDa (theoretical isoelectric point [pI]: 4.89). Genomic DNA analysis showed that the AcaHSP90 gene consisted of 7 introns, five conserved amino acid blocks and other motifs or domains. The AcaHSP90 structure was highly similar with the other known HSP90s except those identified in the bacteria. The expression profiles of AcaHSP90 gene in albino C. argus were also investigated after experimentally exposed to different temperature stresses (8.5, 26 and 37°C) and infected with Edwardsiella tarda (strain NO. DL1476) at different time intervals (0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72h). In addition, the AcaHSP90 expression in different tissues of albino C. argus were also analyzed. The quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis revealed tissue-specific AcaHSP90 expressions in control group, and expressions were significantly stimulated in the brain, heart, kidney, liver, muscle and spleen after the heat shock (37°C), while showed no significant difference after the cold treatment (8.5°C). The mRNA levels of AcaHSP90 were also significantly upregulated in the spleen and muscle at 12h and in the kidney at 12 and 48h post pathogen injections. In a nut shell, these novel results showed tissue-specific responses of AcaHSP90 and indicated that this heat shock protein might also be sensitive to pathogen infection, but closely related to the thermal resistance in albino C. argus."
0,"<i>Pax3</i> and <i>Pax7</i> are members of the <i>Pax</i> gene family which are essential for embryo and organ development. Both genes have been proved to be markers of muscle satellite cells and play key roles in the process of muscle growth and repair. Here, we identified two <i>Pax3</i> genes (<i>SsPax3a</i> and <i>SsPax3b</i>) and two <i>Pax7</i> genes (<i>SsPax7a</i> and <i>SsPax7b</i>) in a marine teleost, black rockfish (<i>Sebastes schlegelii</i>). Our results showed <i>SsPax3</i> and <i>SsPax7</i> marked distinct populations of muscle satellite cells, which originated from the multi-cell stage and somite stage, respectively. In addition, we constructed a muscle injury model to explore the function of these four genes during muscle repair. Hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) of injured muscle sections showed new-formed myofibers occurred at 16 days post-injury (dpi). ISH (in situ hybridization) analysis demonstrated that the expression level of <i>SsPax3a</i> and two <i>SsPax7</i> genes increased gradually during 0-16 dpi and peaked at 16 dpi. Interestingly, <i>SsPax3b</i> showed no significant differences during the injury repair process, indicating that the satellite cells labeled by <i>SsPax3b</i> were not involved in muscle repair. These results imply that the muscle stem cell populations in teleosts are more complicated than in mammals. This lays the foundation for future studies on the molecular mechanism of indeterminant growth and muscle repair of large fish species."
0,"Age-related changes in DNA methylation do occur. Taking advantage of this, mammalian and avian epigenetic clocks have been constructed to predict age. In fish, studies on age-related DNA methylation changes are scarce and no epigenetic clocks have been constructed. However, in fisheries and population dynamics studies there is a need for accurate estimation of age, something that is often impossible for some economically important species with the currently available methods. Here, we used the European sea bass, a marine fish the age of which can be determined with accuracy, to construct a piscine epigenetic clock, the first one in a cold-blooded vertebrate. We used targeted bisulfite sequencing to amplify 48 CpGs from four genes in muscle samples and applied penalized regressions to predict age. We thus developed an age predictor in fish that is highly accurate (0.824) and precise (2.149 years). In juvenile fish, accelerated growth due to elevated temperatures had no effect on age prediction, indicating that the clock is able to predict the chronological age independently of environmentally-driven perturbations. An epigenetic clock developed using muscle samples accurately predicted age in samples of testis but not ovaries, possibly reflecting the reproductive biology of fish. In conclusion, we report the development of the first piscine epigenetic clock, paving the way for similar studies in other species. Piscine epigenetic clocks should be of great utility for fisheries management and conservation purposes, where age determination is of crucial importance."
0,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are important components of non-coding RNAs that participate in diverse life activities by regulating gene expression at the post transcriptional level through base complementary pairing with 3'UTRs of target mRNAs. miR-133b is a member of the miR-133 family, which play important roles in muscle differentiation and tumorigenesis. Recently, miR-133b was reported to affect estrogen synthesis by targeting foxl2 in mouse, while its role in fish reproduction remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we isolated the complete sequence of miR-133b, which was highly expressed in tilapia ovary at 30 and 90 dah (days after hatching) and subsequently decreased at 120 to 150 dah by qPCR. Interestingly, only a few oogonia were remained in the antagomir-133b treated tilapia ovary, while phase I and II oocytes were observed in the ovaries of the control group. Unexpectedly, the expression of foxl2 and cyp19a1a, as well as estradiol levels in serum were increased in the treated group. Furthermore, tagln2, an important factor for oogenesis, was predicted as the target gene of miR-133b, which was confirmed by dual luciferase reporter vector experiments. miR-133b and tagln2 were co-expressed in tilapia ovaries. Taken together, miR-133b may be involved in the early oogenesis of tilapia by regulating tagln2 expression. This study enriches the understanding of miR-133b function during oogenesis and lays a foundation for further study of the regulatory network during oogenesis."
0,"Muscle growth is an energetically demanding process that is reliant on intramuscular fatty acid depots in most fishes. The complex mechanisms regulating this growth and lipid metabolism are of great interest for human health and aquaculture applications. It is well established that the skeletal muscle chalone, myostatin, plays a role in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis in mammals; however, this function has not been fully assessed in fishes. We therefore examined the interaction between dietary lipid levels and myostatin expression in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Five weeks of high-fat diet (HFD; 25 % lipid) intake increased white muscle lipid content and decreased circulating glucose levels and hepatosomatic index when compared to low-fat diet (LFD; 10 % lipid) intake. In addition, HFD intake reduced myostatin-1a and myostatin-1b expression in white muscle and myostatin-1b expression in brain tissue. Characterization of the myostatin-1a, myostatin-1b, and myostatin-2a promoters revealed putative binding sites for a subset of transcription factors associated with lipid metabolism. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD may regulate myostatin expression through cis-regulatory elements sensitive to increased lipid intake. Further, these findings provide a framework for future investigations of mechanisms describing the relationships between myostatin and lipid metabolism in fish. "
0,"The mannose receptor (MR) is a type I transmembrane protein. Its ectodomain has eight C-type lectin-like domains, which are able to recognize and mediate the phagocytosis of a wide range of pathogens. Comprehensive studies have revealed that mammalian MR is widely distributed in the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS, previously known as the reticuloendothelial system) and play a key role both in the physiological clearance and cell activation. Hitherto, neither the MR distribution, nor the function of clearance and cell activation has been investigated in fish. In the previous study, we have reported the full-length cDNA of blunt snout bream MR, analyzed its structure and relative mRNA expression during embryogenesis and in the liver, head kidney, spleen and intestine of fish after stimulation with killed Aeromonas hydrophila. In the present study, we developed a rabbit polyclonal antibody against MR and undertook a systematic survey of the expression of MR at the protein level by immunohistochemistry. To get more information about MR function, the mRNA expression of MR, pro-inflammatory factor TNF-α and anti-inflammatory factor ARG2 genes was measured by qRT-PCR in the liver, head kidney, and spleen after A. hydrophila challenge. We first observed MR expression in the yolk sac at the fertilized egg stage and possibly MR was expressed by early macrophages. We also showed the MR distribution in head kidney, body kidney, spleen, liver, intestine, muscle, brain, heart, and gills. Following A. hydrophila challenge the MR immunoreactive cells became more widespread in head kidney and spleen, which are the major reticuloendothelial systems of fish. The quantitative studies at mRNA levels showed that there exists a high correlation between MR expression and immune cytokine expressions after bacteria challenge."
0,Marine fish meat has been widely used for the extraction of bioactive peptides. This study was aimed to optimize the preparation of monkfish muscle peptides (LPs) using response surface methodology (RSM) and explore the antioxidant activities of <1 kDa LPs.
1,"Peptides were prepared from the muscles of monkfish (<i>Lophius litulon</i>), and five proteases were tested to hydrolyze muscle proteins. The hydrolysate that was treated using neutrase showed the highest degree of hydrolysis (DH) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activities."
2,"The optimized conditions were as follows: water/material ratio of 5.4:1, a time span of 5 h, pH of 7.0, enzyme concentration of 2000 U/g, and temperature of 45 °C; the maximum DPPH scavenging activity and DH were 92.861% and 19.302%, respectively. LPs exhibited appreciable antioxidant activities, including DPPH radical, hydroxyl radical, 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS) radical, and superoxide anion scavenging activities. LPs attenuated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-related oxidative injury in RAW264.7 cells, reduced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) levels."
3,We concluded that LPs could be an ideal source of bioactive peptides from monkfish and also have pharmaceutical potential.
0,"To determine and compare the toxic effects of Iranian heavy crude oil (IHCO) on the embryonic development of two fish species, we examined transcriptome profiles using RNA-seq. The assembled contigs were 66,070 unigenes in olive flounder embryos and 76,498 unigenes in spotted seabass embryos. In the differential gene expression (DEG) profiles, olive flounder embryos showed different up- and down-regulated patterns than spotted seabass embryos in response to fresh IHCO (FIHCO) and weathered IHCO (WIHCO). In this work, we categorized DEG profiles into six pathways: ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and cardiac muscle contraction, validating the expression patterns of 13 DEGs using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of the CYP1A, CYP1B1, and CYP1C1 genes in spotted seabass embryos was higher than in olive flounder embryos, whereas genes related to cell processing, development, and the immune system showed the opposite trend. Orthologous gene cluster analysis showed that olive flounder embryos were sensitive (fold change of genes with cutoff P<0.05) to both FIHCO and WIHCO, but spotted seabass embryos exhibited higher sensitivity to WIHCO than FIHCO, indicating that species-specific differences are likely to be reflected in population levels after oil spills. Overall, our study provides new insight on the different embryonic susceptibilities of two marine fish species to FIHCO and WIHCO and a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms via RNA-seq and DEGs."
0,"The present study investigated the effect of two-step heat treatments on the structure of grass carp myofibrillar proteins (MPs) and their binding ability for selected aldehydes (hexanal, heptanal, octanal and nonanal)."
1,"Within 30 min of the first heating step at 40 °C and 5-10 min of the second heating step at 90 °C, the enhancement of the flavor-binding ability was likely explained by the increases in surface hydrophobicity and total sulfhydryl content due to the unfolding of secondary structures of MPs through exposure of hydrophobic amino acids and sulfhydryl groups. Nevertheless, lengthy heating at 90 °C accelerated the aggregation of unfolded MPs and reduced the hydrophobic bonding sites, thus weakening the hydrophobic interactions and decreasing the resultant binding ability of MPs with aldehydes."
2,The binding ability of aldehydes to MPs was found to be strongly influenced by changes in protein structure and surface during the two-step heating process. The results provided insight into improving the flavor characteristics of freshwater fish surimi products. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.
0,"Responses of redox regulatory system to long-term survival (>18 h) of the catfish Heteropneustes fossilis in air are not yet understood. Lipid and protein oxidation level, oxidant (H2O2) generation, antioxidative status (levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and reductase, ascorbic acid and non-protein sulfhydryl) and activities of respiratory complexes (I, II, III and IV) in mitochondria were investigated in muscle of H. fossilis under air exposure condition (0, 3, 6, 12 and 18 h at 25 °C). The increased levels of both H2O2 and tissue oxidation were observed due to the decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes in muscle under water deprivation condition. However, ascorbic acid and non-protein thiol groups were the highest at 18 h air exposure time. A linear increase in complex II activity with air exposure time and an increase up to 12 h followed by a decrease in activity of complex I at 18 h were observed. Negative correlation was observed for complex III and V activity with exposure time. Critical time to modulate the above parameters was found to be 3 h air exposure. Dehydration induced oxidative stress due to modulation of electron transport chain and redox metabolizing enzymes in muscle of H. fossilis was clearly observed. Possible contribution of redox regulatory system in muscle tissue of the fish for long-term survival in air is elucidated. Results of the present study may be useful to understand the redox metabolism in muscle of fishes those are exposed to air in general and air breathing fishes in particular."
0,"Lactating sows have been shown to develop typical signs of an inflammatory condition in the liver during the transition from pregnancy to lactation. Hepatic inflammation is considered critical due to the induction of an acute phase response and the activation of stress signaling pathways like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR), both of which impair animal's health and performance. Whether ER stress-induced UPR is also activated in the liver of lactating sows and whether dietary fish oil as a source of anti-inflammatory effects n-3 PUFA is able to attenuate hepatic inflammation and ER stress-induced UPR in the liver of sows is currently unknown. Based on this, two experiments with lactating sows were performed. The first experiment revealed that ER stress-induced UPR occurs also in the liver of sows during lactation. This was evident from the up-regulation of a set of genes regulated by the UPR and numerically increased phosphorylation of the ER stress-transducer PERK and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α and IκB. The second experiment showed that fish oil inhibits ER stress-induced UPR in the liver of lactating sows. This was demonstrated by decreased mRNA levels of a number of UPR-regulated genes and reduced phosphorylation of PERK and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α and IκB in the liver of the fish oil group. The mRNA levels of various nuclear factor-κB-regulated genes encoding inflammatory mediators and acute phase proteins in the liver of lactating sows were also reduced in the fish oil group. In line with this, the plasma levels of acute phase proteins were reduced in the fish oil group, although differences to the control group were not significant. In conclusion, ER stress-induced UPR is present in the liver of lactating sows and fish oil is able to inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways and ER stress-induced UPR in the liver."
0,"Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 12 (Txndc12) belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily, and has roles in redox regulation, defense against oxidative stress, refolding of disulfide-containing proteins, and regulation of transcription factors. In this study, a thioredoxin domain-containing protein 12 was cloned from the marine fish grouper, Epinephelus coioides by RACE PCR, named as Ec-Txndc12. The Ec-Txndc12 encodes 173 amino acid residues with signal peptide in its N-terminal and a thioredoxin (Trx) domain that is homologous with some genes in Mus musculus, Xenopus laveis, etc. Ec-Txndc12 mRNA is predominately expressed in liver, brain and muscle. The expression of Ec-Txndc12 was up-regulated in the liver of grouper challenged with SGIV. In order to elucidate its biological functions, Ec-Txndc12 was recombined and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The rEc-Txndc12 fusion protein was demonstrated to possess the antioxidant activity. The grouper spleen (GS) cells were treated with a high concentration of rEc-Txndc12 (30 μg/ml), which significantly enhanced cells viability under oxidative damage caused by viral infection. These results together indicated that Ec-Txndc12 could function as an important antioxidant in a physiological context, and might be involved in the responses to viral challenge."
0,"In the present study, quadruplicate groups of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were fed plant protein-based diets with increasing arginine inclusions (range 28·8-37·4 g/kg DM) to investigate whether arginine supplementation affects growth and lipid accumulation through an elevated polyamine turnover. Dietary lysine was held at a constant concentration, just below the requirement. All other amino acids were balanced and equal in the diets. Arginine supplementation increased protein and fat accretion, without affecting the hepatosomatic or visceralsomatic indices. Dietary arginine correlated with putrescine in the liver (R 0·78, P= 0·01) and with ornithine in the muscle, liver and plasma (P= 0·0002, 0·003 and 0·0002, respectively). The mRNA of ornithine decarboxylase, the enzyme producing putrescine, was up-regulated in the white adipose tissue of fish fed the high-arginine inclusion compared with those fed the low-arginine diet. Concomitantly, spermidine/spermine-(N1)-acetyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine turnover that consumes acetyl-CoA, showed an increased activity in the liver of fish fed the arginine-supplemented diets. In addition, lower acetyl-CoA concentrations were observed in the liver of fish fed the high-arginine diet, while ATP, which is used in the process of synthesising spermidine and spermine, did not show a similar trend. Gene expression of the rate-limiting enzyme for β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, was up-regulated in the liver of fish fed the high-arginine diet. Taken together, the data support that increased dietary arginine activates polyamine turnover and β-oxidation in the liver of juvenile Atlantic salmon and may act to improve the metabolic status of the fish. "
0,"Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is abundant in marine fish. Formaldehyde synthesis by TMAO demethylation during storage markedly deteriorates fish meat. In the present work, we cloned the extremely aspartic acid-rich proteins from skeletal muscle of a commercially important species, walleye pollack, in the course of molecular identification of trimethylamine-N-oxide demethylase (TMAOase). One of the cDNAs, designated as aspolin1, encodes an extremely aspartic acid-rich protein of 228 amino acids which is converted to the TMAOase after processing between Ala42 and Asp43. Mature aspolin1/TMAOase protein contains 179 Asp in 186 total amino acids. The other cDNA, designated as aspolin2, has a common nucleotide sequence with aspolin1 in the 5' part and encodes a protein which has an additional Asp polymer and a C-terminal cysteine-rich region. The amino acid sequence of the C-terminal cysteine-rich region of aspolin2 is highly homologous to the mammalian histidine-rich Ca2+-binding protein. Aspolin1/TMAOase and aspolin2 mRNA was most abundant in the skeletal muscle. A lower level of the mRNA was also detected in kidney, heart, spleen, and brain. Synthetic Asp polymer showed marked TMAOase activity in the presence of Fe2+, whereas a monomer and oligomers did not. Purified TMAOase protein bound to Fe2+ with low affinity, which may be responsible for the catalytic activity. Poly aspartic acid-Fe2+ complex generated after death would be involved in formaldehyde synthesis by the demethylation of TMAO during the storage of fish meat."
0,"Activin receptor type IIA (ActRIIA), a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor is an important regulator of physiological traits, viz., reproduction and body growth in vertebrates including teleosts. However, existing knowledge of its role in regulating fish physiology is limited. To address this, we have cloned and characterized the ActRIIA cDNA of Labeo rohita (rohu), an economically important fish species of the Indian subcontinent. Comparative expression profiling of the receptor gene at various reproductive and growth stages supports to its role in promoting oocyte maturation, spermatogenesis and skeletal muscle development via interaction with multiple ligands of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family. The full-length cDNA of rohu ActRIIA was found to be of 1587bp length encoding 528 amino acids. The three-dimensional structure of the intracellular kinase domain of rohu ActRIIA has also been predicted. Phylogenetic relationship studies showed that the gene is evolutionarily conserved across the vertebrate lineage implicating that the functioning of the receptor is more or less similar in vertebrates. Taken together, these findings could be an initial step towards the use of ActRIIA as a potential candidate gene marker for understanding the complex regulatory mechanism of fish reproduction and growth."
0,"(2S)-3-(2-sulfanylidene-1,3-dihydroimidazol-4-yl)-2-(trimethylazaniumyl)propanoate (ergothioneine, ET) is hydrophilic antioxidant produced only by certain low-level organisms, but has been reported in the organs of some animals upon dietary intake, facilitated by the ergothioneine transporter (ETT). In this study, it was hypothesised that ETT is involved in the uptake of ET from diet in salmonids. The mechanism of ET uptake was evaluated through knockdown of candidate gene encoding ETT in a cell line (RTG-2) from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). ETT gene expression in blood cells and certain tissues from rainbow trout was also investigated as ET from the diet is expected to be carried over to the muscle. Knockdown of an ETT candidate (E1) in RTG-2 cells resulted in a remarkable decrease in E1 mRNA expression; uptake of ET was lower in the knocked group than in the control group suggesting that E1 functions as an ETT for rainbow trout. Furthermore, the expression of ETT gene in different tissues including the muscle points to ET uptake from the diet to the muscle of salmonids. In conclusion, this study partly reveals the possible pathway underlying ET uptake from the diet and its deposition in the muscle of edible fish species."
0,"Osmoregulation plays an important role in the migration process of catadromous fish. The osmoregulatory mechanisms of tropical marbled eel (Anguilla marmorata), a typical catadromous fish, did not gain sufficient attention, especially at the molecular level. In order to enrich the protein database of A. marmorata, a proteomic analysis has been carried out by iTRAQ technique. Among 1937 identified proteins in gill of marbled eel, the expression of 1560 proteins (80 %) was quantified. Compared with the protein expression level in the gill of marbled eel in freshwater (salinity of 0 ‰), 336 proteins were up-regulated and 67 proteins were down-regulated in seawater (salinity of 25 ‰); 33 proteins were up-regulated and 32 proteins were down-regulated in brackish water (salinity of 10 ‰). These up-regulated proteins including Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, V-type proton ATPase, sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter and heat shock protein 90 were enriched in many KEGG-annotated pathways, which are related to different functions of the gill. The up-regulated oxidative phosphorylation and seleno-compound metabolism pathways involve the synthesis and consumption of ATP, which represents extra energy consumption. Another identified pathway is the ribosome pathway in which a large number of up-regulated proteins are involved. It is also more notable that tight junction and cardiac muscle contraction pathways may have correlation with ion transport in gill cells. This is the first report describing the proteome of A. marmorata for acclimating to the change of salinity. These results provide a functional database for migratory fish and point out some possible new interactions on osmoregulation in A. marmorata. "
0,"Immunity can be modulated by different internal and external factors, being stress one of the most important. However, the stress effects on the immunocompetence of the skeletal muscle has not been studied in detail in earlier vertebrates. Here, we examine the effect of chronic (4 and 7 weeks) crowding stress on the immunocompetence of skeletal muscle and head kidney in the fine flounder (Paralichthys adspersus). Corticosteroid receptor transcript levels and their target genes; pro-inflammatory cytokines, and Toll-, NOD-, and RIG-like receptors were quantified by qPCR. The results indicate that chronic stress down-regulates the expression of these genes in muscle, compromising skeletal muscle immunocompetence, while the expression of these genes is upregulated in head kidney after seven weeks of crowding stress. The data suggests that chronic stress modulates the expression of these immune-related genes in a tissue-specific manner."
0,"Excessive dietary intake of Na (i.e., NaCl) contributes to hypertension, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Normally, NaOH and HCl are used to dissolve and precipitate, respectively, fish muscle proteins in isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP), therefore contributing to increased Na content in the recovered fish protein isolates (FPI). Substitution of NaOH with KOH may decrease the Na content in FPI and, thus, allow development of reduced-Na seafood products. In this study, FPI was recovered with ISP using NaOH or KOH. In order to develop a nutraceutical seafood product, the FPI was extracted with NaCl or KCl-based salt substitute and subjected to cold- or heat-gelation. In addition, standard nutraceutical additives (ω-3 fatty acids-rich oil and dietary fiber) along with titanium dioxide (TiO2) were added to FPI. Color, texture, dynamic rheology, Na and K content, and lipid oxidation of the FPI gels were compared to commercial Alaska pollock surimi gels. FPI gels had greater (p < 0.05) whiteness, good color properties (L*a*b*), and generally better textural properties when compared to surimi gels. Although the ISP-recovered FPI and surimi developed similar final gel elasticity, the proteins in FPI and surimi had different gelation pattern. A reduction (p < 0.05) of Na content and simultaneous increase (p < 0.05) in K content of FPI gels was achieved by the substitution of NaOH with KOH during ISP and NaCl with the KCl-based salt substitute during formulation of the FPI paste. Although cooking and addition of NaCl during formulation of the FPI paste increased (p < 0.05) lipid oxidation in FPI gels, TBARS values were much below rancidity levels. These results indicate that KOH can replace NaOH to recover FPI from whole gutted fish for subsequent development of nutraceutical seafood products tailored for reduction of diet-driven cardiovascular disease.

0,"Growth performance in vertebrates is regulated by environmental factors including the quality and quantity of food, which influence growth via endocrine pathways such as the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor somatotropic axis. In several teleost fishes, circulating concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1) correlate positively with growth rate, and it has been proposed that plasma Igf1 levels may serve as an indicator of growth variation for fisheries and aquaculture applications. This study tested whether plasma Igf1 concentrations might serve as an indicator of somatic growth in olive rockfish (Sebastes serranoides), one species among dozens of rockfishes important to commercial and recreational fisheries in the Northern Pacific Ocean. Juvenile olive rockfish were reared under food ration treatments of 1% or 4% wet mass per d for 98 d to experimentally generate variation in growth. Juvenile rockfish in the 4% ration grew 60% more quickly in mass and 22% faster in length than fish in the 1% ration. Plasma Igf1 levels were elevated in rockfish under the 4% ration, and individual Igf1 levels correlated positively with growth rate, as well as with individual variation in hepatic igf1 mRNA levels. Transcripts encoding the Igf binding proteins (Igfbps) igfbp1a and igfbp1b were also at higher abundance in the liver of rockfish in the 1% ration treatment, while mRNAs for igfbp5a and igfbp5b were elevated in the skeletal muscle of 4% ration fish. These findings support the use of plasma Igf1 as a physiological index of growth rate variation in rockfish."
0,"Three serum amyloid A (SAA) genes were identified from the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) by PCR and RT-PCR. Considering both direction and sequence similarity with mammal's orthologs, they were named CcSAA3a, CcSAA3b and CcSAA1. CcSAA3b and CcSAA1 are adjacent on contig LHQP01017858, suggesting that the prototype of or the simplest SAA multigene family have occurred in common carp. A phylogenetic analysis of the SAAs indicated that the fish SAAs were closer to those of invertebrates and Ornithorhynchus anatinus, a primitive mammal, than to mammalian SAAs. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR results displayed different expression profiles of three CcSAAs. The CcSAA3a was detected in all tested tissues, and was most abundant in the muscle; CcSAA3b was predominately expressed in the intestine and liver, and CcSAA1 in the skin. The expression level of CcSAA3a was higher than that of CcSAA3b and CcSAA1 in most tissues. Stimulation with Aeromonas hydrophila dramatically induced the expression of the three CcSAAs in all examined tissues, especially in the liver. Like Epinephelus coioides SAA, all of three rCcSAA fusion proteins could bind to both Gram-negative bacteria (A. hydrophila and E. coli) and Gram-positive bacterium (S. aureus), playing a role in the identification of bacteria. However, only rCcSAA3a showed significantly anti-A. hydrophila and anti-E. coli in vitro antibacterial activity assays. These results suggested that the three CcSAAs were in functional differentiation and play significant roles in the innate immunity of common carp."
0,"Fish is one of the most common elicitors of food-allergic reactions worldwide. These reactions are triggered by the calcium-binding muscle protein β-parvalbumin, which was shown to have reduced immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding capacity upon calcium depletion. This work aimed to reduce gilthead seabream allergenicity using diets supplemented with a calcium chelator. Three experimental feeds were tested, differing in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) supplementation, and its effects on muscle and parvalbumin's IgE-reactivity were analyzed. Chromatographic determination of EDTA showed no accumulation in the muscle and sensory results demonstrated that the lowest concentration did not affect fish quality as edible fish. Proteomics revealed one protein related to muscle contraction with significantly different relative abundance. Immunoblot assays performed with fish-allergic patients sera indicated a 50% reduction in IgE-reactivity upon EDTA presence. These preliminary results provide the basis for the further development of a non-GMO approach to modulate fish allergenicity and improve safety of aquaculture fish."
0,"Fish proteins effect compared with casein was determined on triacylglycerols (TG) metabolism and activities of hepatic triacylglycerol lipase (HTGL) and tissue lipoprotein lipases (LPL), in SHR and diabetic SHR. Two groups of rats (n=24) were fed, 2 months, diet containing 20% casein (CAS) or 20% fish proteins (FP). One month before sacrifice, diabetes was induced in one group of rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (60 mg/kg of body weight). FP vs. CAS showed a significant decrease of TG concentrations in plasma (-41%) and liver (-66%), in SHR-STZ. VLDL-LDL mass, which represented the amount of apolipoproteins, TG, phospholipids (PL), unesterified cholesterol (UC), and cholesteryl esters (CE), decreased by 21 and 16% with FP vs. CAS, in SHR and SHR-STZ, respectively, and was concomitant with its low TG. Indeed, TG values was 1.35- and 1.82-fold lower in SHR and SHR-STZ, respectively. In HDL2, a TG diminution of 13% was noted, in SHR with FP vs. CAS. In SHR-STZ with FP, TG and PL were enhanced by 11% and 27%, respectively compared to SHR. HTGL activity decreased by 22% in SHR fed FP compared to those fed CAS. In SHR-STZ with CAS vsSHR, this activity was decreased by 21%. LPL activity in heart was enhanced by 19% in SHR-STZ vs. SHR with FP, when that of muscle was diminished 1.5-fold in SHR with FP vs. CAS and 1.8-fold in SHR-STZ vs. SHR with CAS. Adipose LPL activity was 1.36-fold higher in SHR with FP than CAS. In conclusion, it appears that fish proteins have a hypotriglyceridemic effect, which the mechanism can differ in SHR or SHR-STZ. It may be of interest to propose these fish proteins as lipid metabolism regulator in diseases with hypertriglyceridemia."
0,"Fish sarcoplasmic proteins (FSP) constitute around 25-30% of the total fish muscle protein. As the FSP are water soluble, FSP were isolated from fresh cod (Gadus morhua) by centrifugation. By SDS-PAGE, it was possible to determine the composition of FSP extracts (FSP-E). The FSP-E undergo denaturation at 44.12 ± 2.34° C, as characterized by differential scanning calorimetry thermograms (DSC). The secondary structure of FSP-E is mainly composed by α-helix structure, as determined by circular dichroism. The cytocompatibility of FSP-E, at concentrations ranging from 5 to 20 mg/mL, was investigated. Concentrations lower than 10 mg/mL have no cytotoxicity cultures of fibroblasts over 72 h. Further on, FSP membranes (FSP-M) were produced by spin coating to evaluate its properties. FSP-M shown having uniform surface as analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The relative amount of α-helix structures is higher when compared with the FSP-E. The FSP-M have higher temperature stability than the FSP-E, since they presented a denaturation temperature of 58.88 ± 3.36° C, according to the DSC analysis. FSP-M shown distinctive mechanical properties, with a stiffness of 16.57 ± 3.95 MPa and a yield strength of 23.85 ± 5.97 MPa. Human lung fibroblasts cell lines (MRC-5) were cultured in direct contact with FSP-M, demonstrating its cytocompatibility for 48 h. Based on these results, FSP can be considered a potential biomaterial recovered from nature, for wound dressing applications."
0,"Child malnutrition is a global public health challenge. A protein malnutrition (PM) model in young mice was established in this study. The efficacy of an ocean-based protein (APP) extracted from by-catch fish as compared to casein and soy on restoring body weight, bone growth, and immunity of PM mice was evaluated. Results show that supplementation of APP increases body weight, lean muscle mass, bone area, mineral content and density. APP supplementation increases spleen, thymus weight, and interlukin-6 production. In conclusion, APP is an alternative source of protein to effectively restore body weight, bone growth and immune function of PM mice."
0,"The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family constitutes of dimeric proteins that regulate the growth, differentiation and metabolism of many cell types, including that of skeletal muscle in mammals. The potential role of TGF-betas in fish muscle growth is not known."
1,"Here we report the molecular characterization, developmental and tissue expression and regulation by nutritional state of a novel TGF-beta gene from a marine fish, the gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata. S. aurata TGF-beta6 is encoded by seven exons 361, 164, 133, 111, 181, 154, and 156 bp in length and is translated into a 420-amino acid peptide. The exons are separated by six introns: >643, 415, 93, 1250, 425 and >287 bp in length. Although the gene organization is most similar to mouse and chicken TGF-beta2, the deduced amino acid sequence represents a novel TGF-beta that is unique to fish that we have named TGF-beta6. The molecule has conserved putative functional residues, including a cleavage motif (RXXR) and nine cysteine residues that are characteristic of TGF-beta. Semi-quantitative analysis of TGF-beta6 expression revealed differential expression in various tissues of adult fish with high levels in skin and muscle, very low levels in liver, and moderate levels in other tissues including brain, eye and pituitary. TGF-beta6 is expressed in larvae on day of hatching and increases as development progresses. A fasting period of five days of juvenile fish resulted in increased levels of TGF-beta6 expression in white skeletal muscle compared to that in fed fish, which was slightly attenuated by one injection of growth hormone."
2,"Our findings provide valuable insights about genomic information and nutritional regulation of TGF-beta6 which will aid the further investigation of the S. aurata TGF-beta6 gene in association with muscle growth. The finding of a novel TGF-beta6 molecule, unique to fish, will contribute to the understanding of the evolution of the TGF-beta family of cytokines in vertebrates."
0,"Parvalbumin, a major fish allergen, has been reported to be highly thermostable. However, little is known as to whether parvalbumin is stable at more than 100°C. Thermostability of the Pacific mackerel parvalbumin was examined by subjecting heated (20-140°C) muscle extracts to SDS-PAGE, western blotting and ELISA. As judged by SDS-PAGE and western blotting with the anti-parvalbumin antiserum recognizing the primary structure, the parvalbumin was not degraded even under severe heating conditions. However, western blotting analysis with the monoclonal antibody recognizing the stereoscopic structure revealed that the parvalbumin undergoes conformational changes in a heating load-dependent manner. Importantly, the IgE reactivity of the parvalbumin determined by ELISA using patient sera was also reduced in a heating load-dependent manner; complete loss of IgE reactivity was induced by heating at 140°C. This study showed that the allergenicity of the Pacific mackerel parvalbumin is considerably less thermostable than assumed for other fish parvalbumins. "
0,"Iron though an essential cofactor for many proteins including haemoglobin and cytochromes, when in excess (>1 ppm in water and 100 ppm in fish tissue) elicits toxicity via Fenton reaction inducing oxidative stress. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of dietary Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) supplementation on waterborne-iron induced oxidative stress in the tissues of Notopterus notopterus. Juvenile fishes were divided randomly into 4 groups, namely, Group-I: control fed with commercial diet only, Group-II, III and IV treated with 0.75 ppm FeCl<sub>3</sub> where Group-II fed with commercial diet only, Group-III with 10% (w/w) Spirulina supplemented commercial diet and Group-IV with 100% (w/w) Spirulina diet only; for 7 and 28 days (n = 6 per group). Tissue oxidative stress biomarkers like lipid peroxidation (LPx), protein carbonylation (PC) and protein thionylation (protein and nonprotein-SH content); antioxidant defence (superoxide dismutase: SOD; catalase; CAT; glutathione peroxidase/reductase: GPx/GR; glutathione s-transferase: GST; metalothionine: MT and reduced glutathione: GSH) and iron accumulation in the gill, liver and muscles tissue were analysed. The augmented oxidative predominance in the tissues with respect to LPx and PC along with decline in antioxidant defence (SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, GST, MT, PSH, NPSH and GSH) by iron was neutralized by Spirulina supplementation in the diet in a dose and duration dependent manner where 100% Spirulina diet for 28 days completely ameliorated iron-induced oxidative stress in fish tissues. Thus, Spirulina can be used as a dietary supplement for fishes cultured in water bodies with iron overload."
0,"Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are calcium dependent enzymes with physiological and pathophysiological roles conserved throughout phylogeny. PADs promote post-translational deimination of protein arginine to citrulline, altering the structure and function of target proteins. Deiminated proteins were detected in the early developmental stages of cod from 11 days post fertilisation to 70 days post hatching. Deiminated proteins were present in mucosal surfaces and in liver, pancreas, spleen, gut, muscle, brain and eye during early cod larval development. Deiminated protein targets identified in skin mucosa included nuclear histones; cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin and beta-actin; metabolic and immune related proteins such as galectin, mannan-binding lectin, toll-like receptor, kininogen, Beta2-microglobulin, aldehyde dehydrogenase, bloodthirsty and preproapolipoprotein A-I. Deiminated histone H3, a marker for anti-pathogenic neutrophil extracellular traps, was particularly elevated in mucosal tissues in immunostimulated cod larvae. PAD-mediated protein deimination may facilitate protein moonlighting, allowing the same protein to exhibit a range of biological functions, in tissue remodelling and mucosal immune defences in teleost ontogeny."
0,"Dioxins have global concerns because of the bioaccumulation tendency and persistency in the environment. Water, seabream Pagrus auratus and seabass Dicentrarchus labrax samples were collected from Abu Qir, Alexandria to evaluate the concentration of dioxin. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) and molecular modeling was applied for elucidating the molecular structure of fish samples. Furthermore, HPLC with UV detection was used to determine the concentration of dioxins (2,8-dichloro dibenzo-p-dioxin). RT-PCR assay was conducted to verify the expression of some immune genes in the fish species as a result of water pollution. The average detected concentrations varied from 0.2 to 1.3μg/l. Gene expression revealed that MHC class 1 and C3 were highly upregulated in liver and muscle of seabass and seabream while T2BP was highly regulated in seabass liver and seabream muscle and seabass muscle for transferrin, FTIR and molecular modeling indicate that dioxin finds its way to fish protein."
0,"The myosin heavy chain gene, MYHM86-2, exhibited restricted expression in slow muscle fibers of torafugu embryos and larvae, suggesting its functional roles for embryonic and larval muscle development. However, the transcriptional mechanisms involved in its expression are still ambiguous. The present study is the first extensive analysis of slow muscle-specific MYHM86-2 promoter in fish for identifying the cis-elements that are crucial for its expression. Combining both transient transfection and transgenic approaches, we demonstrated that the 2614bp 5'-flanking sequences of MYHM86-2 contain a sufficient promoter activity to drive gene expression specific to superficial slow muscle fibers. By cyclopamine treatment, we also demonstrated that the differentiation of such superficial slow muscle fibers depends on hedgehog signaling activity. The deletion analyses defined an upstream fragment necessary for repressing ectopic MYHM86-2 expression in the fast muscle fibers. The transcriptional mechanism that prevents MYHM86-2 expression in the fast muscle fibers is mediated through Sox6 binding elements. We also demonstrated that Sox6 may function as a transcriptional repressor of MYHM86-2 expression. We further discovered that nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) binding elements plays a key role and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) binding elements participate in the transcriptional regulation of MYHM86-2 expression."
0,"The hydrolytic activity of major endogenous proteases, responsible for proteolysis of myofibrillar proteins during post-mortem storage, may be an indicator of the textural quality of fish which influences consumer purchasing behaviour and thus market value of the final product. Furthermore, it may also influence the type and bioactive properties of the peptides released during post-mortem proteolysis of myofibrillar proteins. This study compared the activities of cathepsins B, B+L, D, H and calpain-like enzymes in crude muscle extracted from 16 Australian underutilized fish species. Fish species had a significant effect on the activity of these enzymes with barracouta showing the highest cathepsins B, B+L, D and H activities. Activities of cathepsins B and B+L were higher than cathepsin H for all studied species. The more commercially important rock ling and tiger flathead demonstrated higher cathepsin B+L activity, whereas gemfish and eastern school whiting showed higher activity towards cathepsin B. Underutilized fish species showing higher endogenous protease activities may be suitable for fish sauce production, whereas those with lower protease activities for surimi processing."
0,"The present investigation aims to study role of dietary selenium (Se) on growth performance, oxidative stress markers (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione-s-transferase), stress biomarkers [blood glucose, cortisol and heat shock protein (HSP 70) and immunological status, Nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), total protein, albumin, globulin, A/G ratio, total immunoglobulin and vitamin C] and survival of fish after Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria challenged. Pangasianodon hypophthalmus was treated with lead (Pb, 4 ppm), and high temperature (34 °C) for 60 days. The growth performance was reduced with declined in feed intake, growth rate and feed efficiency in case of group exposed with Pb alone and concurrent exposure to Pb high temperature (34 °C). The Se has immunomodulatory properties however, supplementation of the dietary Se @ 1 and 2 mg/kg diet has been realistically improved growth performance up to 240%, elevated antioxidative status in different tissues, and immunological status were also improved significantly in the P. hypophthalmus. The bacterial challenged with A. veronii biovar sobria in the P. hypophthalmus resulting in less cumulative mortality (%) and high relative (%) survival has been observed with supplementation of dietary Se @ 1 and 2 mg/kg diet. The bioaccumulation of Pb in muscle tissue has been also drastically reduced with supplementation of dietary Se in feed. Hence, overall results indicated that, dietary Se @ 1 and 2 mg/kg have ability to enhanced overall performance and alleviated multiple stresses in P hypophthalmus."
0,"Myoblast fusion is a vital step for skeletal muscle development, growth, and regeneration. Loss of Jamb, Jamc, or Myomaker (Mymk) function impaired myoblast fusion in zebrafish embryos. In addition, mymk mutation hampered fish muscle growth. However, the effect of Jamb and Jamc deficiency on fish muscle growth is not clear. Moreover, whether jamb;jamc and jamb;mymk double mutations have stronger effects on myoblast fusion and muscle growth remains to be investigated. Here, we characterized the muscle development and growth in jamb, jamc, and mymk single and double mutants in zebrafish. We found that although myoblast fusion was compromised in jamb and jamc single or jamb;jamc double mutants, these mutant fish showed no defect in muscle cell fusion during muscle growth. The mutant fish were able to grow into adults that were indistinguishable from the wild-type sibling. In contrast, the jamb;mymk double mutants exhibited a stronger muscle phenotype compared to the jamb and jamc single and double mutants. The jamb;mymk double mutant showed reduced growth and partial lethality, similar to a mymk single mutant. Single fiber analysis of adult skeletal myofibers revealed that jamb, jamc, or jamb;jamc mutants contained mainly multinucleated myofibers, whereas jamb;mymk double mutants contained mostly mononucleated fibers. Significant intramuscular adipocyte infiltration was found in skeletal muscles of the jamb;mymk mutant. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that although Jamb, Jamc, and Mymk are all involved in myoblast fusion during early myogenesis, they have distinct roles in myoblast fusion during muscle growth. While Mymk is essential for myoblast fusion during both muscle development and growth, Jamb and Jamc are dispensable for myoblast fusion during muscle growth."
0,"Plant protein (PP) sources are generally used in high levels in fish diets. Mostly, PP sources are deficient in taurine; hence, there is a need for its supplementation to fish fed high PP diets. Therefore, effects of dietary taurine were examined on growth performance, feed utilization, immunity, and antioxidant parameters of African catfish, Clarias gariepinus (B.). Fish (10.3 ± 0.4 g) were fed on diets (40% crude protein) containing different taurine levels of 0 (control), 10, 20, 30, or 40 g/kg diet for 12 weeks. Fish fed a taurine-free diet (the control) with high PP sources showed poor growth as compared with these fed taurine-enriched diets where taurine stimulatory effects were observed on fish growth and feed intake. Feed conversion ratio and fish survival rate were not significantly differed among different treatments. Fish fed taurine-enriched diets showed also higher levels of serum glucose, cholesterol, total protein, albumin, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, and creatinine over that fed the control diet. Furthermore, lysozyme and respiratory burst activities as well as superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were significantly elevated in fish fed taurine-enriched diets (P < 0.05) and their highest levels were observed in fish fed 30 g/kg diet. Additionally, taurine deposition in fish muscles was positively correlated with dietary taurine levels (P < 0.05). The present study concludes that taurine is a limiting factor for growth, immunity, and antioxidants responses of African catfish fed high PP-based diets and it should be incorporated in its diets with an optimum level of 20 g/kg diet."
0,"The Asian swamp eel (Monopterus albus, Zuiew 1793) is a facultative air-breathing fish with reduced gills. Previous studies have shown that gas exchange seems to occur across the epithelium of the buccopharyngeal cavity, the esophagus and the integument, resulting in substantial diffusion limitations that must be compensated by adaptations in others steps of the O₂ transport system to secure adequate O₂ delivery to the respiring tissues. We therefore investigated O₂ binding properties of whole blood, stripped hemoglobin (Hb), two major isoHb components and the myoglobin (Mb) from M. albus. Whole blood was sampled using indwelling catheters for blood gas analysis and determination of O₂ equilibrium curves. Hb was purified to assess the effects of endogenous allosteric effectors, and Mb was isolated from heart and skeletal muscle to determine its O₂ binding properties. The blood of M. albus has a high O₂ carrying capacity [hematocrit (Hct) of 42.4±4.5%] and binds O₂ with an unusually high affinity (P₅₀=2.8±0.4mmHg at 27°C and pH7.7), correlating with insensitivity of the Hb to the anionic allosteric effectors that normally decrease Hb-O₂ affinity. In addition, Mb is present at high concentrations in both heart and muscle (5.16±0.99 and 1.08±0.19mg ∙ g wet tissue⁻¹, respectively). We suggest that the high Hct and high blood O₂ affinity serve to overcome the low diffusion capacity in the relatively inefficient respiratory surfaces, while high Hct and Mb concentration aid in increasing the O₂ flux from the blood to the muscles."
0,"The early biomarkers for the hematological, serological and histological alterations due to the effect of ½ and ¼ LC<sub>50</sub> of <sup>238</sup>U in different organs in freshwater fish Pangasius sutchi for water-borne <sup>238</sup>U accumulation was investigated. The toxicological data due to <sup>238</sup>U accumulation on the hematological parameters such as hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs) and hematocrit (Hct) to evaluate the oxygen carrying capacity has been indicated as the secondary response of the organisms. The biomarkers of liver damage were determined as by Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT), Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), γ-Glutamyl Transferase (γ-GT). Similarly, the renal biomarkers of kidney damage were accessed by creatinine, uric acid, triglycerides, and cholesterol. The decrease in hemoglobin in the experimental group due to disturbed synthesis of hemoglobin was directly proportional to the concentration and exposure duration of <sup>238</sup>U. The histological studies proved that liver and gills are the target organ for <sup>238</sup>U toxicity. The extensive histological lesions were observed in various tissues due to oxidative stress by the accumulation of <sup>238</sup>U, and the <sup>238</sup>U toxicity in the organs was in the order of Gills<liver<brain<muscle. This study can be useful indicators of <sup>238</sup>U toxicity to assess fish health in Uranium (<sup>238</sup>U) biomonitoring programs."
0,"MAVS (mitochondria antiviral signaling protein) plays an important role in the host cellular innate immune response against microbial pathogens. In this study, MAVS has been cloned and characterized from black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus). The full-length cDNA of black carp MAVS (bcMAVS) consists of 2352 nucleotides and the predicted bcMAVS protein contains 579 amino acids. Structural analysis showed that bcMAVS is composed of functional domains including an N-terminal CARD, a central proline-rich domain, a putative TRAF2-binding motif and a C-terminal TM domain, which is similar to mammalian MAVS. bcMAVS is constitutively transcribed in all the selected tissues including gill, kidney, heart, intestine, liver, muscle, skin and spleen; bcMAVS mRNA level in intestine, liver, muscle increased but decreased in spleen right after GCRV or SVCV infection. Multiple bands of bcMAVS were detected in western blot when it was expressed in tissue culture, which is similar to mammalian MAVS. Immunofluorescence assay determined that bcMAVS is a mitochondria protein and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that bcMAVS could induce zebrafish IFN and EPC IFN expression in tissue culture. Data generated in this manuscript has built a solid foundation for further elucidating the function of bcMAVS in the innate immune system of black carp. "
0,"The role and underlying mechanisms by which n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) prevent/reverse SRD-induced insulin resistance (IR) in the muscle are not completely understood. Therefore, we examined: triglyceride, diacylglycerol, PKCθ, Glut-4, enzymatic hexokinase activity, IRS-1 protein mass level, and fatty acid composition of muscle phospholipids. Rats were fed a SRD during 6 months. Thereafter, half the animals continued with SRD up to 8 months; the other half was fed a SRD in which CO (8% wt/wt) was replaced by FO (7%+1% CO) for 2 months. Results were compared with those obtained in rats fed a control diet (CD). In SRD-fed rats, FO oil normalized/improved lipid storage and PKCθ protein mass level. Effects of insulin were comparable with those of CD-fed rats. FO reversed impaired glucose phosphorylation, IRS-1, and, under insulin stimulation, Glut-4 protein mass level. FO normalized insulin resistance and increased n-3 PUFAs in muscle phospholipids."
0,"Cortisol modulates energy metabolism promoting the mobilization of glucose and increasing proteolysis to overcome stressful situations in teleost. The cortisol metabolic effects are attributed to genomic mechanisms that involve the interaction of cortisol with its glucocorticoid intracellular receptor. Furthermore, cortisol can also interact with plasma membrane glucocorticoid receptors activating a rapid nongenomic signaling; however, its contribution during the early acute phase stress response in fish is unknown. In the present work, we evaluated the effects of membrane-initiated cortisol actions in vivo in the proteome of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) skeletal muscle. Quantitative iTRAQ analyses were performed to examine proteomic changes in rainbow trout stimulated with physiological concentrations of cortisol and cortisol-BSA, a membrane-impermeable cortisol conjugate. A total of 873 proteins were identified, among which 61 and 47 proteins were differentially expressed under cortisol and cortisol-BSA treatments, respectively. Functional clustering analysis revealed an upregulation of proteins associated with mitochondria and oxidative phosphorylation. These results were validated by Western blot analysis. Additionally, using rainbow trout myotubes, the participation of membrane glucocorticoid receptors in gene expression was evaluated. The results obtained suggest that cortisol acts through a membrane canonical glucocorticoid receptor and mediates the expression of proteins associated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation."
0,"In this study, sequence analysis showed that ToGHR1 and ToGHR2 encoded polypeptides of 577 and 588 amino acids, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis showed that both ToGHR1 and ToGHR2 contain FN3 domains and transmembrane domains, which have glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. The exons of ToGHR1 and exons 4-10 of ToGHR2 are homologous to exons 2 and 4-9 in Homo sapiens genes, respectively. Only 3 SSR sites in ToGHR1 have SSR polymorphisms, and ToGHR2 has no SSR polymorphisms. ToGHR1 and ToGHR2 have high homology with GHR1 and GHR2 of many fish by BLAST. qRT-PCR was used to examine the expression profile of ToGHR mRNA in 12 normal liver and intestine tissue samples from 3 feed-type groups. The results showed that ToGHR is expressed in all 12 tissues, especially liver and muscle tissues, which showed higher ToGHR expression than that in other tissues (p < 0.05). Experiments on feed-type groups may indicate that high levels of LC-PUFA in squid bait can promote ToGHR1 expression and simultaneously inhibit ToGHR2 expression in the liver tissue. In addition, the high levels of LC-PUFA in food could inhibit intestinal ToGHR1 expression, and the intermediate levels may promote intestinal ToGHR1 expression. However, the unsaturated fatty acid content in the food does not affect the expression of intestinal ToGHR2."
0,"CC chemokines are the largest subfamily of chemokines, which are important components of the innate immune system. To date, sequences of several CC chemokines have been identified in half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis); however, the activities and functions of these putative chemokines remain unknown. Herein, we characterized a CC chemokine, CsCCL17, from tongue sole, and examined its activity. CsCCL17 contains a 303 bp open reading frame, which encodes a polypeptide of 100 amino acids with a molecular mass of 12 kDa CsCCL17 is phylogenetically related to the CCL17/22 group of CC chemokines and possesses the typical arrangement of four cysteines and an SCCR motif found in known CC chemokines. Under normal physiological conditions, CsCCL17 expression was detected in spleen, liver, heart, gill, head kidney, muscle, brain, and intestine. When the fish were infected by bacterial and viral pathogens, CsCCL17 expression was significantly up-regulated in a time-dependent manner. Chemotactic analysis showed that recombinant CsCCL17 (rCsCCL17) induced migration of peripheral blood leukocytes. A mutagenesis study showed that when the two cysteine residues in the SCCR motif were replaced by serine, no apparent chemotactic activity was observed in the mutant protein rCsCCL17M. rCsCCL17 enhanced the resistance of tongue sole against viral infection, but rCsCCL17M lacked this antiviral effect. Taken together, these findings indicate that CsCCL17 is a functional CC chemokine with the ability to recruit leukocytes and enhance host immune defense in a manner that requires the conserved SCCR motif."
0,"Here we examined the use of stable isotopes, [¹³C]starch and [¹⁵N]protein, as dietary tracers to study carbohydrate assimilation and distribution and protein utilisation, respectively, by rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The capacity of glucose uptake and use by tissues was studied, first, by varying the digestibility of carbohydrate-rich diets (30 % carbohydrate), using raw starch and gelatinised starch (GS) and, second, by observing the effects of two regimens of activity (voluntary swimming, control; sustained swimming at 1·3 body lengths/s, exercise) on the GS diet. Isotopic ratio enrichment (¹³C and ¹⁵N) of the various tissue components (protein, lipid and glycogen) was measured in the liver, muscles, viscera and the rest of the fish at 11 and 24 h after a forced meal. A level of 30 % of digestible carbohydrates in the food exceeded the capacity of rainbow trout to use this nutrient, causing long-lasting hyperglycaemia that raises glucose uptake by tissues, and the synthesis of glycogen and lipid in liver. Total 13C recovered 24 h post-feeding in the GS group was lower than at 11 h, indicating a proportional increase in glucose oxidation, although the deposition of lipids in white muscle (WM) increased. Prolonged hyperglycaemia was prevented by exercise, since sustained swimming enhances the use of dietary carbohydrates, mainly through conversion to lipids in liver and oxidation in muscles, especially in red muscle (RM). Higher recoveries of total 15N for exercised fish at 24 h, mainly into the protein fraction of both RM and WM, provide evidence that sustained swimming improves protein deposition, resulting in an enhancement of the protein-sparing effect."
0,"Fish is one of the eight major foods causing type-I food allergy, and the prevalence of its allergy is increasing in part due to changes in consumption habits. One of the main drivers for these changes has been the processing developments transforming the fish muscle into seafood products. Most fish allergic patients react to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein β-parvalbumin (β-PV) abundant in muscle. Here we have analyzed the effect of processing in the content and allergenic properties of the β-PV. We found that the transformation process decreases the β-PV content (4.7 ± 0.3 mg/g muscle, 0.24 ± 0.03 mg/g surimi, ≤0.003 ± 0.001 mg/g in seafood products), reduces the specific-IgE binding and prevents allergy relevant properties such the protease resistance and amyloid aggregation. These results suggest seafood products as potentially tolerable foods for fish allergic patients, but milk and egg allergic patients should be aware of the presence relevant additives."
0,"Parvalbumins are the most important fish allergens, which are heat-stable, classified in the family of calcium-binding EF-hand proteins, and contain one magnesium binding site. The functional connection between calcium and parvalbumin gives fish the high-speed swimming ability because of high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding parvalbumin in fish white muscles. Although parvalbumins are widely studied and conceivably play crucial roles in the physiology and swimming pattern of fishes, still no report is available about their presence in microbes, such as pathogenic fungal species. We detected a DNA sequence in the genome of <i>Trichophyton violaceum</i> and used <i>in silico</i> and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique with a designed pair of primers to identify it as parvalbumin-coding gene."
0,"An 8-week growth trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary arginine (Arg) levels on growth, gut morphology, oxidation resistance and immunity of hybrid grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus♀×Epinephelus lanceolatus♂) juveniles. Seven isoenergetic (1465 kJ (350 kcal)/100-g DM), isoproteic (53·5 % of DM) and isolipidic (7 % of DM) experimental diets were formulated to contain graded Arg levels ranging from 1·9 to 4·7 % (dry weight) at approximately 0·5 % increments. Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of 16 juvenile fish (average initial body weight: 11·7 (sd 0·1) g) and was administered twice daily (08.00 and 16.00 hours). After the growth trial, all remaining fish were fed their prescribed diets for 2 d and then exposed to 4·5 mg Cu2+/l water for 36 h. Results showed that growth performance and feed utilisation of experimental fish were significantly affected by different dietary Arg levels. Weight gain % (WG%) of fish was increased as dietary Arg increased, reaching a peak value at 3·8 % dietary Arg level, and when dietary Arg level increased to 4·7 % WG% was reduced. Fish fed 1·9 and 2·2 % dietary Arg levels had higher daily feed intake compared with fish fed other dietary Arg levels. Feed conversion ratios in fish fed 1·9, 2·2, 2·7 and 4·7 % dietary Arg levels were higher than those in fish fed 3·1, 3·8 and 4·1 % dietary Arg levels. Protein efficiency ratio and protein productive value (PPV) increased with an increase in dietary Arg, up to a peak value at 3·8 % dietary Arg level, above which these parameters declined. On the basis of quadratic regression analysis of weight gain % (WG%) or PPV against dietary Arg levels, the optimal dietary Arg requirement for hybrid grouper was estimated to be 3·65 %. Fish fed 3·8 % dietary Arg had higher whole-body and muscle protein contents compared with fish fed other dietary Arg levels. Fish fed 3·8 and 4·1 % dietary Arg levels had higher levels of mRNA for insulin-like growth factor-I and target of rapamycin in the liver compared with fish fed other dietary Arg levels. Hepatic S6 kinase 1 mRNA expression in fish fed 3·8 % dietary Arg level was higher than that in fish fed any of the other dietary Arg levels. Gut morphology, hepatic antioxidant indices and immune indices in serum and head kidney were significantly influenced by dietary Arg levels. In conclusion, the optimal dietary Arg requirement for hybrid grouper was estimated to be 3·65 %, and suitable dietary Arg supplementations improved gut morphology and oxidation resistance of hybrid grouper."
0,"RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) detect cytosolic RNA virus components and initiate antiviral innate immune response through downstream signaling in vertebrates. In this paper, LGP2 of black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) has been cloned and characterized, which is a key member of RLR family. The full-length cDNA of black carp LGP2 (bcLGP2) comprises 2941 nucleotides and the predicted bcLGP2 protein contains 682 amino acids. bcLGP2 shares core homologous structural domains of RLRs, including a N-terminnal DExD/H helicase domain, a helicase superfamily c-terminal domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD). bcLGP2 mRNA was constitutively detected in all selected tissues including heart, liver, spleen, kidney, intestine, muscle, skin, gill; and bcLGP2 mRNA level was increased in all the tissues except gill in response to GCRV or SVCV infection. Q-PCR of Mylopharyngodon piceus fin (MPF) cells demonstrated that bcLGP2 transcription was up-regulated by Poly (I:C) treatment, GCRV or SVCV infection, but not by LPS or PMA treatment. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the molecular weight of bcLGP2 was around 80 KDa; and the immunofluorescence staining of both HeLa cells and EPC cells showed that bcLGP2 was a cytosolic protein. EPC cells transfected with plasmid expressing bcLGP2 showed obviously improved antiviral ability against SVCV and GCRV. In general, these data support the conclusion that bcLGP2 functions importantly in the host antiviral innate immune response. "
0,"Ocean warming is known to alter the performance and fitness of marine organisms albeit the proteome underpinnings of species thermal tolerance are still largely unknown. In this 1-month experiment we assessed the vulnerability of the gilt-head sea bream <i>Sparus aurata</i>, taken here as a biological model for some key fisheries species, to ocean warming (control 18°C, nursery ground temperature 24°C and heat wave 30°C). Survival was impaired after 28 days, mainly at 30°C although fishes' condition was unaltered. Muscle proteome modulation was assessed at 14 and 21 days, showing that protein expression profiles were similar between fish exposed to 18 and 24°C, differing from fish exposed to 30°C. Fish subjected to 24°C showed an enhanced glycolytic potential and decreased glycogenolysis mainly at 14 days of exposure. Fish subjected to 30°C also showed enhanced glycolytic potential and up-regulated proteins related to gene expression, cellular stress response (CSR), and homeostasis (mostly cytoskeletal dynamics, acid-base balance, chaperoning). However, inflammatory processes were elicited at 21 days along with a down-regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thus, juvenile fish seem able to acclimate to 24°C but possibly not to 30°C, which is the predicted temperature for estuaries during heat waves by the year 2100. This may be related with increasing constraints on organism physiology associated with metabolic scope available for performance and fitness at higher temperatures. Consequently, recruitment of commercial sea breams may be in jeopardy, highlighting the need for improved management plans for fish stocks."
0,"Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 17 (TXNDC17) is a small protein (∼14 kDa) involved in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis via a thiol-disulfide reductase activity. In this study, TXNDC17 was identified and characterized from Hippocampus abdominalis. The open reading frame (ORF) consisted of 369 bp and 123 amino acids. Similar to the other thioredoxins, TXNDC17 contained a conserved WCXXC functional motif. The highest spatial mRNA expressions of HaTXNDC17 were observed in the muscle, brain, and intestine. Interestingly, the mRNA expression of HaTXNDC17 in blood showed significant upregulation at 48 h against all the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and bacteria. Further, HaTXNDC17 transcripts in the trunk kidney were significantly upregulated at 24-48 h by bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS), viral mimic polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), and gram-negative bacteria (Edwardsiella tarda). The DPPH assay showed that the radical scavenging activity varies in a concentration-dependent manner. The insulin reduction assay demonstrated a significant logarithmic relationship with the concentration of rHaTXNDC17. Moreover, FHM cells treated with recombinant HaTXNDC17 significantly enhanced cellular viability under oxidative stress. Together, these results show that HaTXNDC17 function is important for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and that it is also involved in the immune mechanism in seahorses."
0,"Methylmercury (MeHg) exposure and adverse health effects in fishes have been documented, but the molecular mechanisms involved in toxicity have not been fully characterized. The objectives of the current study were to (1) determine whether total Hg (THg) in the muscle was predictive of MeHg concentrations in the brain of wild female yellow perch (Perca flavescens) collected from four lakes in Kejimkujik National Park, a known biological mercury (Hg) hotspot in Nova Scotia, Canada and (2) to determine whether transcripts involved in the oxidative stress response were altered in abundance in fish collected across five lakes representing a MeHg gradient. In female yellow perch, MeHg in whole brain (0.38 to 2.00μg/g wet weight) was positively associated with THg in muscle (0.18 to 2.13μg/g wet weight) (R<sup>2</sup>=0.61, p<0.01), suggesting that muscle THg may be useful for predicting MeHg concentrations in the brain. Catalase (cat) mRNA levels were significantly lower in brains of perch collected from lakes with high Hg when compared to those individuals from lakes with relatively lower Hg (p=0.02). Other transcripts (cytochrome c oxidase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-s-transferase, heat shock protein 70, protein disulfide isomerase, and superoxide dismutase) did not show differential expression in the brain over the gradient. These findings suggest that MeHg may be inversely associated with catalase mRNA abundance in the central nervous system of wild fishes."
0,"Interleukin-2 receptor subunit beta of flounder (Paralichthys olivace, fIL-2Rβ) was annotated on the NCBI, its gene was cloned and characterized functionally in this study. And then the amino acids sequences and tertiary structure of fIL-2Rβ were analyzed, respectively. RT-PCR and ImageJ analyzed showed that fIL-2Rβ mRNA were expressed in the gill, spleen, kidney, intestines, liver, blood, muscle and skin, which showed high signals in spleen and blood. And then the recombinant protein of fIL-2Rβ extracellular region and its polyclonal antibodies were produced, native fIL-2Rβ molecules in flounder peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were identified at 60.7 kDa by Mass spectrometry, which were in accordance with the molecular mass of full fIL-2Rβ protein calculated on the predicted protein sequence. Then the IL-2Rβ+ cell in T/B lymphocytes were characterized by Flow cytometry and indirect immunofluorescence assay, respectively. The results showed that the percentages of IL-2Rβ+ leukocytes, IL-2Rβ+/CD4+, IL-2Rβ+/IgM+ lymphocytes were 18.4 ± 2.7%, 4.5 ± 0.8%, 4.3% ± 0.5 in PBLs, and were 13.6 ± 0.9%, 4.6 ± 1.1%, 6.1% ± 0.4 in spleen, similarly, the percentages of IL-2Rβ+ leukocytes, IL-2Rβ+/CD4+, IL-2Rβ+/IgM+ lymphocytes were 9.4 ± 0.3%, 4.0 ± 0.5%, 5.7 ± 0.1% in head kidney, respectively. After KLH injection, compared with control group, the gene expression of IL-2, IL-2Rβ, CD3, TCR, CD79b and IgM in spleen of flounder were up-regulated, respectively (p < 0.05). And the FCM results showed that the percentages of IL-2Rβ+ leukocytes in PBLs were significantly increased post Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) injection, which peaked 23.9 ± 0.9% at 9<sup>th</sup> day (p < 0.05). To our knowledge, those results first reported that the characteristics of IL-2R and IL-2R + molecules were expressed on both B and T lymphocytes in fish. At the same time, this study lays a foundation for further exploring the interaction between IL-2 and IL-2R to promote cell proliferation and carrying out biological functions."
0,"The response to tissue damage is a complex process, which involves the coordinated regulation of multiple proteins to ensure tissue repair. In order to investigate the effect of tissue damage in a lower vertebrate, samples were taken from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at day 7 after damage and proteins were separated using 2DE. The experimental design included two groups of rainbow trout, which were fed organic feed either with or without astaxanthin. In total, 96 proteins were found to be affected by tissue damage, clearly demonstrating in this lower vertebrate the complexity and magnitude of the cellular response, in the context of a regenerative process. Using a bioinformatics approach, the main biological function of these proteins were assigned, showing the regulation of proteins involved in processes such as apoptosis, iron homeostasis, and regulation of muscular structure. Interestingly, it was established that exclusively within the astaxanthin feed group, three members of the annexin protein family (annexin IV, V, and VI) were regulated in response to tissue damage."
0,"The functional role of amino acids as regulators of protein degradation was investigated using primary myogenic precursor cell culture as in vitro model of rainbow trout white muscle. Seven-day old myocytes were starved of amino acids for two hours then exposed to media that contained amino acid treatments, during which protein degradation rates were analyzed over five hours by measuring cellular release of <sup>3</sup>H-tyrosine. Increasing concentrations of essential amino acids (EAA) reduced protein degradation rates; this effect was dose-dependent within the physiological range found in plasma. Addition of leucine or phenylalanine at 5 mM and 2.5 mM, respectively, decreased rates of protein degradation compared to media without amino acid supplementation, suggesting that these amino acids directly regulate muscle proteolysis. Protein degradation rates were similar in cells exposed to media without EAA and media lacking only leucine, further supporting a role for leucine as a central regulator of protein turnover. Addition of 5 mM lysine or valine to media without amino acids increased protein degradation; this response was attenuated as EAA were added back into media, supporting that a lysine or valine imbalance is costly for muscle protein retention. In summary, there is evidence for amino acids as both positive and negative regulators of protein turnover in rainbow trout muscle. These findings suggest that there may be an optimal plasma amino acid profile that minimizes protein turnover and that this could be achieved through diet formulation."
0,"Cathepsins are lysosomal cysteine proteases belonging to the papain family, members of which play important roles in normal metabolism for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) cathepsin D (RbCTSD) cDNAs were identified by expressed sequence tag analysis of a lipopolysaccharide-stimulated rock bream liver cDNA library. The full-length RbCTSD cDNA (1644 bp) contained an open reading frame of 1191 bp encoding 396 amino acids. Alignment analysis revealed that the active sites and N-glycosylation sites of the deduced protein were well conserved. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RbCTSD is most closely related to the Mi-iuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy) cathepsin D. RbCTSD was ubiquitously expressed in all the examined tissues, predominantly in muscle and kidneys. RbCTSD mRNA expression was also examined in several tissues under conditions of bacterial and viral challenge. All examined tissues of fish infected with Edwardsiella tarda (E. tarda), Streptococcus iniae (S. iniae), and red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) showed significant increases in RbCTSD expression compared with the control. In the kidney and spleen, RbCTSD mRNA expression was markedly upregulated following infection with all tested pathogens. These findings indicate that RbCTSD plays an important role in the innate immune response of rock bream. Furthermore, these results provide important information for the identification of other cathepsin D genes in various fish species."
0,"A novel sarcomeric myosin heavy chain gene, MYH14, was identified following the completion of the human genome project. MYH14 contains an intronic microRNA, miR-499, which is expressed in a slow/cardiac muscle specific manner along with its host gene; it plays a key role in muscle fiber-type specification in mammals. Interestingly, teleost fish genomes contain multiple MYH14 and miR-499 paralogs. However, the evolutionary history of MYH14 and miR-499 has not been studied in detail. In the present study, we identified MYH14/miR-499 loci on various teleost fish genomes and examined their evolutionary history by sequence and expression analyses."
1,"Synteny and phylogenetic analyses depict the evolutionary history of MYH14/miR-499 loci where teleost specific duplication and several subsequent rounds of species-specific gene loss events took place. Interestingly, miR-499 was not located in the MYH14 introns of certain teleost fish. An MYH14 paralog, lacking miR-499, exhibited an accelerated rate of evolution compared with those containing miR-499, suggesting a putative functional relationship between MYH14 and miR-499. In medaka, Oryzias latipes, miR-499 is present where MYH14 is completely absent in the genome. Furthermore, by using in situ hybridization and small RNA sequencing, miR-499 was expressed in the notochord at the medaka embryonic stage and slow/cardiac muscle at the larval and adult stages. Comparing the flanking sequences of MYH14/miR-499 loci between torafugu Takifugu rubripes, zebrafish Danio rerio, and medaka revealed some highly conserved regions, suggesting that cis-regulatory elements have been functionally conserved in medaka miR-499 despite the loss of its host gene."
2,"This study reveals the evolutionary history of the MYH14/miRNA-499 locus in teleost fish, indicating divergent distribution and expression of MYH14 and miR-499 genes in different teleost fish lineages. We also found that medaka miR-499 was even expressed in the absence of its host gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows the conversion of intronic into non-intronic miRNA during the evolution of a teleost fish lineage."
0,"Reduced muscle activity leads to impaired insulin signaling, which leads to loss of contractile proteins and muscle mass via the Akt pathway. Dietary fish oil rich in long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to prevent insulin signaling resistance in skeletal muscle. This study was conducted to elucidate the protective effect of dietary fish oil on disuse-induced perturbations in insulin signaling and soleus muscle atrophy. To accomplish this, rats were fed a corn-oil- (control) or fish-oil-based diet for 2 weeks, and then subjected to hindlimb immobilization while still receiving the same diets. After 10 days of immobilization, the soleus muscle mass and myosin heavy chain level had markedly decreased; however, these losses were significantly suppressed in rats fed dietary fish oil, compared with the control group. Dietary fish oil nearly completely attenuated the disturbances in activation of the Akt and p70 S6 kinase proteins, as well as the gene expression of muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases (muscle atrophy F-box and muscle RING finger 1). However, insulin receptor substrate 1 associated with the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase was not altered during immobilization. Dietary fish oil also inhibited alterations in the gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, with no additional observation of oxidative stress. Collectively, these findings indicate that dietary fish oil prior to and during immobilization may alleviate the immobilization-induced soleus muscle atrophy, at least in part, via the Akt pathway through E3 ubiquitin ligases and p70s6k."
0,"The high concentrations of mercury found in Amazon have been intensively studied by the scientific community in the last decades. These mercurial species bind preferentially to proteins. Therefore, this work proposal sought to obtain the fractionation, identification and study of mercury - bound proteins present in samples of muscular and hepatic tissue from fish collected in the reservoir of the Jirau Hydroelectric Power Plant - on the Madeira River. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) for protein fractionation, graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) for the quantification of mercury and Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) were used for the identification of proteins. Concluding the work with analysis of graphics from the Blast2go program. Two mercury - bound proteins were identified as triosephosphate isomerase A and Protein FAM45A. The data generated by the bioinformatics programs confirm the tendency of these proteins to be linked to mercury and elucity the possibles existing physiological and cellular interactions."
0,"Oncogenic FGFR3-TACC3 fusions and FGFR3 mutations are target candidates for small molecule inhibitors in bladder cancer (BC). Because FGFR3 and TACC3 genes are located very closely on chromosome 4p16.3, detection of the fusion by DNA-FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) is not a feasible option. In this study, we developed a novel RNA-FISH assay using branched DNA probe to detect FGFR3-TACC3 fusions in formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human BC samples."
1,"The RNA-FISH assay was developed and validated using a mouse xenograft model with human BC cell lines. Next, we assessed the consistency of the RNA-FISH assay using 104 human BC samples. In this study, primary BC tissues were stored as frozen and FFPE tissues. FGFR3-TACC3 fusions were independently detected in FFPE sections by the RNA-FISH assay and in frozen tissues by RT-PCR. We also analyzed the presence of FGFR3 mutations by targeted sequencing of genomic DNA extracted from deparaffinized FFPE sections."
2,"FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcripts were identified by RNA-FISH and RT-PCR in mouse xenograft FFPE tissues using the human BC cell lines RT112 and RT4. These cell lines have been reported to be fusion-positive. Signals for FGFR3-TACC3 fusions by RNA-FISH were positive in 2/60 (3%) of non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC) and 2/44 (5%) muscle-invasive BC (MIBC) patients. The results of RT-PCR of all 104 patients were identical to those of RNA-FISH. FGFR3 mutations were detected in 27/60 (45%) NMIBC and 8/44 (18%) MIBC patients. Except for one NMIBC patient, FGFR3 mutation and FGFR3-TACC3 fusion were mutually exclusive."
3,"We developed an RNA-FISH assay for detection of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion in FFPE samples of human BC tissues. Screening for not only FGFR3 mutations, but also for FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcripts has the potential to identify additional patients that can be treated with FGFR inhibitors."
0,"Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) act as transcription mediators in virus-, bacteria-, and interferon (IFN)-induced signaling pathways and play diverse functions in antimicrobial defense, immune modulation, hematopoietic differentiation, and cell apoptosis. In this study, we described for the first time eleven IRFs (IRF1, IRF1L, IRF2X1, IRF3, IRF4a, IRF4b, IRF5, IRF6, IRF7, IRF8, and IRF9) from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) and examined their tissue distributions and expression patterns under different conditions. The deduced protein sequences of these IRFs (except IRF1) share high identities (71.8-86.6%) with other corresponding IRFs in other teleosts, whereas the sequence identity of IRF1 with the corresponding IRF1 in other teleosts is only 58.1%. A conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD), which is characterized by a winged type helix-loop-helix motif with four to six tryptophan repeats, is present in all IRFs. Another conserved IRF associated domain (IAD), which mediates the interactions in the C-terminal part of the protein, is present in all IRFs except IRF1 and IRF2X1, which instead contain the IAD2 domain. Several special domains also were found, including a serine-rich domain (SRD) in IRF3, IRF4a, IRF4b, and IRF7; a proline-rich domain (PRD) in IRF9; nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in IRF5, IRF8, and IRF9; and a virus activated domain (VAD) in IRF5. Quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that expression of all IRFs occurred in multiple tissues. IRF1, IRF2X1, IRF4a, IRF5, IRF7, and IRF8 exhibited relatively high levels of expression in immune organs, whereas the other five IRFs displayed high levels of expression in non-immune organs. Infection with extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and virus upregulated the expression of IRFs in a manner that depended on tissue type, pathogen, and infection stage. Specifically, IRF1 and IRF2X1 were highly induced by bacterial and viral pathogens; IRF1L and IRF6 responded mainly to extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens; IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, IRF8, and IRF9 were markedly induced by intracellular bacterial pathogen and virus; IRF4a and IRF4b were mainly induced by virus and intracellular bacterial pathogen respectively. These results indicate that the IRFs of C. semilaevis can be categorized into several groups which exhibit different expression patterns in response to the infection of different microbial pathogens. These results provide new insights into the roles of teleost IRFs in antimicrobial immunity."
0,"The information on the genes involved in muscle growth, lipid metabolism and immune systems would help to understand the mechanisms during the spawning migration in Hilsa shad, which in turn would be useful in its future domestication process. The primary objective of this study was to generate the transcriptome profile of its muscle through RNA seq. The total RNA was isolated and library was prepared from muscle tissue of Tenualosa ilisha, which was collected from Padma River at Farakka, India. The prepared library was then sequenced by Illumina HiSeq platform, HiSeq 2000, using paired-end strategy. A total of 8.68 GB of pair-end reads of muscle transcriptome was generated, and 43,384,267 pair-end reads were assembled into 3,04,233 contigs, of which 23.99% of assembled contigs has length ≥ 150 bp. The total GO terms were categorised into cellular component, molecular function and biological process through PANTHER database. Fifty-three genes related to muscle growth were identified and genes in different pathways were: 75 in PI3/AKT, 46 in mTOR, 76 in MAPK signalling, 24 in Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription, 45 in AMPK and 27 in cGMP pathways. This study also mined the genes involved in lipid metabolism, in which glycerophospholipid metabolism contained highest number of genes (32) and four were found to be involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. There were 58 immune related genes found, in which 31 were under innate and 27 under adaptive immunity. The present study included a large genomic resource of T. ilisha muscle generated through RNAseq, which revealed the essential dataset for our understanding of regulatory processes, specifically during the seasonal spawning migration. As Hilsa is a slow growing fish, the genes identified for muscle growth provided the basic information to study myogenesis. In addition, genes identified for lipid metabolism and immune system would provide resources for lipid synthesis and understanding of Hilsa defense mechanisms, respectively."
0,"As fundamental immunologic mechanism, the innate immunity system is more important than the specific immunity system in teleost fishes during pathogens infection. Antimicrobial peptides are integral parts of the innate immune system, and play significant roles against pathogens infection. NK-lysin, the compounds of the natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells, are potent and effective antimicrobial peptides widely distributed in animals. In this study, we reported the sequence characteristics, expression profiles and antibacterial activities of a NK-lysin gene (Lc-NK-lysin) from a commercially important marine fish, the large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). The open reading frame of Lc-NK-lysin cDNA sequence was 447 bp in length, coding 148 amino acids. The genomic DNA of Lc-NK-lysin has the common features of NK-lysin family, consisting of five exons and four introns, and in its deduced mature peptide, there are six well-conserved cysteine residues and a Saposin B domain. Lc-NK-lysin was expressed in all tested tissues (skin, muscle, gill, brain, head kidney, heart, liver, spleen, stomach and intestine) with different expression patterns. In pathogens infection the expression profiles of Lc-NK-lysin varied significantly in gill, head kidney, spleen and liver, indicating its role in immune response. Two peptides (Lc-NK-lysin-1 and Lc-NK-lysin-2) divided from the core region of the Lc-NK-lysin mature polypeptide were chemically synthesized and their antibacterial activities were examined; the potential function on the inhibition of bacteria propagation was revealed. Our results suggested that Lc-NK-lysin is a typical member of the NK-lysin family and as an immune-related gene it involves in the immune response when pathogens invasion. "
0,"To study the substitution of fish oil by vegetable oils in fish diets, juveniles Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) were fed diets (56 % crude protein, 12 % crude lipid) containing either linseed (100LO) or soybean (100SO) oils in comparison with a 100 % fish oil-based diet (100FO) for 90 days. Samples of muscle, liver, and intestine were collected for biochemical analysis and for glucocorticoid receptor-related genes, including GR1 and GR2, and the associated heat shock proteins HSP70, HSP90AA, and HSP90AB. Besides, basal levels of plasma cortisol were also determined. After the feeding period, a stress test, consisting on 5 min of net chasing, was applied to a selected population of each dietary group. Total replacement of fish oil by vegetable oils did not induced changes in fish growth and performance, but affected fatty acid profile of muscle, liver, and intestine, reflecting those tissues the characteristic fatty acids of each type of dietary oil. A tendency to conserve the ARA/EPA ratio could be observed in the different tissues, despite of the level of these fatty acids in diet. Chasing stress induced an increase of muscle GR1 and a reduction in intestinal GR2 relative expressions at any of the experimental diets assayed. In liver, chasing stress induced an increase in both GR1 and GR2 gene expression in fish fed fish oil diets. Similarly, chasing stress induced an increase of muscle HSP70 and decrease of HSP90AB in liver at any of the experimental diet assayed. Besides, vegetable oils decreased the expression of HSP70 in intestine, being the relative expression of liver HSP90AA increased by the inclusion of linseed oil in the diet, at any of the experimental conditions assayed."
0,"Galectins belong to the β-galactoside binding protein family and participate in both innate and acquired immunity. In this study, we described the molecular characteristics of Galectin3 gene from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), designed as PoGalectin3. Its open reading frame was 1128 bp, encoding a protein composed of 375 amino acids. PoGalectin3 belongs to chimeric galactose agglutinin, which contains a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (L<sub>250</sub>-P<sub>372</sub>), and its N-terminal is rich in proline (P) and glycine (G). Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree showed that PoGalectin3 was conservative in different aquatic animals. Tissue distribution confirmed that PoGalectin3 showed significantly highest expression in brain, moderate expression in liver, intestine and muscle. PoGalectin3 was significantly increased post infection with Edwardsiella tarda from intestine tissue of P. olivaceus. In order to investigate the binding ability of PoGalectin3 to pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the recombinant PoGalectin3 protein (rPoGalectin3) was successfully expressed and purified, and an Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiment was performed. ELISA refers to the qualitative and quantitative detection method of immune response by combining soluble antigen or antibody with solid-phase carrier. It was confirmed that rPoGalectin3 exhibited high affinity to lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. The rPoGalectin3 also exhibited a concentration dependent binding capacity with Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas salmonicida, E. tarda, Vibrio vulnificus). In addition, the results of microbial agglutination experiment showed that rPoGalectin3 could agglutinate Gram-positive bacteria (B. pumilus, B. subtilis) and Gram-negative bacteria (A. salmonicida, E. tarda) in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In conclusion, this research laid an important foundation for the specific function analysis of PoGalectin3, which provide theoretical basis for the prevention and control of aquatic diseases."
0,"Pleurocidin (Ple), a linear cationic peptide of 25 amino acids, is a member of a larger family of antimicrobial peptides present in flatfish. Previous studies have shown that Ple displays a strong antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria and appears to play a role in innate host defence. In this work, the genomic sequence encoding the Ple prepropeptide has been isolated from Limanda limanda and cloned in a vector under the control of a non-viral promoter (the carp beta-actin promoter). By using this construction, expression of bioactive Ple was demonstrated in transformed fish cell lines continuously growing for more than 2 years. Furthermore, the study of Ple processing, maturation and secretion (by using fusion with green fluorescence protein) and the high bactericidal activity of the secreted recombinant Ple (detectable in cell supernatants without any concentration) are all reported here, as no other recombinant Ple or fish antimicrobial peptide have been expressed before to that extent. Such an overexpression of recombinant Ple or any other related antimicrobial peptide might improve the chances to develop new antibiotic agents, as well as to provide essential information about the mechanism of action, range of activity and the role in the innate immune response of antibiotic peptides."
0,"The complement system is a critical part of teleost immune defences, with complement component C4 forming part of the classical and lectin pathways. Cod C4-like protein was isolated from plasma, specific antibodies generated and C4-like protein was assessed in cod sera, mucus and in extracellular vesicles (EVs) from serum and mucus. Higher levels of C4-like protein were detected in serum- than mucus-derived EVs. Post-translational deimination, caused by conversion of arginine into citrulline, can affect protein structure and function. Here we detected deiminated forms of C4-like protein in cod serum and at lower levels in mucus. C4-like protein was also found in deiminated form at low levels in EVs from both serum and mucus. C4-like protein was assessed by immunohistochemistry in cod larvae and detected in a range of organs including in liver, kidney, gut, muscle, skin and mucus, as well as in neuronal tissues of the brain, spinal cord and eye. This abundance of C4-like protein during early development may indicate roles in tissue remodelling, in addition to immune defences. The presence of deiminated C4-like protein in serum and mucosa, as well as in EVs, may suggest C4 protein moonlighting via post-translational deimination."
0,"The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) is originally characterized as an endogenous inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to response collagenolysis associated with immune challenge. In this study, the cDNA encoding TIMP-2a gene from red seabream (Pagrus major) muscle was cloned. It was 585 bp encoding a putative protein of 194 amino acids, which comprised all recognized functional domains and showed the high identity to TIMP-2as from other teleost fishes, revealing it belongs to TIMP-2a family. Soluble rTIMP-2a was efficiently expressed using a new constructed pPIC9K-rTIMP-2a vector with high inhibitory activity against to MMP-2 and MMP-9. The recombinant TIMP-2a tagged with 6 histidine residues showed the molecular mass of 23 kDa and isoelectric point of 6.50. Furthermore, the 6 disulfide bonds formed by 12 conserved cysteine residues were identified as functional motifs for its structural stability. In addition, rTIMP-2a possessed the high inhibitory activity against gelatinolytic hydrolysis and degradation of type I collagen which induced by endogenous MMPs in muscle. The results revealed the properties and inhibitory function of rTIMP-2a, which may be a pivotal role in regulation gelatinolytic MMPs metabolization during defense mechanism."
0,"The effects of transporting silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) for 6 h in plastic bags containing 0 (control), 30 or 40 µL/L of essential oil (EO) from Lippia alba leaves were investigated. Prior to transport, the fish in the two experimental groups were sedated with 200 µL/L of EO for 3 min. After transport, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, alkalinity, water hardness, pH, temperature and un-ionized ammonia levels in the transport water did not differ significantly among the groups. However, total ammonia nitrogen levels and net Na(+), Cl(-) and K(+) effluxes were significantly lower in the groups transported with EO of L. alba than those in the control group. PvO2, PvCO2 and HCO3(-) were higher after transporting fish in 40 µL/L of EO of L. alba, but there were no significant differences between groups regarding blood pH or hematocrit. Cortisol levels were significantly higher in fish transported in 30 µL/L of EO of L. alba compared to those of the control group. The metabolic parameters (glycogen, lactate, total amino acid, total ammonia and total protein) showed different responses after adding EO to the transport water. In conclusion, while the EO of L. alba is recommended for fish transport in the conditions tested in the present study because it was effective in reducing waterborne total ammonia levels and net ion loss, the higher hepatic oxidative stress in this species with the same EO concentrations reported by a previous study led us to conclude that the 10-20 µL/L concentration range of EO and lack of pre-sedation before transport are more effective."
0,"Lysozyme is a key component of the innate immune system and plays an important role in antibacterial infection. In this study, we analyzed the expression and activity of a chicken-type (c-type) lysozyme (named SmLysC) from turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). SmLysC is composed of 143 residues and shares 67-90% overall sequence identities with the c-type lysozymes of a number of teleost fish. SmLysC possesses a typical c-type lysozyme domain, which contains the conserved residues E50 and D67 that form the putative catalytic site. SmLysC expression was detected, in increasing order, in head kidney, gill, heart, muscle, brain, spleen, blood, and liver. Bacterial infection caused significant inductions of SmLysC expression in head kidney, spleen, and liver in a time-dependent manner. Immunoblot analysis indicated that SmLysC has a subcellular localization in the extracellular milieu. Recombinant SmLysC (rSmLysC) was able to bind to bacterial cells and inhibit bacterial growth. Enzyme assay showed that the optimal temperature and pH of rSmLysC were 37 °C and pH 6.0 respectively. In contrast to rSmLysC, the mutant protein rSmLysCM1, which bears alanine substitutions at E50 and D67, displayed drastically reduced bacteriolytic activity. rSmLysC was able to inhibit the growth of several fish bacterial pathogens in a manner that depended on the dose of the protein; however, Gram-positive bacteria were in general more sensitive to rSmLysC than Gram-negative bacteria. Together these results indicate that SmLysC is a functional lysozyme that is likely to participate in innate immune defense against extracellular bacterial pathogens, in particular those of Gram-positive nature."
0,"Effects of glyphosate based herbicide, Excel Mera 71 at a dose of 17.20mg/l on enzyme activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and protein content were measured in different tissues of two Indian air-breathing teleosts, Anabas testudineus (Bloch) and Heteropneustes fossilis (Bloch) during an exposure period of 30 days under laboratory condition. AChE activity was significantly increased in all the investigated tissues of both fish species and maximum elevation was observed in brain of H. fossilis, while spinal cord of A. testudineus showed minimum increment. Fishes showed significant increase LPO levels in all the tissues; highest was observed in gill of A. testudineus but lowest LPO level was observed in muscle of H. fossilis. CAT was also enhanced in both the fishes, while GST activity in liver diminished substantially and minimum was observed in liver of A. testudineus. Total protein content showed decreased value in all the tissues, maximum reduction was observed in liver and minimum in brain of A. testudineus and H. fossilis respectively. The results indicated that Excel Mera 71 caused serious alterations in the enzyme activities resulting into severe deterioration of fish health; so, AChE, LPO, CAT and GST can be used as suitable indicators of herbicidal toxicity.

0,"PTEN is a key tumor suppressor gene that can play a regulatory role in the cellular proliferation, survival and apoptosis. In this study, the full-length PTEN (EcPTEN) was obtained, containing a 5'UTR of 745 bp, an ORF of 1269 bp and a 3'UTR of 106 bp. The EcPTEN gene encoded a polypeptide of 422 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 49.14 KDa and a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 6.34. The deduced amino acid sequence analysis showed that EcPTEN comprised the conserved residues and the characteristic domains known to the critical functionality of PTEN. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that EcPTEN mRNA was broadly expressed in all the examined tissues, while the highest expression level was observed in liver, followed by the expression in blood, kidney, spleen, heart, gill, muscle and intestine. The groupers challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus showed a sharp increase of EcPTEN mRNA expression in immune tissues. In addition, western blotting analysis confirmed that the up-regulation of EcPTEN protein expression was steadily induced in liver. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that EcPTEN was localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Overexpression of EcPTEN can activate the apoptotic cascade and abrogate NF-kB, AP-1, Stat3 and Myc promoter activity in Hela cells. These results indicated that EcPTEN harboring highly-conserved domains with a close sequence similarity to those of PTP superfamily may disrupt the mammalian signalings and play a regulatory role in the apoptotic process."
0,"Ferritin is a major intracellular iron storage protein in higher vertebrates and plays an important role in iron metabolism. In this study, we identified and analyzed the biological activity of a ferritin M subunit (CsFerM) from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). The open reading frame (ORF) of CsFerM is 534 bp and encodes a protein that shares 79.7-86.4% overall sequence identities with the ferritin M subunits of a number of teleosts. In silico analysis identified in CsFerM a eukaryotic ferritin domain with conserved ferroxidase diiron center and ferrihydrite nucleation center. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis showed that under normal physiological conditions, expression of CsFerM was highest in liver, moderate in gill, spleen, and muscle, and low in gut, heart, and brain. Following experimental challenge with bacterial pathogens, CsFerM expression was significantly upregulated in kidney, spleen, and liver in time-dependent manners. Biological activity analysis showed that recombinant CsFerM purified from Escherichia coli exhibited apparent iron-binding activity and, when present in the culture medium of six different species of fish bacterial pathogens, completely inhibited bacterial growth. In contrast, a mutant CsFerM that bears alanine substitution at two conserved residues of the ferroxidase diiron center and ferrihydrite nucleation center was abolished in both iron-binding and antimicrobial capacity. These results demonstrate that CsFerM is a biologically active iron chelator with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, which suggests a role for CsFerM in not only iron storage but also innate immunity. These results also indicate the importance of the conserved iron uptake and mineralization sites to the function of CsFerM."
0,"Hypoxia tolerance is a plastic trait, and can vary between species. We compared hypoxia tolerance (hypoxic loss of equilibrium, LOE, and critical O2 tension, Pcrit) and traits that dictate O2 transport and metabolism in pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), bluegill (L. macrochirus), and the naturally occurring hybrid in different acclimation environments (wild versus lab-acclimated fish) and at different temperatures. Wild fish generally had lower Pcrit and lower PO2 at LOE in progressive hypoxia than lab-acclimated fish, but time to LOE in sustained hypoxia (PO2 of 2kPa) did not vary between environments. Wild fish also had greater gill surface area and higher haematocrit, suggesting that increased O2 transport capacity underlies the environmental variation in Pcrit. Metabolic (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; pyruvate kinase, PK; citrate synthase; cytochrome c oxidase) and antioxidant (catalase and superoxide dismutase) enzyme activities varied appreciably between environments. Wild fish had higher protein contents across tissues and higher activities of LDH in heart, PK in brain, and catalase in brain, liver, and skeletal muscle. Otherwise, wild fish had lower activities for most enzymes. Warming temperature from 15 to 25°C increased O2 consumption rate, Pcrit, PO2 at LOE, and haemoglobin-O2 affinity, and decreased time to LOE, but pumpkinseed had ≥2-fold longer time to LOE than bluegill and hybrids across this temperature range. This was associated with higher LDH activities in the heart and muscle, and lower or similar antioxidant enzyme activities in several tissues. However, the greater hypoxia tolerance of pumpkinseed collapsed at 28°C, demonstrating that the interactive effects of hypoxia and warming temperature can differ between species. Overall, distinct mechanisms appear to underpin interspecific and environment-induced variation in hypoxia tolerance in sunfish."
0,"Physicochemical and gelation properties of myofibrillar proteins from silver carp surimi as affected by chopping under different vacuum degrees (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08 MPa) were investigated. With the increase of vacuum degree, size and quantity of air bubbles in surimi paste decreased, disulfide bond content of myofibrillar proteins decreased significantly (p < .05) and then slight increased (p > .05), while surface hydrophobicity of myofibrillar proteins increased gradually (p < .05). Gel mechanical properties, chemical interactions (nonspecific associations, hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions) and FAXL (cross-linking degree of free amino group) of heat-induced surimi gel increased significantly (p < .05) with vacuum degree. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation showed that three-dimensional network of surimi gel under higher vacuum degree was more compact and orderly. Results indicated that vacuum chopping imparted physicochemical and structural changes of fish myofibrillar protein, which might contribute to the improvement in gelling properties of myofibrillar proteins."
0,"Bax is a pro-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 like superfamily, playing an important role in regulating the apoptosis. In this study, the full-length Bax (EcBax) was obtained, containing a 5'UTR of 64 bp, an ORF of 579 bp and a 3'UTR of 1021 bp. The EcBax gene encoded a polypeptide of 192 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 21.55 KDa and a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 6.75. The deduced amino acid sequence analysis showed that EcBax comprised the conserved residues and the characteristic domains known to the critical function of Bax. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that EcBax mRNA was broadly expressed in all of the examined tissues, while the highest expression level was observed in blood, followed by the expression in liver, gill, spleen, kidney, heart, muscle and intestine. A sharp increase of EcBax expression was observed in the vibrio challenge group by comparing with those in the control. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that EcBax was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. EcBax exerted a regulatory role in modulating the mitochondrial membrane potential, promoting the cytochrome c release, and then activating the downstream caspase signaling. Moreover, the overexpression of EcBax can decrease the cell viability and antagonize NF-kB, AP-1, Stat3 promoter activity in Hela cells. These results indicate that EcBax containing the conserved domain of pro-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family may disrupt the mammalian signaling and play a regulative role in the apoptotic process. "
0,"IKKε is an IκB kinase functioning in NF-κB signal pathway in the innate immune system of higher vertebrates. To exploit the function of IKKε of black carp (bcIKKε) in its antiviral innate immunity, the IKKε gene has been cloned from the RNA isolated from the spleen of black carp. The full-length cDNA of bcIKKε is 2537 bp, which encodes the peptide of 723 amino acids. bcIKKε contains a S-Tkc domain, a PKc domain and a UBL-TBK1-like domain and bcIKKε shares the highest amino acid sequence similarity with that of grass carp. bcIKKε was constitutively transcribed in the selected tissues of black carp including gill, kidney, heart, intestine, liver, muscle, skin and spleen; and the mRNA level of bcIKKε in these tissues varied right after SVCV or GCRV infection. bcIKKε had been well expressed in HEK293T cells and western blot assay determined that this fish kinase was around 80 KDa. The immunofluorescence assay of both NH3T3 cells and EPC cells demonstrated that bcIKKε was located in the cytosolic part of the cell. Report assay result showed that overexpression of bcIKKε in EPC cells activated the expression of both zebrafish IFN and EPC IFN. All our data suggest that bcIKKε is a novel fish kinase functioning in the innate antiviral immune response of black carp."
0,"Ribonuclease 1 (RNase1) is an important digestive enzyme that has been used to study the molecular evolutionary and plant-feeding adaptation of mammals. However, the expression patterns and potential biological function of RNase1 in herbivorous fish is not known. Here, we identified RNase1 from five fish species and illuminated the functional diversification and expression of RNase1 in herbivorous Megalobrama amblycephala. The five identified fish RNase1 genes all have the signature motifs of the RNase A superfamily. No expression of Ma-RNase1 was detected in early developmental stages but a weak expression was detected at 120 and 144 hours post-fertilization (hpf). Ma-RNase1 was only expressed in the liver and heart of one-year-old fish but strongly expressed in the liver, spleen, gut, kidney and testis of two-year-old fish. Moreover, the immunostaining localized RNase1 production to multiple tissues of two-year-old fish. A biological functional analysis of the recombinant protein demonstrated that M. amblycephala RNase1 had a relatively strong ribonuclease activity at its optimal pH 6.1, which is consistent with the pH of its intestinal microenvironment. Collectively, these results clearly show that Ma-RNase1 protein has ribonuclease activity and the expression patterns of Ma-RNase1 are dramatically different in one year and two-year-old fish, suggesting the functional differentiation during fish growing.

0,"Zebrafish skeletal muscles are broadly divided into slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscle fibers. The slow fibers, which express a slow fiber-specific myosin heavy chain 1 (Smyhc1), are the first group of muscle fibers formed during myogenesis. To uncover Smyhc1 function in muscle growth, we generated three mutant alleles with reading frame shift mutations in the zebrafish smyhc1 gene using CRISPR. The mutants showed shortened sarcomeres with no thick filaments and M-lines in slow fibers of the mutant embryos. However, the formation of slow muscle precursors and expression of other slow muscle genes were not affected and fast muscles appeared normal. The smyhc1 mutant embryos and larvae showed reduced locomotion and food intake. The mutant larvae exhibited increased lethality of incomplete penetrance. Approximately 2/5 of the homozygous mutants were viable and grew into reproductive adults. These adult mutants displayed a typical pattern of slow and fast muscle fiber distribution, and regained normal slow muscle formation. Together, our studies indicate that Smyhc1 is essential for myogenesis in embryonic slow muscles, and loss of Smyhc1 results in defective sarcomere assembly, reduces larval motility and fish survival, but has no visible impact on muscle growth in juvenile and adult zebrafish that escape the larval lethality."
0,"Authenticity is crucial to the seafood industry, as substitution and mislabeling have important economic, environmental, and food safety consequences. To address this problem, protein profiling and software algorithm techniques were developed to classify fish muscle samples by species. The method uses water-based protein extraction, chip-based microfluidic electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer) for the analysis of high abundance fish muscle proteins, and a novel data analysis method for species-specific protein pattern recognition. The method's performance in distinguishing commercially important fish from commonly reported substitutions was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy determinations with all three performance measures at >98% for common substitutions. This study demonstrates that uncooked seafood products of commercially important species of catfish, snapper, and grouper can be rapidly distinguished from commonly substituted species with a high level of confidence. A tiered testing approach to seafood species verification by sequentially applying a rapid screening method and DNA testing is proposed to more effectively ensure accurate product labeling."
0,"Apelin is a recently discovered peptide produced by several tissues with diverse physiological actions mediated by its receptor APJ. In order to better understand the role of apelin in the regulation of appetite in fish, we cloned the cDNAs encoding apelin and APJ, and investigated their mRNA distributions in Ya-fish (Schizothorax prenanti) tissues. We also assessed the effects of different nutritional status on apelin and APJ mRNAs abundance. Apelin and APJ mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested, relatively high expression levels were detected in the heart, spleen, hypothalamus and kidney. Short-term fasting significant increased APJ mRNA expression, but no significant difference between fasted fish and fed control on 5- and 7-day. Meanwhile, apelin mRNA expression consistently increased during the 7-day food deprivation. In order to further characterize apelin in fish, we performed intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of apelin-13 and examined food intake of the injected fish. Apelin injected at a dose of 100 ng/g body weight induced a significant increase in food intake compared to saline injected fish. Our results suggest that apelin acts as an orexigenic factor in Ya-fish. Their widespread distributions also suggest that apelin and APJ might play multiple physiological regulating roles in fish."
0,"Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) plays a pivotal role in the induction of type I IFNs in higher vertebrates. To explore the function of TBK1 in teleost, TBK1 of black carp (Mylopharyngodon Piceus) was cloned and characterized in this paper. The full-length cDNA of black carp TBK1 (bcTBK1) consists of 2857 nucleotides and the predicted bcTBK1 protein contains 727 amino acids, which includes an N-terminal kinase domain (KD), an ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) and two C-terminal coiled-coils. The transcription of bcTBK1 was constitutively detected in all the selected tissues and bcTBK1 mRNA level was increased in all selected tissues in response to SVCV or GCRV infection except that in muscle post GCRV invasion. The transcription of bcTBK1 in Mylopharyngodon Piceus fin (MPF) cells was up-regulated by the stimulation of SVCV, GCRV or poly (I:C) but not by LPS treatment. bcTBK1 migrated around 80 kDa in immunoblot assay and was identified as a cytosolic protein by immunofluorescence staining. bcTBK1 showed strong IFN-inducing ability in reporter assay and presented strong antiviral activity against both GCRV and SVCV in EPC cells. The reporter assay demonstrated that TRAF6 of black carp (bcTRAF6) up-regulated bcTBK1-induced IFN expression and the subcellular distribution of bcTBK1 overlapped with that of bcTRAF6 when these two proteins were co-expressed in EPC cells. Taken together, our study support the conclusion that bcTBK1 plays an important role in the antiviral innate immune response of black carp against SVCV and GCRV, in which its activity was positively regulated by bcTRAF6."
0,"In this study, the chemical characterization of glycoconjugates of myofibrillar proteins from grass carp conjugated with glucose via Maillard reaction for up to 24 h of dry-heating was investigated, and their impacts on the microbial community in vitro human fecal fermentation were firstly evaluated by high-throughput sequencing technologies. The glycation greatly increased the furosine levels in glycoconjugates, which reached the maximum level (2.87 ± 0.08 mg per 100 mg protein) for 9 h of heating, and resulted in the structural changes of myofibrillar proteins based on the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis of digested glycoconjugates showed that the gradually increased proportion between 1423 Da (bacitracin)-12 588 Da (cytochrome C) with the prolongation of heating time, suggesting that glycation decreased the digestibility of myofibrillar proteins. Furthermore, glycoconjugates with a higher level of Amadori products and lower browning intensity enhanced fecal microbiota diversity based on species-level phylotypes. The production of butyrate in fermentation of digested glycoconjugates was affected by the glycation extent of myofibrillar proteins, and significantly and positively correlated with Mitsuokella, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-004, Sutterella, Salinimicrobium, Fodinibius and Nitriliruptor (p < 0.05), but negatively correlated with Enterococcus, Dorea (p < 0.05), Escherichia-Shigella and Phascolarctobacterium (p < 0.01). Our findings demonstrated that the glycation of myofibrillar proteins could have potentially positive effects to intestinal health."
0,"Pacific whiting (Merluccius productus) muscle was used to produce hydrolysates with 10%, 15% and 20% degree of hydrolysis (DH) using the commercial protease Alcalase(®) and were characterized at pH 4.0, 7.0 and 10 according their solubility, emulsifying and foaming properties. Protein recovered in soluble fractions increased proportionally with the hydrolytic process, yielded 48.6±1.9, 58.6±4.1 and 67.8±1.4 of total protein after 10%, 15% and 20% DH, respectively. Freeze-dried hydrolysates presented almost 100% solubility (p>0.05) at the different pHs evaluated. Emulsifying properties (EC, EAI and ESI) were not affected by DH as most samples showed similar (p>0.05) results. Higher EC (p⩽0.05) than sodium caseinate, used as control, were obtained at pH 4 for most hydrolysates. Hydrolysates showed very low foaming capacity not affected by pH; but foam stability was equal or even better (p>0.05) than bovine serum albumin (BSA), except at pH 4.0. Results suggest that hydrolysates from Pacific whiting muscle can be produced with similar or better functional properties than the food ingredients used as standards. "
0,"Glucocorticoids are key stress-related hormones in vertebrates, with cortisol being the main glucocorticoid in teleosts. Glucocorticoids exert their effects through two mechanisms of action: genomic/classic and membrane initiated. In mammals, cortisol-mediated stress has been found to be associated with increased expression of critical atrophy-related genes (atrogenes), such as MAFbx/atrogin-1 and murf1/trim63. However, the direct impact of cortisol on the early regulation of atrogene expression in teleost skeletal muscle and the contribution of membrane-initiated cortisol action to this process have not been identified. In this work, the mRNA levels of atrogin-1 and murf1 were assessed in isolated myotubes and skeletal muscle of rainbow trout administered with cortisol or cortisol-BSA. This latter compound is a membrane-impermeable cortisol analog that exclusively induces membrane-initiated effects. We found that cortisol (10 mg/kg) first decreased the expression of both atrogenes at 3 h of treatment and then increased their expression at 9 h of treatment in the skeletal muscle of rainbow trout. Additionally, the in vitro analysis suggested that membrane-initiated cortisol action regulates murf1 but not atrogin-1 in rainbow trout myotubes. Using RU486 to selectively block glucocorticoid receptor (GR), we found that early downregulation of murf1 is potentially mediated by membrane GR signaling in myotubes. Considering the results of both the in vivo and in vitro approaches, we suggest that membrane-initiated cortisol action regulates the early expression of atrophy-related processes in teleosts."
0,"Lizard fish (Saurida elongata) muscle protein was hydrolyzed using neutral protease to produce protein hydrolysate (LFPH), and the hydrolysis conditions were investigated using response-surface methodology. The optimum conditions for producing peptides with the highest angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were the following: enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 10,000 U/g, temperature of 48 °C, pH 7.0, and hydrolysis time of 2 h. Under these conditions, the ACE-inhibitory activity of LFPH and the degree of hydrolysis were 84% and 24%, respectively. A novel ACE-inhibitory peptide was isolated from LFPH using ultrafiltration, Sephadex G-15, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the ACE-inhibitory peptide was identified as Ser-Pro-Arg-Cys-Arg (SPRCR), and its IC₅₀ was 41 ± 1 µM."
0,"The effects of exposure to one-third and one-fifth sublethal concentrations (0.106 and 0.064 mg/L) of sodium cyanide on protein metabolism on freshwater carp, Labeo rohita, was studied. Three functionally different tissues, namely, the liver, muscle, and gills, were studied after 5, 10, and 15 days. Exposures produced marked changes in protein metabolic profile in all tissues studied. These changes were more pronounced in the one-third sublethal concentration, suggesting a cumulative action of toxicant. This investigation revealed that the total, structural, and soluble proteins and urea content in all the three tissues were decreased, whereas free amino acids, ammonia, and enzyme activity (i.e., protease, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase) exhibited elevated levels at both sublethal concentrations. Variation in protein metabolism in the fish, induced by sodium cyanide, demonstrated its toxic effects on cellular metabolism, thereby leading to impaired protein synthetic machinery. The results of the present study indicate that a mechanism of impaired energy transformation has direct action on the fish, L. rohita, and its impact is clearly evident from the change in the nutritional content of the fish."
0,"Fish muscle, which accounts for 15%-25% of the total protein in fish, is a desirable protein source. Their hydrolysate is in high demand nutritionally as a functional food and thus has high potential added value. The hydrolysate contains physiologically active amino acids and various essential nutrients, the contents of which depend on the source of protein, protease, hydrolysis method, hydrolysis conditions, and degree of hydrolysis. Therefore, it can be utilized for various industrial applications including use in nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals to help improve the health of humans. This review discusses muscle protein hydrolysates generated from the muscles of various fish species, as well as their amino acid composition, and highlights their functional properties and bioactivity. In addition, the role of the amino acid profile in regulating the biological and physiological activities, nutrition, and bitter taste of hydrolysates is discussed."
0,"Initially we characterised growth responses to altered nutritional input at the transcriptional and tissue levels in the fast skeletal muscle of juvenile gilthead sea bream. Fish reared at 21-22°C (range) were fed a commercial diet at 3% body mass d(-1) (non-satiation feeding, NSF) for 4 weeks, fasted for 4d (F) and then fed to satiation (SF) for 21d. 13 out of 34 genes investigated showed consistent patterns of regulation between nutritional states. Fasting was associated with a 20-fold increase in MAFbx, and a 5-fold increase in Six1 and WASp expression, which returned to NSF levels within 16h of SF. Refeeding to satiation was associated with a rapid (<24 h) 12 to 17-fold increase in UNC45, Hsp70 and Hsp90α transcripts coding for molecular chaperones associated with unfolded protein response pathways. The growth factors FGF6 and IGF1 increased 6.0 and 4.5-fold within 16 h and 24 h of refeeding respectively. The average growth in diameter of fast muscle fibres was checked with fasting and significant fibre hypertrophy was only observed after 13d and 21d SF. To investigate developmental plasticity in growth responses we used the same experimental protocol with fish reared at either 17.5-18.5°C (range) (LT) or 21-22°C (range) (HT) to metamorphosis and then transferred to 21-22°C. There were persistent effects of development temperature on muscle growth patterns with 20% more fibres of lower average diameter in LT than HT group of similar body size. Altering the nutritional input to the muscle to stimulate growth revealed cryptic changes in the expression of UNC45 and Hsp90α with higher transcript abundance in the LT than HT groups, whereas there were no differences in the expression of MAFbx and Six1. It was concluded that myogenesis and gene expression patterns during growth are not fixed, but can be modified by temperature during the early stages of the life cycle."
0,"Nutritional profiles and consumer preferences differ between wild and farmed fish, and identification of fish sources can be difficult. We analyzed the metabolite molecules of wild and farmed red sea bream ( Pagrus major) to identify specific metabolic differences. The total lipid content and molecular composition of wild and farmed red sea bream muscles were analyzed using thin-layer chromatography and mass spectrometry imaging. Triacylglycerol levels were significantly higher in farmed fish. Wild fish contained saturated-fatty-acid-containing triacylglycerols as a major molecular species, while docosahexaenoic-acid-containing triacylglycerol levels were significantly higher in farmed fish than in wild fish. The localization of each muscle-fiber-type-specific marker demonstrated that wild fish exhibit myosin heavy chain (MHC)-type-IIb-specific phospholipids, while farmed fish exhibit MHC-type-IIa-specific phospholipids in their white muscle. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses separated the identified myosins and revealed that farmed fish possess additional myosin isoforms when compared to wild fish. In addition, we found a farmed-fish-specific distribution of anserine in their white muscle. These molecules can be used as new molecular markers for determining the geographic origins of wild versus farmed red sea bream."
0,"The antioxidant effect of porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was previously demonstrated. Understanding how PLA2 inhibits lipid oxidation promoted by hemoglobin (Hb) is important for its applications in muscle foods. Effects of enzyme dose, pH, and calcium ion on the ability of PLA2 to inhibit trout hemoglobin-mediated lipid oxidation were investigated in washed cod muscle (WCM). Results indicated that PLA2 required calcium ion for both the hydrolyzing activity and the antioxidant effect. The abilities of PLA2 to inhibit lipid oxidation and suppress oxidation of Hb to form methemoglobin and ferryl hemoglobin were pH-dependent. The lag phase before lipid oxidation enters the exponential phase reciprocally shortened as more hemin was bound to the insoluble matrix of WCM. However, PLA2 was able to inhibit lipid oxidation without preventing the interaction between hemin and the insoluble matrix of the washed muscle."
0,"Heating and changes in pH often practised during fish protein hydrolysis can cause lipid oxidation. The effect of natural antioxidants towards haemoglobin-mediated lipid oxidation during enzymatic hydrolysis of cod proteins was investigated. Different variants of a washed cod model system, containing different combinations of haemoglobin and natural antioxidants (l-ascorbic acid and Fuscus vesiculosus extract), were hydrolysed using Protease P ""Amano"" 6 at pH 8 and 36°C to achieve 20% degree of hydrolysis. Lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were analysed periodically during the hydrolysis process. The in vitro antioxidant activity of the final products was investigated. Results indicate that oxidation can develop rapidly during hydrolysis and antioxidant strategies are preferable to produce good quality products. Oxidation products did not have an impact on the in vitro antioxidant activity of the hydrolysates. The natural antioxidants inhibited oxidation during hydrolysis and contributed to the antioxidant activity of the final product. "
0,"TTRAP (TRAF and TNF receptor-associated protein) is latest identified cytosolic protein that serves as a negative regulator for TNF signaling pathway. In this study, a member of TNF superfamily, TTRAP gene (designed as EcTTRAP) was cloned from grouper, Epinephelus coioides. There was an Exo_endo_phos type domain in EcTTRAP, and it was well conserved when compared with other TTRAPs, especially the endonuclease activity related motifs. EcTTRAP exhibited prominent endonuclease activity against the genome DNA from Escherichia coli, Vibrio vulnificus and E. coli JM109. Intracellular localization revealed that EcTTRAP expression distributed in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Real-time PCR analysis indicates that EcTTRAP is expressed in all selective grouper tissues, with the higher expression level in muscle, skin and gills. EcTTRAP was identified as a remarkably (P < 0.01) up-regulated protein responding to Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) infection. Overexpression of EcTTRAP inhibited NF-κB activation, meanwhile the C terminal portion of the protein was found to be responsive domain for the inhibition. Stable transfection of FHM cells with EcTTRAP inhibited apoptosis induced by SGIV. Overexpression of EcTTRAP in grouper spleen (GS) cells inhibited the replication of SGIV. The present results provided new evidences for the potential roles of such molecule in E. coioides, and further confirmed the existence of TTRAP modulated TNF signaling pathway in grouper."
0,"The Atlantic salmon <i>Salmo salar</i> survives below 10 °C. The main skeletal muscle is composed of a single isoform of tropomyosin (classified as Tpm1 α-fast) that is >92% identical to the mammalian homologue. How salmon Tpm1 maintains flexibility is investigated by reversing the only full charge substitution; threonine-77(g) in salmon and lysine in other vertebrates. The mutation (Thr-77 to Lys), which falls within a known destabilizing alanine cluster, (i) yields a useful electrophoretic shift in the absence and presence of an anionic detergent, (ii) increases the <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>s of both cooperative transitions (calorimetry, 0.1 M salt, pH 7) [35 °C (minor) and 44 °C (major); Δ<i>T</i><sub>m1</sub> = 5 °C, Δ<i>T</i><sub>m2</sub> = 3.5 °C], (iii) increases the <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> of CN1A (residues 11-127) to 53 °C (Δ<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = 13 °C), a value similar to that of mammalian CN1A, (iv) markedly reduces the rate of proteolysis at Leu-169, and (v) weakens the affinity of salmon Tpm1 for troponin-Sepharose. Glu-82(e), the interstrand ionic partner of Lys-77(g), is conserved. The change in ionic interactions at this locus is postulated to be ""sensed"" in actin period 5 (residues 166-207) and likely beyond. Wild type (acetylated) salmon Tmp1 binds more tightly to F-actin at 4 °C than at 22 °C, which is the opposite of the long-known relationship displayed by the mammalian homologue. All of the evidence indicates that the presence of a neutral 77th amino acid destabilizes a sizable portion of salmon Tpm1 that includes the midregion. Threonine-77 is a key factor in rescuing the thin filament from the peril of cold-induced rigidity."
0,"The objective of this study was to investigate the differential role of cathepsin B, L, D and calpain in degradation and disassembly of myofilament. Myofibrillar protein of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) was incubated with proteases monotonously, simultaneously or sequentially. Subsequently, protein degradation were detected using SDS-PAGE and myofilament disassembly induced by changes of non-covalent interactions were measured through SDS-PAGE using l-Ethyl-3-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl) Carbodiimide (EDC) as a zero length cross-linker. Additionally, content of heat shock proteins which functioned in stabilizing assembly architecture of myofibrillar protein was determined. Results showed that calpain and cathepsin B, calpain and cathepisn L could act in a stepwise and complimentary manner to synergistically dissociate and degrade myofibrillar protein. In synergistic action, cathepsin B disrupted the thick filament assembly through lowering the UNC45 and HSP90 concentration in myofibrillar protein, facilitating the degradation of dissociated MHC by calpain. Meanwhile, Cathepsin L was shown to preferentially remove the actin from thin filament via lowering the content of HSP27 and αb-crystallin, to create dissociated actin as substrate supply for calpain."
0,"The jeju Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus and the traira Hoplias malabaricus are two closely related erythrinid fish, both possessing a two-chambered physostomous swimbladder. In the jeju the anterior section of the posterior bladder is highly vascularized and the swimbladder is used for aerial respiration; the traira, in turn, is a water-breather that uses the swimbladder as a buoyancy organ and not for aerial oxygen uptake. Observation of the breathing behavior under different levels of water oxygenation revealed that the traira started aquatic surface respiration only under severe hypoxic conditions and did not breathe air. In the jeju air-breathing behavior was observed under normoxic conditions, and the frequency of air-breathing was significantly increased under hypoxic conditions. Unexpectedly, even under hyperoxic conditions (30 mg O2 L(-1)) the jeju continued to take air breaths, and compared with normoxic conditions the frequency was not reduced. Because the frequently air-exposed swimbladder tissue faces higher oxygen partial pressures than normally experienced by other fish tissues, it was hypothesized that in the facultative air-breathing jeju, swimbladder tissue would have a higher antioxidative capacity than the swimbladder tissue of the water breathing traira. Measurement of total glutathione (GSSG/GSH) concentration in anterior and posterior swimbladder tissue revealed a higher concentration of this antioxidant in swimbladder tissue as compared to muscle tissue in the jeju. Furthermore, the GSSG/GSH concentration in jeju tissues was significantly higher than in traira tissues. Similarly, activities of enzymes involved in the breakdown of reactive oxygen species were significantly higher in the jeju swimbladder as compared to the traira swimbladder. The results show that the jeju, using the swimbladder as an additional breathing organ, has an enhanced antioxidative capacity in the swimbladder as compared to the traira, using the swimbladder only as a buoyancy organ."
0,"In mammals, growing evidence indicates that exercise affects food intake, metabolism and the expression and blood levels of appetite regulators. In this study, we examined the effects of short-term (30 min, at low and high water flow) exercise on food intake, glucose levels and the expressions of appetite regulators in goldfish hypothalamus (irisin, orexin, CART, leptin), intestine (CCK, PYY, proglucagon/GLP-1), muscle (irisin) and liver (leptin), of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in brain, interleukin-6 (IL6) in muscle and hypothalamus, and major metabolic enzymes, the glycolytic enzyme glucokinase (GCK) and its regulatory protein (GCKR) in liver, the lipolytic enzyme lipoprotein lipase in intestine and muscle, and trypsin in intestine. Fish submitted to high flow exercise had a lower post-exercise food intake compared to control fish but no differences were seen in glucose levels between groups. Exercise induced an increase in hypothalamic expression levels of CART, IL6 and BDNF, but not orexin, irisin, CRF, leptin and NPY. High flow exercise induced an increase in intestine CCK, PYY and GLP-1, and muscle irisin and IL-6 expression levels. Exercise had no effects on expression levels of hepatic leptin or any of the metabolic enzymes examined. Our results suggest that, in goldfish, short-term exercise might decrease feeding in part by affecting the expressions of myokines and peripheral, but not central appetite regulators or metabolic enzyme/hormones."
0,"αδ-Bungarotoxins, a novel group of long-chain α-neurotoxins, manifest different affinity to two agonist/competitive antagonist binding sites of muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), being more active at the interface of α-δ subunits. Three isoforms (αδ-BgTx-1-3) were identified in Malayan Krait (<i>Bungarus candidus</i>) from Thailand by genomic DNA analysis; two of them (αδ-BgTx-1 and 2) were isolated from its venom. The toxins comprise 73 amino acid residues and 5 disulfide bridges, being homologous to α-bungarotoxin (α-BgTx), a classical blocker of muscle-type and neuronal α7, α8, and α9α10 nAChRs. The toxicity of αδ-BgTx-1 (LD<sub>50</sub> = 0.17-0.28 µg/g mouse, i.p. injection) is essentially as high as that of α-BgTx. In the chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparation, αδ-BgTx-1 completely abolished acetylcholine response, but in contrast with the block by α-BgTx, acetylcholine response was fully reversible by washing. αδ-BgTxs, similar to α-BgTx, bind with high affinity to α7 and muscle-type nAChRs. However, the major difference of αδ-BgTxs from α-BgTx and other naturally occurring α-neurotoxins is that αδ-BgTxs discriminate the two binding sites in the <i>Torpedo californica</i> and mouse muscle nAChRs showing up to two orders of magnitude higher affinity for the α-δ site as compared with α-ε or α-γ binding site interfaces. Molecular modeling and analysis of the literature provided possible explanations for these differences in binding mode; one of the probable reasons being the lower content of positively charged residues in αδ-BgTxs. Thus, αδ-BgTxs are new tools for studies on nAChRs."
0,"The effects of curdlan in combination with microbial transglutaminase on the gelling properties of hairtail muscle protein were investigated. When curdlan of 4g/100g paste was combined with transglutaminase at a concentration of 0.4units/g meat paste, the gel strength, water holding capacity and the whiteness of the heated gel were improved. Textural profiles, such as hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, guminess and chewiness, reached their peaks as well. The increased band intensity of cross-linked proteins, accompanied by weakened myosin heavy chain, was observed from the SDS-PAGE pattern, indicating that curdlan might activate the formation of more ε-(γ-glutamyl) lysine cross-links induced by transglutaminase, especially at the level of 0.4units/g paste, leading to a denser gel matrix.

0,"A genomics approach was used to identify nutritionally regulated genes involved in growth of fast skeletal muscle in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Forward and reverse subtractive cDNA libraries were prepared comparing fish with zero growth rates to fish growing rapidly. We produced 7,420 ESTs and assembled them into nonredundant clusters prior to annotation. Contigs representing 40 potentially unrecognized nutritionally responsive candidate genes were identified. Twenty-three of the subtractive library candidates were also differentially regulated by nutritional state in an independent fasting-refeeding experiment and their expression placed in the context of 26 genes with established roles in muscle growth regulation. The expression of these genes was also determined during the maturation of a primary myocyte culture, identifying 13 candidates from the subtractive cDNA libraries with putative roles in the myogenic program. During early stages of refeeding DNAJA4, HSPA1B, HSP90A, and CHAC1 expression increased, indicating activation of unfolded protein response pathways. Four genes were considered inhibitory to myogenesis based on their in vivo and in vitro expression profiles (CEBPD, ASB2, HSP30, novel transcript GE623928). Other genes showed increased expression with feeding and highest in vitro expression during the proliferative phase of the culture (FOXD1, DRG1) or as cells differentiated (SMYD1, RTN1, MID1IP1, HSP90A, novel transcript GE617747). The genes identified were associated with chromatin modification (SMYD1, RTN1), microtubule stabilization (MID1IP1), cell cycle regulation (FOXD1, CEBPD, DRG1), and negative regulation of signaling (ASB2) and may play a role in the stimulation of myogenesis during the transition from a catabolic to anabolic state in skeletal muscle."
0,"Myostatin (growth and differentiation factor-8) is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, is expressed mainly in skeletal muscle and acts as a negative growth regulator. Mature myostatin (C-terminal) is a homodimer that is cleaved post-translationally from the precursor myostatin, also yielding the N-terminal prodomain. We expressed in Escherichia coli three forms of fish myostatin: precursor, prodomain and mature. The three forms were over-expressed as inclusion bodies. Highly purified inclusion bodies were solubilized in a solution containing guanidine hydrochloride and the reducing agent DTT. Refolding (indicated by a dimer formation) of precursor myostatin, mature myostatin or a mixture of prodomain and mature myostatin was compared under identical refolding conditions, performed in a solution containing sodium chloride, arginine, a low concentration of guanidine hydrochloride and reduced and oxidized glutathione at 4 degrees C for 14 days. While precursor myostatin formed a reversible disulfide bond with no apparent precipitation, mature myostatin precipitated in the same refolding solution, unless CHAPS was included, and only a small proportion formed a disulfide bond. The trans presence of the prodomain in the refolding solution prevented precipitation of mature myostatin but did not promote formation of a dimer. Proteolytic cleavage of purified, refolded precursor myostatin with furin yielded a monomeric prodomain and a disulfide-linked, homodimeric mature myostatin, which remained as a latent complex. Activation of the latent complex was achieved by acidic or thermal treatments. These results demonstrate that the cis presence of the prodomain is essential for the proper refolding of fish myostatin and that the cleaved mature dimer exists as a latent form."
0,"Schizopygopsis pylzovi, an endemic fish of the subfamily Schizothoracinae, is comparatively well adapted to dissolved oxygen fluctuations in the aqueous environments of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Here, we cloned the complete cDNA of cytoglobin 1 and 2 (Cygb1 and Cygb2) from S. pylzovi and then investigated transcriptional changes of both genes in the selected tissues in response to hypoxia. Both the two genes had the standard exon-intron structure of vertebrate Mb genes but lacked an exon at downstream of the H helix (HC11.2) as seen in mammals. We applied severe hypoxia (4 h at PO<sub>2</sub> = 3.6% saturation) and moderate hypoxia (72 h at PO<sub>2</sub> = 36.0% saturation) to adult S. pylzovi. Under severe hypoxia, the Cygb1 mRNA levels decreased significantly in the liver, kidney, and brain, but increased significantly in the heart, while the Cygb2 mRNA levels downregulated significantly in the muscle and liver. But, the transcriptional activity of Cygb1 in muscle and that of Cygb2 in the kidney, brain, and heart remained almost unchanged. Under moderate hypoxia, the transcriptional activities of both genes in muscle and brain were turned down quickly after onset hypoxia, while in the liver, kidney, and heart, the transcriptional activities of both genes showed a short-term upregulation in different time periods of hypoxia exposure. Our data suggest that both the Cygb1 and Cygb2 in S. pylzovi are hypoxia-induced genes, and the responses of the transcription regulation of Cygb1 and Cygb2 genes to hypoxia are tissue specific and also depend on the hypoxia regime, which are different from that of other fish species."
0,"Acid and/or alkaline solubilization is a recent method developed to separate proteins from muscle foods with good functional properties. However, exposure of the muscle and its components to low pH values has been shown to promote lipid oxidation, limiting therefore the applications of this novel method. This research aimed primarily to study the physicochemical changes of the fish membranes brought about during acid or alkali solubilization processes. The effect on lipid oxidation and the possible role of the water soluble fraction of the muscle (press juice) as a potent antioxidant were also investigated. Model systems comprising minced cod muscle or cod microsomal suspensions were used. Results showed that acid or alkaline treatment (pH < 3.5 or pH > 10.5) of cod membranes significantly delayed lipid oxidation. Added triacylglycerols to washed cod system treated at low pH did not enhance hemoglobin-mediated lipid oxidation. Decreased precipitation of hemoglobin was observed with the alkali-treated membranes at all protein concentrations compared to the acid-treated and the untreated membranes. Finally, the addition of press juice to washed cod muscle tissue or to the membrane model system, significantly delayed hemoglobin lipid oxidation."
1,"The results of this study can be used to improve pH-shifting technologies to avoid or decrease lipid oxidation problems. Also, the use of press-juice from cod muscle as means of protecting the muscle against lipid oxidation is suggested."
0,"Remodeling the muscle metabolic machinery in mammals in response to energetic challenges depends on the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its ability to phosphorylate PPAR γ coactivator 1 α (PGC1α), which in turn coactivates metabolic genes through direct and indirect association with DNA-binding proteins such as the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) (Wu et al., 1999). The integrity of this axis in fish is uncertain because PGC1α i) lacks the critical Thr177 targeted by AMPK and ii) has mutations that may preclude binding NRF1. In this study we found no evidence that AMPK regulates mitochondrial gene expression through PGC1α in zebrafish and goldfish. AICAR treatment of zebrafish blastula cells increased phosphorylation of AMPK and led to changes in transcript levels of the AMPK targets mTOR and hexokinase 2. However, we saw no increases in mRNA levels for genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis, including PGC1α, NRF1, and COX7C, a cytochrome c oxidase subunit. Further, AMPK phosphorylated mammalian peptides of PGC1α but not the corresponding region of zebrafish or goldfish in vitro. In vivo cold acclimation of goldfish caused an increase in mitochondrial enzymes, AMP and ADP levels, however AMPK phosphorylation decreased. In fish, the NRF1-PGC1α axis may be disrupted due to insertions in fish PGC1α orthologs within the region that serves as NRF1 binding domain in mammals. Immunocopurification showed that recombinant NRF1 protein binds mammalian but not fish PGC1α. Collectively, our studies suggest that fish have a disruption in the AMPK-PGC1α-NRF1 pathway due to structural differences between fish and mammalian PGC1α. "
0,"Fatty acid metabolism is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis in aquatic vertebrates experiencing environmental stress. Both sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) are the key regulators of fatty acid metabolism. In this study, the coding sequences (CDS) of SREBP-1 and PPARα were firstly identified and characterized from Onychostoma macrolepis, encoding peptides of 1136 and 470 amino acids, respectively. The functional domains in O. macrolepis SREBP-1 and PPARα proteins retained the high similarity with those of other animals, at 74.69% and 77.29%, respectively. The mRNA encoding SREBP-1 was primarily expressed in the muscle and PPARα was highly expressed in the liver and intestine. Under thermal exposure, the content of non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) decreased gradually after 1 h in the liver and muscle of O. macrolepis, which might be due to that the organism meet more energy expenditure via fatty acid β-oxidation. Furthermore, the mRNA expression level of SREBP-1 decreased, while the mRNA expression level of PPARα increased from 0 h to 6 h in the liver. And we found that the mRNA expression levels of both SREBP-1 and PPARα decreased significantly at 48 h (P < .05) in the muscle, which was in accordance with the significant decrease of target gene FAS and CPT1A mRNA expression levels, respectively. It might be the physiological adjustment that the fish adapted to thermal exposure at the end of experiment. These results illustrate that O. macrolepis SREBP-1 and PPARα-mediated fatty acid metabolism is a fundamental requirement for thermal adaptation."
0,"Body deformity occurs both in wild and farmed fishes, which is one of the most challenging problems for aquaculture industry. In most cases, such body deformities are linked to skeletal deformities. Currently, very limited information is available on skeletal deformities of farmed fish species which may be caused by genetic factor. In this study, we performed muscle and vertebra transcriptome analyses in body deformity and normality of bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (from one meiotic gynogenesis family) using RNA-Seq. A total of 43,923 and 44,416 unigenes were predicted in muscles and vertebrae, respectively. Based on these data, we further explored the gene expression profiles in gynogenetic normal and abnormal bighead carp. No differentially expressed gene (DEG) was found in transcriptome data of muscles. Totally, 20 key DEGs were identified in transcriptome data of vertebrae, such as low density lipoprotein-related protein 2 (lrp2), bone morphogenetic protein 2B (bmp2b) and collagen alpha-1(IV) (col4a1). 12 potential pathways were also identified in vertebra transcriptome data, which were mainly involved in development, growth, cytoskeleton and energy metabolism, such as MAPK signaling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton and TGF-beta signaling pathway. Results of this study will be informative for the understanding of genetic mechanisms for body shape formation and also provide potential candidate genes for selection program involved in body shape and skeletal development in H. nobilis."
0,"Myostatin (MSTN) is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. In contrast to mammals, fish possess at least two paralogs of MSTN: MSTN-1 and MSTN-2. In this study, we analyzed the structural-functional features of the four variants of Sparus aurata MSTN-2 5'-flanking region: saMSTN-2a, saMSTN-2as, saMSTN-2b and saMSTN-2c. In silico analysis revealed numerous putative cis regulatory elements including several E-boxes known as binding sites to myogenic transcription factors. Transient transfection experiments using non-muscle and muscle cell lines showed surprisingly high transcriptional activity in muscle cells, suggesting the presence of regulatory elements unique to differentiated myotubes. These observations were confirmed by in situ intramuscular injections of promoter DNA followed by reporter gene assays. Moreover, high promoter activity was found in differentiated neural cell, in agreement with MSTN-2 expression in brain. Progressive 5'-deletion analysis, using reporter gene assays, showed that the core promoter is located within the first -127 bp upstream of the ATG, and suggested the presence of regulatory elements that either repress or induce transcriptional activity. Transient transgenic zebrafish provided evidence for saMSTN-2 promoter ability to direct GFP expression to myofibers. Finally, our data shows that although no mature saMSTN-2 mRNA is observed in muscle; unspliced forms accumulate, confirming high level of transcription. In conclusion, our study shows for the first time that MSTN-2 promoter is a very robust promoter, especially in muscle cells."
0,"The classical notion of a centralized clock that governs circadian rhythmicity has been challenged with the discovery of peripheral oscillators that enable organisms to cope with daily changes in their environment. The present study aimed to identify the molecular clock components in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and to investigate their daily gene expression in fast skeletal muscle. Atlantic cod clock genes were closely related to their orthologs in teleosts and tetrapods. Synteny was conserved to varying degrees in the majority of the 18 clock genes examined. In particular, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like 2 (arntl2), RAR-related orphan receptor A (rora) and timeless (tim) displayed high degrees of conservation. Expression profiling during the early ontogenesis revealed that some transcripts were maternally transferred, namely arntl2, cryptochrome 1b and 2 (cry1b and cry2), and period 2a and 2b (per2a and per2b). Most clock genes were ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, suggesting the possible existence of multiple peripheral clock systems in Atlantic cod. In particular, they were all detected in fast skeletal muscle, with the exception of neuronal PAS (Per-Arnt-Single-minded) domain-containing protein (npas1) and rora. Rhythmicity analysis revealed 8 clock genes with daily rhythmic expression, namely arntl2, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (clock), npas2, cry2, cry3 per2a, nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (nr1d1), and nr1d2a. Transcript levels of the myogenic genes myogenic factor 5 (myf5) and muscleblind-like 1 (mbnl1) strongly correlated with clock gene expression. This is the first study to unravel the molecular components of peripheral clocks in Atlantic cod. Taken together, our data suggest that the putative clock system in fast skeletal muscle of Atlantic cod has regulatory implications on muscle physiology, particularly in the expression of genes related to myogenesis.

0,"This study investigated the effect of ultrasound-assisted immersion freezing (UIF) at different ultrasonic power levels on the myofibrillar protein primary, secondary and tertiary structures of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Furthermore, protein thermal stability, electrophoresis pattern, and microstructure of the muscle tissue were also studied. Compared with a control, an ultrasonic power of less than 175 W had no significant negative effect on protein primary structure (P > 0.05), including total sulfhydryl, reactive sulfhydryl, carbonyl groups, free amino groups, dityrosine content, and surface hydrophobicity. UIF at 175 W (UIF-175) minimized the changes in protein secondary and tertiary structures. There were no obvious changes in the SDS-PAGE patterns of the control and frozen sample proteins. Microstructure analysis showed that an appropriate ultrasonic power (UIF-175) promoted the formation of smaller and more uniform ice crystals, reduced the damage of muscle tissue by ice crystals, and maintained the sarcomere integrity. In addition, UIF-175 samples had higher protein thermal stability. Overall, ultrasound treatment at a proper power (UIF-175) effectively minimized the changes in protein structure and protected the protein thermal stability during freezing process."
0,"Although indigenous climbing perch (Anabas testudineusis) is a highly valuable species, slow growth pattern during the culture period impeding its commercial success in aquaculture. In many fish species, it has been demonstrated that incubation temperature of eggs influenced the muscle development and growth rates, which persisted throughout the subsequent larval and juvenile phases. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether different incubation temperature of eggs prior to hatching can stimulate the muscle development, growth, and growth-related gene expression of the slow-growing indigenous species of climbing perch. The fertilized eggs of A. testudineus from an artificial breeding program were incubated under control temperature of 24 °C (IT24), 26 °C (IT26), 28 °C (IT28), and 30 °C (IT30) in 10L glass aquaria with four replicated units for each temperature treatment. After hatching, the larvae from each incubated temperature were separately reared at ambient temperature for 10 days in aquarium, 20 days in hapas, and the next 42 days in cages, totaling 72 days post-hatching (dph). The hatching rates were found significantly (P < 0.05) higher in IT28 compared to the other incubation temperature treatments. After 72 dph, the growth performances (%length gained, %weight gained and SGR) were found to be significantly highest (P < 0.05) in the IT28, followed by the treatments IT30, IT26, and IT24, respectively. Survival rate (73 ± 1.257%) was also found to be highest in the same treatment. The rate of new muscle fiber formation was identified to be significantly highest (P < 0.05) in IT28 followed by the IT26, IT30 and IT24, respectively. The relative mRNA expression level of GHRH, IGF1, IGF2 and PRL was also significantly highest in the IT28 (P < 0.05) compared to other treatments. Results from the present study clearly suggested that 28 °C is the optimum eggs incubation temperature of the native strain of A. testudineus for its highest growth performances in captive breeding condition."
0,"Myoglobins (Mb) are ubiquitous proteins found in striated muscle of nearly all vertebrate taxa. Although their function is most commonly associated with facilitating oxygen storage and diffusion, Mb has also been implicated in cellular antioxidant defense. The oxidized (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) form of Mb (metMB) can react with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to produce ferrylMb. FerrylMb can be reduced back to metMb for another round of reaction with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In the present study, we have shown that horse skeletal muscle Mb displays peroxidase activity using 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as reducing substrates, as well as the biologically-relevant substrates NADH/NADPH, ascorbate, caffeic acid, and resveratrol. We have also shown that ferrylMb can be reduced by both ethanol and acetaldehyde, which are known to accumulate in some vertebrate tissues under anaerobic conditions, such as anoxic goldfish and crucian carp, implying a potential mechanism for ethanol detoxification in striated muscle. We found that metMb peroxidase activity is pH-dependent, increasing as pH decreases from 7.4 to 6.1, which is biologically relevant to anaerobic vertebrate muscle when incurring intracellular lactic acidosis. Finally, we found that metMb reacts with hypochlorite in a heme-dependent fashion, indicating that Mb could play a role in hypochlorite detoxification. Taken together, these data suggest that Mb peroxidase activity might be an important antioxidant mechanism in vertebrate cardiac and skeletal muscle under a variety of physiological conditions, such as those that might occur in contracting skeletal muscle or during hypoxia."
0,"To understand the regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (Gcr) during loading and transport stress in fish, the Gcr gene of Coilia nasus was cloned. Gcr in C. nasus is expressed strongly in the liver and muscle, and less stronglyin the gills, brain, spleen, intestine, trunk kidney, and head kidney. Gcr expression in both the liver and muscle was increased by loading and transport stress. NaCl reduced the death rate caused by loading and transport stress, and the expression of Gcr in liver and muscle differed significantly between the NaCl and non-NaCl groups. To investigate whether the elevated Gcr transcripts were translated into protein, proteins extracted from the liver and muscle were analyzed. In both tissues, C. nasus GCR protein expression patterns paralleled those of Gcr mRNA during stress."
0,"Animals perform a remarkable diversity of movements through the coordinated mechanical contraction of skeletal muscle. This capacity for a wide range of movements is due to the presence of muscle cells with a very plastic phenotype that display many different biochemical, physiological and morphological properties. What factors influence the maintenance and plasticity of differentiated muscle fibers is a fundamental question in muscle biology. We have exploited the remarkable potential of skeletal muscle cells of the gymnotiform electric fish Sternopygus macrurus to trans-differentiate into electrocytes, the non-contractile electrogenic cells of the electric organ (EO), to investigate the mechanisms that regulate the skeletal muscle phenotype. In S. macrurus, mature electrocytes possess a phenotype that is intermediate between muscle and non-muscle cells. How some genes coding for muscle-specific proteins are downregulated while others are maintained, and novel genes are upregulated, is an intriguing problem in the control of skeletal muscle and EO phenotype. To date, the intracellular and extracellular factors that generate and maintain distinct patterns of gene expression in muscle and EO have not been defined. Expression studies in S. macrurus have started to shed light on the role that transcriptional and post-transcriptional events play in regulating specific muscle protein systems and the muscle phenotype of the EO. In addition, these findings also represent an important step toward identifying mechanisms that affect the maintenance and plasticity of the muscle cell phenotype for the evolution of highly specialized non-contractile tissues."
0,"Marinesco-Sjögren Syndrome (MSS) is a rare neuromuscular condition caused by recessive mutations in the SIL1 gene resulting in the absence of functional SIL1 protein, a co-chaperone for the major ER chaperone, BiP. As BiP is decisive for proper protein processing, loss of SIL1 results in the accumulation of misshaped proteins. This accumulation likely damages and destroys cells in vulnerable tissues, leading to congenital cataracts, cerebellar ataxia, vacuolar myopathy and other MSS phenotypes. Whether the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is affected in MSS has not been conclusively shown."
1,"To study PNS vulnerability in MSS, intramuscular nerves fibres from MSS patients and from SIL1-deficient mice (woozy) as well as sciatic nerves and neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) from these mice have been investigated via transmission electron microscopic and immunofluorescence studies accompanied by transcript studies and unbiased proteomic profiling. In addition, PNS and NMJ integrity were analyzed via immunofluorescence studies in an MSS-zebrafish model which has been generated for that purpose."
2,"Electron microscopy revealed morphological changes indicative of impaired autophagy and mitochondrial maintenance in distal axons and in Schwann cells. Moreover, changes of the morphology of NMJs as well as of transcripts encoding proteins important for NMJ function were detected in woozy mice. These findings were in line with a grossly abnormal structure of NMJs in SIL1-deficient zebrafish embryos. Proteome profiling of sciatic nerve specimens from woozy mice revealed altered levels of proteins implicated in neuronal maintenance suggesting the activation of compensatory mechanisms."

0,"Half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) is an important economic fish species cultured in northern China. In this study, we identified and analyzed the expression and function of a megalocytivirus-induced gene, CsMig1, from tongue sole. The deduced amino acid sequence of CsMig1 is composed of 507 residues and contains no conserved domains. Blast analysis identified no close homologues of CsMig1. CsMig1 shares moderate sequence similarities in the N-terminal region with the Gig1 (i.e., grass carp hemorrhagic virus-induced gene) homologues of several teleost species. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis showed that constitutive CsMig1 expression occurred, in increasing order, in heart, spleen, muscle, kidney, liver, gill, and gut. Experimental infection with the viral pathogen megalocytivirus upregulated CsMig1 expression in kidney, spleen, and liver in time-dependent manners. Treatment of head kidney lymphocytes with the culture supernatant of megalocytivirus-stimulated cells significantly enhanced CsMig1 expression. When head kidney lymphocytes were transfected with the plasmid that constitutively expresses CsMig1, the cells exhibited significantly increased ability to resist megalocytivirus infection. Taken together, these results indicate that CsMig1 is a virus- and, possibly, interferon-induced novel immune factor that functions in the antiviral immunity of tongue sole."
0,"Cell-cycle checkpoint proteins maintain genomic integrity by sensing damaged DNA and initiating DNA repair or apoptosis. RAD1 is a checkpoint protein involved in the sensing of damaged DNA and is a part of the 9-1-1 complex. In this project rainbow trout rad1 (rtrad1) was cloned, sequenced, expressed as a recombinant protein and anti-rtRAD1 antibodies were developed. RAD1 protein levels were characterized in various rainbow trout tissues. It was determined that an 840 bp open-reading frame encodes 279 aa with a predicted protein size of 31 kDa. The rtRAD1 amino-acid sequence is highly conserved and contains conserved exonuclease and leucine zipper domains. RT-PCR was used to identify three non-canonical splice variants of rtrad1, two of which are capable of forming functional proteins. The rad1 splice variant that encodes an 18 kDa protein appears to be abundant in rainbow trout spleen, heart and gill tissue and in the RTgill-W1 cell-line. Based on the genomic rtrad1 sequence the splice variants contain only partial exons which are consistent with the splicing of rad1 variants in mammals. This is the first time that rad1 has been fully characterized in a fish species."
0,"PAX are important regulators of developmental processes. PAX7 plays crucial roles in patterning of the dorsal central nervous system (CNS), neural crest (NC), and skeletal muscle. Here, we identified six spliced isoforms of pax7a and one pax7b and characterized their expression patterns. All of flounder Pax7a-1, Pax7a-2, Pax7a-3, and Pax7b contain a conserved paired domain (PD), an octapeptide motif (OP), and a paired type homeodomain (HD). However, the PD of Pax7a-4 and the HD of Pax7a-5 are not intact, and there is no HD in Pax7a-4 and Pax7a-6. pax7a and pax7b show distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns during embryogenesis. Whole-mount in situ hybridization demonstrates that the expression patterns of pax7a and pax7b are overlapping but distinguishable in the dorsal central nervous system. pax7a is expressed in most part of the brain and the neural tube, while pax7b is expressed exclusively in the diencephalon and the midbrain. In addition, pax7a is also expressed in the cranial NC and the trunk NC. RT-PCR results show that there were different expression patterns between the different isoforms. These results indicate subfunction partitioning of the duplicated pax7 genes. The duplicated pax7 may provide additional flexibility in fine-tuning neurogenesis and somitogenesis. "
0,"The construction of wind farms introduces artificial hard substrates in sandy sediments. As Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and pouting (Trisopterus luscus) tend to aggregate in order to feed around these reefs, energy profiling and trophic markers were applied to study their feeding ecology in a wind farm in the Belgian part of the North Sea. The proximate composition (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) differed significantly between liver and muscle tissue but not between fish species or between their potential prey species. Atlantic cod showed to consume more energy than pouting. The latter had a higher overall energy reserve and can theoretically survive twice as long on the available energy than cod. In autumn, both fish species could survive longer on their energy than in spring. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were found in high concentrations in fish liver. The prey species Jassa and Pisidia were both rich in EPA while Jassa had a higher DHA content than Pisidia. Energy profiling supported the statement that wind farm artificial reefs are suitable feeding ground for both fish species. Sufficient energy levels were recorded and there is no indication of competition."
0,"The washing operation of fish muscle is one of the key steps in the production of surimi. The aim of this study was to assess in parasitised minced fish the effect of the washing steps on the allergen removal of Anisakis simplex and on protein yield during surimi processing. Experimentally infected hake (Merluccius merluccius) (50 Anisakis simplex s.s L3 larvae per 100 g of muscle) underwent three successive washing steps with water, phosphate buffer (20 mmol L(-1) ), sodium bicarbonate (60 mmol L(-1) ), or sodium hypochlorite (0.27 mmol L(-1) ) in the surimi processing (4 kg muscle, 1:4 w/v for each solution). Total protein concentration and A. simplex antigens and allergens were evaluated in each waste fraction."
1,"The highest removal of Ani s 4 and A. simplex antigens was achieved by using phosphate buffer, together with a good protein yield in the raw surimi. Decrease of the concentration of allergens and antigens as a function of the washing steps rendered a linear trend (R(2) = 0.95 and 0.98 for Ani s 4 and A. simplex antigens, respectively)."

0,"The characterization of cholinesterase activity in brain and muscle of gilthead seabream was carried out using four specific substrates and three selective inhibitors. In addition, K <sub>m</sub> and V <sub>max</sub> were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation for ASCh and BSCh substrates. Finally, the in vitro sensitivity of brain and muscle cholinesterases to three organophosphates (OPs) was also investigated by estimating inhibition kinetics. The results indicate that AChE is the enzyme present in the brain, whereas in muscle, a typical AChE form is present along with an atypical form of BChE. Very low ChE activity was found in plasma with all substrates used. The inhibitory potency of the studied OPs on brain and muscle AChEs based on bimolecular inhibition constants (k <sub>i</sub> ) was: omethoate < dichlorvos < azinphosmethyl-oxon. Furthermore, muscle BChE was found to be several orders of magnitude (from 2 to 4) more sensitive than brain and muscle AChE inhibition by dichlorvos and omethoate."
0,"The aim of this study was to assess in an integrative manner the physiological regulation of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in gilthead sea bream. A contig of 1,325 nucleotides in length with an open reading frame of 307 amino acids was recognized as UCP2 after searches in our transcriptome reference database ( http://www.nutrigroup-iats.org/seabreamdb ). Gene expression mapping by quantitative real-time PCR revealed a ubiquitous profile that clearly differs from that of UCP1 and UCP3 variants with the greatest abundance in liver and white skeletal muscle, respectively. The greatest abundance of UCP2 transcripts was found in the heart, with a relatively high expression level in blood cells, where UCP1 and UCP3 transcripts were practically undetectable. Functional studies revealed that UCP2 mRNA expression remains either unaltered or up-regulated upon feed restriction in glycolytic (white skeletal muscle) and highly oxidative muscle tissues (heart and red skeletal muscle), respectively. In contrast, exposure to hypoxic conditions (18-19% oxygen saturation) markedly down-regulated the UCP2 mRNA expression in blood cells in a cellular environment with increased haematocrit, blood haemoglobin content, and circulating levels of glucose and lactate, and total plasma antioxidant activity. These findings demonstrated that UCP2 expression is highly regulated at the transcriptional level, arising this UCP variant as an important piece of the complex trade-off between metabolic and redox sensors. This feature would avoid the activation of futile cycles of energy wastage if changes in tissue oxidative and antioxidant metabolic capabilities are able to maintain the production of reactive oxygen species at a low regulated level."

Gene mutations causing HCM have been found in about half of HCM patients, while the genetic etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown for many cases of HCM. To identify novel mechanisms underlying HCM pathogenesis, we generated a cardiovascular-mutant medaka fish, <i>non-spring heart</i> (<i>nsh</i>), which showed diastolic dysfunction and hypertrophic myocardium. The <i>nsh</i> homozygotes had fewer myofibrils, disrupted sarcomeres and expressed pathologically stiffer titin isoforms. In addition, the <i>nsh</i> heterozygotes showed M-line disassembly that is similar to the pathological changes found in HCM. Positional cloning revealed a missense mutation in an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain located in the M-line-A-band transition zone of titin. Screening of mutations in 96 unrelated patients with familial HCM, who had no previously implicated mutations in known sarcomeric gene candidates, identified two mutations in Ig domains close to the M-line region of titin. <i>In vitro</i> studies revealed that the mutations found both in medaka fish and in familial HCM increased binding of titin to muscle-specific ring finger protein 1 (MURF1) and enhanced titin degradation by ubiquitination. These findings implicate an impaired interaction between titin and MURF1 as a novel mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HCM."
0,"Myosin heavy chains (MYHs) play important roles in muscle growth and contraction. In fish, MYHs contribute to hyperplasia and hypertrophy of muscle fibers, which can continue into adult life and thus result in indeterminate growth in some species. We previously identified two MYH genes, MYH-7a and MYH-7b, that are differentially expressed in Mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) and appear to function in early growth. However, the regulatory role of their 5' flanking regions is unknown. To examine the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these regions, we used genome walking to amplify their flanking sequences and analyzed the regulatory elements and binding sites. A single SNP locus was found in the flanking sequence of each gene. These SNP loci are located in the conserved glucocorticoid receptor binding region (MYH-7a: G-614A; Allele frequency: G:A = 94.9:5.1; GG (89.76) and AG (10.24) genotypes) and the LIM homeobox domain transcription factor binding sequence (MYH-7b: C-1933A; Allele frequency: C:A = 54.8:45.2; AA (20.82), AC (48.81), and CC (30.37) genotypes). At the G-614A loci, the GG genotype exhibited more superior growth traits (total length, body length, body height, etc.) than the AG genotype, with the exception of caudal peduncle length. Alternatively, at the C-1933A loci, the AC and AA genotypes showed significant differences in all growth traits, except for head length, with AC exhibiting superior traits. The AA and CC genotypes showed significant differences in caudal peduncle length and height, while no differences were observed between the AC and CC genotypes. Thus, these SNPs in the 5' flanking regions of MYH-7a and MYH-7b are correlated with superior growth and can be used for selecting Mandarin fish during breeding."
0,"Grouper (Epinephelus spp.) is a group of fish species with great economic importance in Asian countries. A novel hybrid grouper, generated by us and called the Hulong grouper (Hyb), has better growth performance than its parents, E. fuscoguttatus (Efu, ♀) and E. lanceolatus (Ela, ♂). We previously reported that the GH/IGF (growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor) system in the brain and liver contributed to the superior growth of the Hyb. In this study, using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we analyzed RNA expression levels of comprehensive genes in the muscle of the hybrid and its parents. Our data showed that genes involved in glycolysis and calcium signaling in addition to troponins are up-regulated in the Hyb. The results suggested that the activity of the upstream GH/IGF system in the brain and liver, along with the up-regulated glycolytic genes as well as ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and troponins related to the calcium signaling pathway in muscle, led to enhanced growth in the hybrid grouper. Muscle contraction inducing growth could be the major contributor to the growth superiority in our novel hybrid grouper, which may be a common mechanism for hybrid superiority in fishes."
0,"Interacting effects of feeding and stress on corticoid responses in fish were investigated in common carp fed 3.0% or 0.5% body mass (BM) which received no implant, a sham or a cortisol implant (250 mg/kg BM) throughout a 168 hour post-implant period (168 h-PI). At 12h-PI, cortisol implants elevated plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate. Plasma osmolality and ions remained stable, but cortisol increased gill and kidney Na(+)/K(+) ATPase (NKA) and H(+) ATPase activities. Gill NKA activities were higher at 3%-BM, whereas kidney H(+) ATPase activity was greater at 0.5%-BM. Cortisol induced liver protein mobilization and repartitioned liver and muscle glycogen. At 3%-BM, this did not increase plasma ammonia, reflecting improved excretion efficiency concomitant with upregulation of Rhesus glycoprotein Rhcg-1 in gill. Responses in glucocorticoid receptors (GR1/GR2) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) to cortisol elevation were most prominent in kidney with increased expression of all receptors at 24 h-PI at 0.5%-BM, but only GR2 and MR at 0.5%-BM. In the liver, upregulation of all receptors occurred at 24 h-PI at 3%-BM, whilst only GR2 and MR were upregulated at 0.5%-BM. In the gill, there was a limited upregulation: GR2 and MR at 72 h-PI and GR1 at 168 h-PI at 3%-BM but only GR2 at 72 h-PI at 0.5%-BM. Thus cortisol elevation led to similar expression patterns of cortisol receptors in both feeding regimes, while feeding affected the type of receptor that was induced. Induction of corticoid receptors occurred simultaneously with increases in Rhcg-1 mRNA expression (gill) but well after NKA and H(+) ATPase activities increased (gill/kidney)."
0,"We isolated and characterised a cDNA encoding the aspartic protease cathepsin E (CTSE) in Korean rose bitterling, Rhodeus uyekii. The full-length Rhodeus uyekii CTSE (RuCTSE) cDNA (1396 bp) contains an open reading frame of 1218 bp, encoding 405 amino acids. Alignment of multiple CTSE protein sequences revealed that two of the aspartyl protease active site residues and a disulphide bond were well-conserved among the other CTSE sequences. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RuCTSE is most closely related to freshwater fish cathepsin E. RuCTSE is widely expressed in the liver, spleen, ovary, testis, brain, eye, intestine, muscle, fin, stomach, and kidney. This first report of teleost CTSE will provide important information related to the identification of other cathepsin E genes in various fish species and will serve as a useful molecular tool to help clarify biological activities in other teleosts."
0,"Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) play a key role in mediating the host response against pathogen infection and other important biological processes. This is the first report of an IRF family member in blunt snout bream Megalobrama amblycephala. The complete cDNA of M. amblycephala (Ma) IRF1 gene has 1422 nucleotides (nt.), with an open reading frame of 858 nt, encoding a polypeptide of 285 amino acids. The putative MaIRF1 polypeptide shared significant structural homology with known IRF1 homologs: a conserved IRF domain was found at the N-terminal and an IRF association domain 2 at the C-terminal. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MaIRF1 amino acid sequence clustered with other teleost IRF1s, with a grass carp ortholog exhibiting the highest similarity. MaIRF1 mRNA expression patterns were studied using quantitative real-time PCR in healthy fish tissues and after a challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila bacterium. It was constitutively expressed in all examined tissues: the highest in blood, the lowest in muscle. The expression after A. hydrophila challenge was up-regulated in liver, spleen and kidney, but down-regulated in intestine and gills. At the protein level, similar expression patterns were observed in liver and gills. Patterns differed in intestine (up-regulation), spleen (down-regulation) and kidney (expression mostly unchanged). This study indicates that MaIRF1 gene plays an important role in the blunt snout bream immune system, hence providing an important base for further studies. "
0,"Chemokines are small cytokines that are classified into four groups, one of which is called CC chemokines. In the present study, the full-length cDNA of a CCL25 chemokine was identified from black rockfish, Sebastes schlegelii (named as SsCCL25) by EST (expressed sequence tag) analysis. The cDNA of SsCCL25 consisted of a 5-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 74 bp, a 3-UTR of 882 bp with a poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 303 bp encoding a polypeptide of 100 amino acids with the putative molecular mass of 11.5 kDa. There was a SCY domain in the deduced amino acid sequence of SsCCL25. The phylogenetic relationships and syntenic analyses provided evidences for the identities of SsCCL25 with CCL25 group. The mRNA transcripts of SsCCL25 were expressed in all detected tissues and dominantly in liver, muscle and gill. Moreover, after Vibrio anguillarum stimulation, the mRNA expression levels of SsCCL25 were significantly up-regulated at 24 h (p < 0.05) in the liver and during 4-8 h (p < 0.05) in the spleen. Recombinant SsCCL25 protein induced chemotaxis of both control and LPS-stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and enhanced their resistance to bacterial infection in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, rSsCCL25 showed significant inhibitory effect on V. anguillarum and Edwardsiella tarda growth. All these results collectively indicated that SsCCL25 might contribute to the defense against microbe infection and function as a chemoattractant in black rockfish."
0,"Over the last decades, climate change has intensified. Temperatures have increased and seawater has become ""fresher"" in Antarctica, affecting fish such as Harpagifer antarcticus. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate changes in the osmoregulatory response of the Antarctic notothenioid fish Harpagifer antarcticus and evaluate how it will cope with the future climate change and environmental conditions in the Antarctic, and in the hypothetical case that its geographical distribution will be extended to the Magellanes region. The present study was undertaken to determine the interaction between temperature and salinity tolerance (2 °C and 33 psu as the control group, the experimental groups were 5, 8, and 11 °C and 28 and 23 psu) and their effect on the osmoregulatory status of H. antarcticus. We evaluated changes in gill-kidney-intestine NKA activity, gene expression of NKAα, NKCC, CFTR, Aquaporins 1 and 8 in the same tissues, muscle water percentage, and plasma osmolality to evaluate osmoregulatory responses. Plasma osmolality decreased with high temperature, also the gill-kidney-intestine NKA activity, gene expression of NKA α, NKCC, CFTR, Aquaporins 1, and 8 were modified by temperature and salinity. We demonstrated that H. antarcticus can not live in the Magallanes region, due to its incapacity to put up with temperatures over 5 °C and with over 8 °C being catastrophic."
0,"Over the past 10 years we have been developing a multi-attribute analytical platform that allows for the preparation of milligram amounts of functional, high-pure, and stable Torpedo (muscle-type) nAChR detergent complexes for crystallization purpose. In the present work, we have been able to significantly improve and optimize the purity and yield of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in detergent complexes (nAChR-DC) without compromising stability and functionality. We implemented new methods in the process, such as analysis and rapid production of samples for future crystallization preparations. Native nAChR was extracted from the electric organ of Torpedo californica using the lipid-like detergent LysoFos Choline 16 (LFC-16), followed by three consecutive steps of chromatography purification. We evaluated the effect of cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) supplementation during the affinity purification steps of nAChR-LFC-16 in terms of receptor secondary structure, stability and functionality. CHS produced significant changes in the degree of β-secondary structure, these changes compromise the diffusion of the nAChR-LFC-16 in lipid cubic phase. The behavior was reversed by Methyl-β-Cyclodextrin treatment. Also, CHS decreased acetylcholine evoked currents of Xenopus leavis oocyte injected with nAChR-LFC-16 in a concentration-dependent manner. Methyl-β-Cyclodextrin treatment do not reverse functionality, however column delipidation produced a functional protein similar to nAChR-LFC-16 without CHS treatment."
0,"Intermuscular bones, ossified from tendons within the myosepta, occur only in teleost fish. Current understanding of the homology and origins of intermuscular bones in fishes is based mainly on morphological data. To date, there is no published data regarding molecular mechanisms of intermuscular bone formation. In this study, we cloned the gene muscle segment homeobox C (MsxC). MsxC potentially plays a role in intermuscular bone development of Hemibarbus labeo, an important species of cyprinid fish in the Chinese aquaculture industry. Sequence analysis of MsxC revealed motifs characteristic of the homeobox domain family. Whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that MsxC was primarily expressed in the myosepta and brain. MsxC was expressed in the myosepta from 26 to 41 days after hatching (DAH); this coincided with the onset of intermuscular bone ossification, which occurred between 35 and 62 DAH. Evidence for localization of MsxC expression by in situ hybridization correlated with its detection by quantitative real-time PCR. In vertebrates, MsxC plays a role in the regulation of mesenchymal cell differentiation during bone formation. We therefore conclude that MsxC may have a role in epithelium-mesenchyme interactions during intermuscular bone formation in H. labeo. "
0,"Growth hormone (GH) transgenesis results in increased growth, feed intake and consequent metabolic rates in fish, and alters the utilization of dietary and stored carbohydrates, lipid and protein. However, the manner in which GH transgenesis differentially alters these energy sources in fish has not been well explored. We examined the effects of GH transgenesis and dietary carbohydrate, lipid and protein levels on metabolic enzyme activity in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In white muscle, increased activities of glycolytic enzymes and decreased activities of lipolytic enzymes in transgenic fish indicate a sparing of lipids through the preferential use of carbohydrates for energy production. In liver, transgenic fish showed increased activity of lipid synthesis enzymes and a shift in amino acid metabolism from catabolic to synthetic roles, suggesting a larger emphasis on anabolic pathways in transgenic fish to support accelerated growth. Unlike nontransgenic fish, transgenic fish fed a diet high in carbohydrates maintained growth rates, had increased capacity for lipid synthesis, and increased potential for biosynthetic roles of amino acids. GH transgenesis influences metabolic reactions in coho salmon by emphasizing carbohydrate degradation for energy production and lipid synthesis, and increasing utilization of lipids and proteins for synthetic roles necessary to maintain accelerated growth."
0,"Fish consumption is one of the major ways through which humans receive exposure to mercury (Hg). The existing forms of Hg in food, particularly Hg bound to proteins, may affect the absorption of Hg by humans and subsequently its potentially toxic effects. However, the knowledge regarding Hg-binding proteins in edible fish muscle is scarce. In the present study, salmon and tuna fish muscles, collected from seven different regions and countries, were analyzed using metallomics- and proteomics-based techniques. The concentration of Hg in sashimi samples ranged from 4.4 to 317.4 ng/g. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) showed that beta-actin was a novel Hg-binding protein from the fish muscles, and this protein could also bind bismuth (Bi), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu). Hg bound to beta-actin accounted for approximately 30.2-37.6% of the total Hg in the tuna muscles and was significantly correlated to total Hg in the fish muscles (r = 0.98, p < 0.01) and in the fraction of soluble proteins (r = 0.94, p < 0.01). These findings suggest that proteins act as the main Hg accumulation sites in edible fish; thus, increasing human exposure to Hg following gastrointestinal digestion."
0,"Myoglobin is known to be present exclusively in cardiac and red skeletal muscles, but not in white skeletal muscles. Thus, to date, only a few studies on myoglobin from fish species with white flesh have been reported. For comparative examination, we directly isolated myoglobin from cardiac muscle of hoki (Macruronus magellanicus), one of the most important commercial fish species with white muscle. The ferrous myoglobin was separated from its ferric met-form by anion exchange column chromatography. The absorption spectra of hoki myoglobin were similar to those of bigeye tuna skeletal myoglobin, in both oxy- and met-forms. However, hoki oxymyoglobin was found to be susceptible to autoxidation in 0.1 M buffer (pH 7.2) at 25°C, with its rate being more than 3 times higher than that of bigeye tuna oxymyoglobin. "
0,"Grass carp reovirus strain 109 (GCReV-109) was previously isolated from a grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) with hemorrhagic disease, and its complete genome has been sequenced. However, the infectivity of GCReV-109 has not been studied, and the viral protein VP33, encoded on genome segment S11, had no detectable sequence homology to other known reovirus proteins. In this study, we characterized GCReV-109 infections in vivo and in vitro, as well as the VP33 protein. Infectivity analysis showed that GCReV-109 caused severe hemorrhagic disease and 100% mortality at dilutions up to 10(-4) in rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) by 8 days postinfection, but no visible cytopathic effect was observed in GCReV-109-infected subcultured grass carp muscle (GCM) cells. To confirm that GCReV-109 could be propagated in GCM cells, three virus genome segments were detected by RT-PCR, and large numbers of virus particles were observed by transmission electron microscopy in samples from the infected GCM cells. The suspension of GCReV-109-infected GCM cells was pathogenic to rare minnows. VP33 protein was expressed and purified for generation of an anti-VP33 antiserum. In western blot analysis of purified GCReV-109 particles, the antiserum specifically recognized a protein band (approximately 33 kDa). This revealed that VP33 is a major structural protein of GCReV-109 that might have immunogenic properties. The protective efficacy of the anti-VP33 antiserum against GCReV-109 infection was tested. The death of infected fish was delayed and the mortality fell to 10% when fish were treated with the anti-VP33 antiserum, suggesting that it might be useful for the prevention and control of fish reoviral disease."
0,"Muscle performance depends on the supply of metabolic fuels and disposal of end-products. Using circulating metabolite concentrations to infer changes in fluxes is highly unreliable because the relationship between these parameters varies greatly with physiological state. Quantifying fuel kinetics directly is therefore crucial to the understanding of muscle metabolism. This review focuses on how carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids are provided to fish muscles during hypoxia and swimming. Both stresses force white muscle to produce lactate at higher rates than it can be processed by aerobic tissues. However, lactate accumulation is minimized because disposal is also strongly stimulated. Exogenous supply shows that trout have a much higher capacity to metabolize lactate than observed during hypoxia or intense swimming. The low density of monocarboxylate transporters and their lack of upregulation with exercise explain the phenomenon of white muscle lactate retention. This tissue operates as a quasi-closed system, where glycogen stores act as an 'energy spring' that alternates between explosive power release during swimming and slow recoil from lactate in situ during recovery. To cope with exogenous glucose, trout can completely suppress hepatic production and boost glucose disposal. Without these responses, glycemia would increase four times faster and reach dangerous levels. The capacity of salmonids for glucoregulation is therefore much better than presently described in the literature. Instead of albumin-bound fatty acids, fish use lipoproteins to shuttle energy from adipose tissue to working muscles during prolonged exercise. Proteins may play an important role in fueling muscle work in fish, but their exact contribution is yet to be established. The membrane pacemaker theory of metabolism accurately predicts general properties of muscle membranes such as unsaturation, but it does not explain allometric patterns of specific fatty acids. Investigations of metabolic fuel kinetics carried out in fish to date have demonstrated that these ectotherms use several unique strategies to orchestrate energy supply to working muscles and to survive hypoxia.

0,"The gilthead seabream larval rearing in continuous light is common in most Mediterranean hatcheries to stimulate larval length growth and increase food consumption. Several studies have shown that continuous light affects larval development and increases the prevalence of skeletal deformities. Melatonin is a crucial pineal neurohormone that displays daily secretion patterns, stimulates cell proliferation and embryonic development in Atlantic salmon and zebrafish, and improves osseointegration in mice and humans. However, no studies have examined the effects of orally supplemented melatonin on skeletal deformities in <i>Sparus aurata</i> larvae. We administered exogenous melatonin to gilthead seabream larvae via enriched rotifers and nauplii of Artemia. Exogenous melatonin induced bone deformities and stimulated parathyroid hormone-related protein-coding gene (<i>PTHrP</i>) mRNA expression. In addition to the melatonin-induced <i>PTHrP</i> high expression level, the recorded non coordinated function of skeletal muscle and bone during growth can be the fountainhead of bone deformities. Both myosin light chain 2 (<i>mlc2</i>) and bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein-coding gene (<i>bglap</i>) expression levels were significantly affected by melatonin administration in an inverse dose-response manner during the exogenous melatonin administration. This is the first study to report the effect of inducing melatonin bone deformities on <i>Sparus aurata</i> larvae reared under ordinary hatchery conditions."
0,"(1) Background: l-leucine (Leu) plays a positive role in regulating protein turnover in skeletal muscle in mammal. However, the molecular mechanism for the effects of Leu on muscle growth and protein deposition is not clearly demonstrated in fish. This study investigated the effects of dietary Leu on growth performance and muscle growth, protein synthesis, and degradation-related signaling pathways of hybrid catfish (<i>Pelteobagrus vachelli</i>♀ × <i>Leiocassis longirostris</i>♂). (2) Methods: A total of 630 hybrid catfish (23.19 ± 0.20 g) were fed 6 different experimental diets containing graded levels of Leu at 10.0 (control), 15.0, 20.0, 25.0, 30.0, 35.0, and 40.0 g Leu kg<sup>-1</sup> for 8 weeks. (3) Results: Results showed that dietary Leu increased percent weight gain (PWG), specific growth rate (SGR), FI (feed intake), feed efficiency (FE), protein efficiency ratio (PER), muscle fibers diameter, and muscle fibers density; up-regulated insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), myogenic regulation factors (MyoD, Myf5, MyoG, and Mrf4), and MyHC mRNA levels; increased muscle protein synthesis via regulating the AKT/TOR signaling pathway; and attenuated protein degradation via regulating the AKT/FOXO3a signaling pathway. (4) Conclusions: These results suggest that Leu has potential role to improve muscle growth and protein deposition in fish, which might be due to the regulation of IGF mRNA expression, muscle growth related gene, and protein synthesis and degradation-related signaling pathways. Based on the broken-line model, the Leu requirement of hybrid catfish (23.19-54.55 g) for PWG was estimated to be 28.10 g kg<sup>-1</sup> of the diet (73.04 g kg<sup>-1</sup> of dietary protein). These results will improve our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for muscle growth and protein deposition effects of Leu in fish."
0,"Interleukin (IL)-22, as a member of the interleukin (IL)-10 family, is an important mediator between the immune cells and epithelial tissues during infection and inflammation. This study reported the characterization and mRNA expression patterns of Pf_IL-22 gene and its cell surface-associated receptors Pf_IL-22RA1 and soluble Pf_IL-22RA2 genes in yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus filvidraco). The open reading frames (ORFs) of the Pf_IL-22, Pf_IL-22RA1 and Pf_IL-22RA2 genes were 546 bp, 1740 bp and 690 bp in length, encoding 181, 579 and 229 amino acids, respectively. Alignments of the deduced amino acid sequences present that the Pf_IL-22 has a conserved IL-10 family signature motif, and the Pf_IL-22RA1 and Pf_IL-22RA2 have two conserved fibronectin type-III domains. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses showed that the Pf_IL-22 and Pf_IL-22RA1 mRNAs were highly expressed in mucosal tissues such as the fin, gill, intestine, skin mucus and stomach, and were weakly expressed in the kidney, liver and head kidney of adult yellow catfish, indicating that the Pf_IL-22 transcripts may be mainly produced by mucosal immune cells/tissues in healthy yellow catfish. The mRNA expression levels of the Pf_IL-22RA2 gene were high in the muscle and liver, and were relatively low in the spleen and kidney. The mRNA expression levels of the Pf_IL-22 and its two receptor genes were significantly up-regulated in both mucosal tissues (gill, hindgut, and skin mucus) and systemic immune tissues (spleen, head kidney and blood) after Edwardsiella ictaluri challenge. These results indicated that the Pf_IL-22 and its two receptors genes might play an important role in the innate immune defense against bacterial invasion."
0,"Human LYNX1, belonging to the Ly6/neurotoxin family of three-finger proteins, is membrane-tethered with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and modulates the activity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). Recent preparation of LYNX1 as an individual protein in the form of water-soluble domain lacking glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (ws-LYNX1; Lyukmanova, E. N., Shenkarev, Z. O., Shulepko, M.

P. (2011) NMR structure and action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of water-soluble domain of human LYNX1. J. Biol. Chem. 286, 10618-10627) revealed the attachment at the agonist-binding site in the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) and muscle nAChR but outside it, in the neuronal nAChRs. Here, we obtained a series of ws-LYNX1 mutants (T35A, P36A, T37A, R38A, K40A, Y54A, Y57A, K59A) and examined by radioligand analysis or patch clamp technique their interaction with the AChBP, Torpedo californica nAChR and chimeric receptor composed of the α7 nAChR extracellular ligand-binding domain and the transmembrane domain of α1 glycine receptor (α7-GlyR). Against AChBP, there was either no change in activity (T35A, T37A), slight decrease (K40A, K59A), and even enhancement for the rest mutants (most pronounced for P36A and R38A). With both receptors, many mutants lost inhibitory activity, but the increased inhibition was observed for P36A at α7-GlyR. Thus, there are subtype-specific and common ws-LYNX1 residues recognizing distinct targets. Because ws-LYNX1 was inactive against glycine receptor, its ""non-classical"" binding sites on α7 nAChR should be within the extracellular domain. Micromolar affinities and fast washout rates measured for ws-LYNX1 and its mutants are in contrast to nanomolar affinities and irreversibility of binding for α-bungarotoxin and similar snake α-neurotoxins also targeting α7 nAChR. This distinction may underlie their different actions, i.e. nAChRs modulation versus irreversible inhibition, for these two types of three-finger proteins."
0,"The skin of the fish is the foremost target of oxidative stress due to the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) originated in the environment and in the skin itself. In this study, a non-destructive assay was developed to evaluate the effects of crude oil (0.0001-0.1mg/L, 96h) on oxidative stress response in the Skin Mucus Layer (SML) of the dusky splitfin goodeid (Goodea gracilis). The response in the SML was compared with recognized target organs through the Integrated Biomarker Response (IBRv2) and a slight addition to the method was proposed. Crude oil was extremely toxic and elicited a clear induction of ROS in the SML, as in the brain, liver and muscle. By the exposure to crude, a significant change in the activities of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) as well as on lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and carbonyl protein (RCO) levels was detected. Also, increases in the activity of EROD were found. The general IBRv2 proposed in this study (gIBRv2) showed that oil causes the higher oxidative response in the SML (60.049) under different concentrations of petroleum, which was greater in the brain (56.749), muscle (56.561) and liver (55.775). The results of the study revealed an organ-specific antioxidant defense response that was dependent on the load of petroleum. These results contributed to the understanding of the complexity of oxidative stress response in fish exposed to crude oil using the Skin Mucus Layer as a target for environmental monitoring studies."
0,"Common carp is a widely cultivated fish with longer than 2,000 years domestication history, due to its strong environmental adaptabilities, especially hypoxia tolerance. The common carp genome has experienced a very recent whole genome duplication (WGD) event. Among a large number of highly similar duplicated genes, a pair of Ras-associated binding-GTPase 1a (Rab1a) genes were found fast diverging. Four analogous Rab1a genes were identified in the common carp genome. Comparisons of gene structures and sequences indicated Rab1a-1 and Rab1a-2 was a pair of fast diverging duplicates, while Rab1a-3 and Rab1a-4 was a pair of less diverged duplicates. All putative Rab1a proteins shared conserved GTPase domain, which enabled the proteins serve as molecular switches for vesicular trafficking. Rab1a-1 and Rab1a-2 proteins varied in their C-terminal sequences, which were generally considered to encode the membrane localization signals. Differential expression patterns were observed between Rab1a-1 and Rab1a-2 genes. In blood, muscle, spleen, and heart, the mRNA level of Rab1a-1 was higher than that of Rab1a-2. In liver and intestine, the mRNA level of Rab1a-2 was higher. Expression of Rab1a-1 and Rab1a-2 showed distinct hypoxia responses. Under severe hypoxia, Rab1a-1 expression was down-regulated in blood, while Rab1a-2 expression was up-regulated in liver. Compared with the less diverged Rab1a-3/4 gene pair, common carp Rab1a-1/2 gene pair exhibited strong characteristics of sub-functionalization, which might contribute to a sophisticated and efficient Ras-dependent regulating network for the hypoxia-tolerant fish.

0,"Understanding the mitochondrial processes that contribute to body energy metabolism may provide an attractive therapeutic target for obesity and co-morbidities. Here we investigated whether intermittent dietary supplementation with conjugated linoleic (CLA, 18:2n-6), docosahexaenoic (22:6n-3, DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (20:5n-3, EPA) acids, either alone or in combination, changes body metabolism associated with mitochondrial functions in the brain, liver, skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Male C57Bl/6 mice were divided into groups: CLA (50% cis-9, trans-11; 50% trans-10, cis-12), EPA/DHA (64% EPA; 28% DHA), CLA plus EPA/DHA or control (linoleic acid). Each mouse received 3 g/kg b.w. of the stated oil by gavage on alternating days for 60 days. Dietary supplementation with CLA or EPA/DHA increased body VO<sub>2</sub> consumption, VCO<sub>2</sub> production and energy expenditure, being fish oil (FO) the most potent even in combination with CLA. Individually, both oils reduced mitochondrial density in BAT. CLA supplementation alone also a) elevated the expression of uncoupling proteins in soleus, liver and hippocampus and the uncoupling activity in the last two, ad this effect was associated with reduced hydrogen peroxide production in hippocampus; b) increased proteins related to mitochondrial fission in liver. EPA/DHA supplementation alone also a) induced mitochondrial biogenesis in liver, soleus and hippocampus associated with increased expression of PGC1-α; b) induced proteins related to mitochondrial fusion in the liver, and fission and fusion in the hippocampus. Therefore, this study shows changes on mitochondrial mechanisms induced by CLA and/or EPA/DHA that can be associated with elevated body energy expenditure."

RNA was extracted from the pancreas, and cDNA was synthesized and later amplified by endpoint PCR using oligonucleotides designed from different try sequences of fish registered in GenBank. Subsequently, specific oligonucleotides were designed from the partial sequences. Gene expression was measured after RNA extraction and synthesis of the cDNA of 11 organs (liver, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, intestine, pyloric caeca, brain, muscle, gills, gonad, and kidney) of captive and wild adults. Likewise, samples of A. tropicus larvae were taken on days 0 (embryo), 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 days after hatching (DAH), the RNA was extracted, and the synthesis of cDNA was carried out to measure real-time gene expression (qPCR). The results showed that the highest relative try expression occurred mainly in the esophagus, liver, stomach, and pancreas of both wild and captive adult fish; however, captive organisms had a higher try expression level than wild fish. Although try expression during initial ontogeny was high in embryos (0 DAH), it did not reach the maximum value until 15 DAH. It was concluded that try expression levels in captive adults are due to the high protein content in the balanced feed (trout diet). The highest try expression level during larviculture was detected at 15 DAH, which indicates that A. tropicus larvae have a mature digestive system and can efficiently hydrolyze proteins from feed at this developmental stage."
0,"Myostatin (Mstn), a member of the transforming growth factor β superfamily, plays an inhibiting role in mammalian muscle growth. Mammals like human, cattle, mouse, sheep, and dog carrying null alleles of Mstn display a double-muscle phenotype. Mstn is conserved in fish; however, little is known whether the fish with mutated mstn display a similar phenotype to mammals because of the lack of mutant fish with mstn null alleles. Previously, we knocked out one of the duplicated copies of myostatin gene (mstna) in yellow catfish using zinc-finger nucleases. In this study, we report the identification of the second myostatin gene (mstnb) and knockout of mstnb in yellow catfish. The gene comprises three exons. It is predicted to encode 373 amino acid residues. The predicted protein exhibits 59.3% identity with yellow catfish Mstna and 57.3% identity with human MSTN. Employing TALEN (transcription activator-like effector nucleases) technology, we obtained two founders (from four randomly selected founders) of yellow catfish carrying the mutated mstnb gene in their germ cells. Totally, six mutated alleles of mstnb were obtained from the founders. Among the six alleles, four are nonframeshift and two are frameshift mutation. The frameshift mutated alleles include mstnb(nju22), an 8 bp deletion, and mstnb(nju24), a complex type of mutation comprising a 7 bp deletion and a 12 bp insertion. They are predicted to encode function null Mstnb. Our results will help to understand the roles of mstn genes in fish growth."
0,"Stac3 was identified as a nutritionally regulated gene from an Atlantic salmon subtractive hybridization library with highest expression in skeletal muscle. Salmon Stac3 mRNA was highly correlated with myogenin and myoD1a expression during differentiation of a salmon primary myogenic culture and was regulated by amino acid availability. In zebrafish embryos, stac3 was initially expressed in myotomal adaxial cells and in fast muscle fibers post-segmentation. Morpholino knockdown resulted in defects in myofibrillar protein assembly, particularly in slow muscle fibers, and decreased levels of the hedgehog receptor patched. The function of Stac3 was further characterized in vitro using the mammalian C2C12 myogenic cell line. Stac3 mRNA expression increased during the differentiation of the C2C12 myogenic cell line. Knockdown of Stac3 by RNAi inhibited myotube formation, and microarray analysis revealed that transcripts involved in cell cycle, focal adhesion, cytoskeleton, and the pro-myogenic factors Igfbp-5 and Igf2 were down-regulated. RNAi-treated cells had suppressed Akt signaling and exogenous insulin-like growth factor (Igf) 2 was unable to rescue the phenotype, however, Igf/Akt signaling was not blocked. Overexpression of Stac3, which results in increased levels of Igfbp-5 mRNA, did not lead to increased differentiation. In synchronized cells, Stac3 mRNA was most abundant during the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. RNAi-treated cells were smaller, had higher proliferation rates and a decreased proportion of cells in G(1) phase when compared with controls, suggesting a role in the G(1) phase checkpoint. These results identify Stac3 as a new gene required for myogenic differentiation and myofibrillar protein assembly in vertebrates."
0,"Large quantities of low-value protein rich co-products, such as salmon skin and trimmings, are generated annually. These co-products can be upgraded to high-value functional ingredients. The aim of this study was to assess the antidiabetic potential of salmon skin gelatin and trimmings-derived protein hydrolysates in vitro. The gelatin hydrolysate generated with Alcalase 2.4L and Flavourzyme 500L exhibited significantly higher (p < 0.001) insulin and GLP-1 secretory activity from pancreatic BRIN-BD11 and enteroendocrine GLUTag cells, respectively, when tested at 2.5 mg/mL compared to hydrolysates generated with Alcalase 2.4L or Promod 144MG. The gelatin hydrolysate generated with Alcalase 2.4L and Flavourzyme 500L showed significantly more potent (p < 0.01) DPP-IV inhibitory activity than those generated with Alcalase 2.4L or Promod 144MG. No significant difference was observed in the insulinotropic activity mediated by any of the trimmings-derived hydrolysates when tested at 2.5 mg/mL. However, the trimmings hydrolysate generated with Alcalase 2.4L and Flavourzyme 500L exhibited significantly higher DPP-IV inhibitory (p < 0.05:Alcalase 2.4L and p < 0.01:Promod 144MG) and GLP-1 (p < 0.001, 2.5 mg/mL) secretory activity than those generated with Alcalase 2.4L or Promod 144MG. The salmon trimmings hydrolysate generated with Alcalase 2.4L and Flavourzyme 500L when subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGID) was shown to retain its GLP-1 secretory and DPP-IV inhibitory activities, in addition to improving its insulin secretory activity. However, the gelatin hydrolysate generated with Alcalase 2.4L and Flavourzyme 500L was shown to lose GLP-1 secretory activity following SGID. A significant increase in membrane potential (p < 0.001) and intracellular calcium (p < 0.001) by both co-product hydrolysates generated with Alcalase 2.4L and Flavourzyme 500L suggest that both hydrolysates mediate their insulinotropic activity through the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel-dependent pathway. Additionally, by stimulating a significant increase in intracellular cAMP release (p < 0.05) it is likely that the trimmings-derived hydrolysate may also mediate insulin secretion through the protein kinase A pathway. The results presented herein demonstrate that salmon co-product hydrolysates exhibit promising in vitro antidiabetic activity."
0,"We investigated the effects of heat stress on genetically improved farmed tilapia, focusing on metabolic and immune responses. Differences in blood parameters, serum biochemistry, muscle fatty acid composition, and microRNA (miRNA) expression were analyzed in fish under heat stress. Fish were exposed to heat stress at 35 °C and sampled at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after exposure and compared with a control group maintained at 28 °C. The results showed that red and white blood cell counts, hemoglobin levels, and hematocrit values tended to increase (P < 0.05) and reached their maximum levels after 24 h, then declined. Acute heat stress enhanced serum glucose, total protein, and total cholesterol levels, and muscle fatty acid components were also altered. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was significantly increased after heat stress for 6 and 12 h. Polyunsaturated fatty acids levels were increased after heat stress for 12 and 24 h, whereas levels of monounsaturated fatty acids decreased in response to heat stress. Expression of hepatic miR-1 and miR-122 was significantly upregulated, and expression of miR-10c was significantly increased (P < 0.05) only after heat stress for 48 h. Acute heat stress altered metabolism closely related to the immune system and the liver of tilapia. These findings contribute to a theoretical framework for tilapia breeding at high temperatures."
0,"A tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) myosin light chain 3 (Mlc3) promoter region (~4.3 kb) was isolated and characterized. Sequence analysis of the clone revealed high similarity with a tilapia gene encoding the Mlc3 promoter region, exon 1, and intron 1. The clone contained several putative binding sequences for transcription factors, including MEF-2, MYOG, MyoD, PKNOX1, and AREB6. Deletion of a region of the tilapia Mlc3 promoter (801 to -3,881 bp) enhanced promoter activity, as determined by direct injection of a luciferase reporter construct into skeletal muscle of Archocentrus nigrofasciatus. These findings suggest that the region between -801 and -3,881 bp may contain negative regulatory elements. Stable germline transgenic strains of the ornamental fish species A. nigrofasciatus var. carrying the Taiwan coral red fluorescent protein (TcRFP) driven by the Mlc3 promoter were established. F1 adult transgenic A. nigrofasciatus var. exhibited brilliant pink fluorescence in skeletal muscles in the daylight. Therefore, our current study demonstrates the feasibility of using the tilapia Mlc3 promoter to drive fluorescence in new fish species, such as Perciformes. "
0,"Intermolecular interaction phenomena occurring between endogenous compounds, such as proteins and bile salts, and electrospun compounds are so far unreported, despite the exposure of fibers to such biorelevant compounds when applied for biomedical purposes, e.g., tissue engineering, wound healing, and drug delivery. In the present study, we present a systematic investigation of how surfactants and proteins, as physiologically relevant components, interact with insulin-loaded fish sarcoplasmic protein (FSP) electrospun fibers (FSP-Ins fibers) in solution and thereby affect fiber properties such as accessible surface hydrophilicity, physical stability, and release characteristics of an encapsulated drug. Interactions between insulin-loaded protein fibers and five anionic surfactants (sodium taurocholate, sodium taurodeoxycholate, sodium glycocholate, sodium glycodeoxycholate, and sodium dodecyl sulfate), a cationic surfactant (benzalkonium chloride), and a neutral surfactant (Triton X-100) were studied. The anionic surfactants increased the insulin release in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the neutral surfactant had no significant effect on the release. Interestingly, only minute amounts of insulin were released from the fibers when benzalkonium chloride was present. The FSP-Ins fibers appeared dense after incubation with this cationic surfactant, whereas high fiber porosity was observed after incubation with anionic or neutral surfactants. Contact angle measurements and staining with the hydrophobic dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid indicated that the FSP-Ins fibers were hydrophobic, and showed that the fiber surface properties were affected differently by the surfactants. Bovine serum albumin also affected insulin release in vitro, indicating that also proteins may affect the fiber performance in an in vivo setting."
0,"In vitro digestion products of proteins were compared among beef, pork, chicken, and fish. Gastric and jejunal contents from the rats fed these meat proteins were also compared. Cooked pork, beef, chicken, and fish were homogenized and incubated with pepsin alone or followed by trypsin. The digestion products with molecular weights of less than 3000 Da were identified with MALDI-TOF-MS and nano-LC-MS/MS. Gastric and jejunal contents obtained from the rats fed the four meat proteins for 7 days were also analyzed. After pepsin digestion, pork, and beef samples had a greater number of fragments in similarity than chicken and fish samples, but the in vitro digestibility was the greatest (p < 0.05) for pork and the smallest for beef samples. After trypsin digestion, the species differences were less pronounced (p > 0.05). A total of 822 and 659 peptides were identified from the in vitro and in vivo digestion products, respectively. Our results could interpret for the differences in physiological functions after the ingestion of different species of meat. "
0,"Nutritional control of gene regulation guides the transformation of smooth muscle cells (SMC) into foam cells in atherosclerosis. Oxidative stress has been reported in areas of lipid accumulation, activating proliferation genes. Suppression of oxidative stress by antioxidant administration reduces this activation and the progression of lesions. We hypothesized that fish oil consumption may protect against atherosclerotic vascular disease. The study objective was to determine the effects of dietary cholesterol and fish-oil intake on the apoptotic pathways induced by 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) in SMC cultures."
1,"An in vivo/in vitro cell model was used, culturing SMC isolated from chicks exposed to an atherogenic cholesterol-rich diet with 5% of cholesterol (SMC-Ch) alone or followed by an anti-atherogenic fish oil-rich diet with 10% of menhaden oil (SMC-Ch-FO) and from chicks on standard diet (SMC-C). Cells were exposed to 25-HC, studying apoptosis levels by flow cytometry (Annexin V) and expressions of caspase-3, c-myc, and p53 genes by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction."
2,"Exposure to 25-HC produced apoptosis in all three SMC cultures, which was mediated by increases in caspase-3, c-myc, and p53 gene expression. Changes were more marked in SMC-Ch than in SMC-C, indicating that dietary cholesterol makes SMC more susceptible to 25-HC-mediated apoptosis. Expression of p53 gene was elevated in SMC-Ch-FO. This supports the proposition that endogenous levels of p53 protect SMC against apoptosis and possibly against the development of atherosclerosis. Fish oil attenuated the increase in c-myc levels observed in SMC-C and SMC-Ch, possibly through its influence on the expression of antioxidant genes."
3,"Replacement of a cholesterol-rich diet with a fish oil-rich diet produces some reversal of the cholesterol-induced changes, increasing the resistance of SMC to apoptosis."
0,"A growing family of cellular proteins encoding for caspase activation and the recruitment domain (CARD) plays a crucial role in immunity by sensing viral infections and signaling antiviral immune defenses. We obtained a MAVS-like protein (named TnMAVS) from Tetradon nigroviridis, which contains a CARD domain, a pro-rich domain, and a TM domain similar to human MAVS. A fluorescence assay showed that TnMAVS was located in the cytoplasm and near by the membrane, and not the mitochondria in FHM cells. As such, it was considered as a new member of MAVS. The TnMAVS was highly expressed in the liver and muscle of T. nigroviridis. In the spleen, TnMAVS was down-regulated when the fish was treated with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid or challenged with ISKNV, but was not affected by PGN or LPS. The dual luciferase reporter assay revealed that TnMAVS overexpression resulted in the activation of the interferon-sensitive response element and NF-κB signal pathways. In addition, a characteristic TRAF3-associated peptide PVQD was found in the TnMAVS sequence. Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that TnMAVS could interact with zfTRAF3 in eukaryotic cells."
0,"Pesticides are one of the most frequently anthropogenic xenobiotics detected in water. Among these, the organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are very widely used in agriculture due to their broad spectrum of activity and their low price, but they also have high potent effects as neurotoxic compounds in non-target organisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate biomarkers acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), propionylcholinesterase (PChE) and carboxylesterase (CbE) in the representative Atlantic fish species Trachurus trachurus, Merluccius merluccius and Trisopterus luscus from ""Rías Gallegas"", a traditional Spanish fishing area. These esterase activities were evaluated in the brain, muscle and liver to determine the most adequate tissue to measure such enzymatic activities. The sensitivity of AChE and CbE activities from different tissues the widely used organophosphorus insecticide chlorpyrifos (CP), and its toxic metabolite (CP-oxon) was also tested. AChE activity was predominant in all tissues of the analysed species (particularly in brain constituting from 78.33%, 89.83% and 88.43% of total ChEs in Trachurus trachurus, Merluccius merluccius and Trisopterus luscus, respectively). Under in vitro exposure, esterases were shown to be highly sensitive to CP and especially to CP-oxon. Moreover, a similar effect observed on AChE and CbE activities could suggest that CbE activity might contribute efficiently against the toxic effects of CP, especially in muscle and the liver. The presence of BChE, PChE and upper CbE activities in muscle and the liver and their OP-sensibilities can be used to study their function in the pesticide biochemical detoxification pathways with a prominent role as a safeguarding mechanism against pesticide toxicity."
0,"Immunoglobulins (Igs), which bind antigens with high specificity, are essential molecules in adaptive immune system of jawed vertebrates. In this study, cDNA encoding the secreted form of the immunoglobulin heavy chain of IgM (sIgM) was cloned from the mesonephros of blunt snout bream (Megalabrama amblycephala) using RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA of sIgM heavy chain gene has 1961 nucleotides encoding a putative protein of 569 amino acids, constant region shares high amino acid identity with that of Ctenopharyngodon idella (80%), Carassius auratus langsdorfii (65%) and Danio rerio (59%). Multiple protein sequence alignment revealed that blunt snout bream sIgM was clustered with the homologues of cyprinid fish and constructed one clade. Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, the level of sIgM mRNA was determined, with a V-shape change pattern: decreased initially from unfertilized egg stage to 4 cells stage and increased from 16 cells stage to prelarva. This sharp drop indicates that sIgM mRNA is maternally transferred, and was continuously degraded until 16 cells stage. The drastic rising in sIgM level from blastula stage to prelarva might be attributed to embryonic stem cell differentiation procedure. Compared with juvenile fish, the expression of sIgM was significantly higher in pronephros, liver, spleen, gill and muscle of adult fish. After the injection of Aeromonas hydrophila, the expression pattern of sIgM was found first down-regulated at 4 h, then up-regulated and reached the peak at 7 d and 21 d in mesonephros, spleen, liver and gill, respectively."
0,"Protein-water partition coefficients (K(pw)) of neutral organic chemicals were measured using muscle proteins (from chicken, fish, and pig), collagen and gelatin. K(pw) values for these structural proteins were consistently lower than those of bovine serum albumin (BSA), indicating that the use of BSA as a model protein leads to an overestimation of K(pw) for structural proteins. Differences in K(pw) between chicken, fish, and pig muscle proteins were small. Across the structural proteins, K(pw) values were often in the order: muscle proteins > collagen ≥ gelatin. Differences in K(pw) between the structural proteins were relatively large (<2 log units) for nonpolar compounds, and much smaller or insignificant for polar compounds. There were correlations between log K(pw) of muscle proteins and log K(ow) (R(2) = 0.83-0.86, SD: 0.35-0.40, n = 45-46). The polyparameter linear free energy relationship (PP-LFER) models fit even better to the data (R(2) = 0.95, SD: 0.22). The good model fitting suggests that the reversible binding to muscle proteins can be considered to be nonspecific binding. There was an indication that some chemicals may sorb irreversibly to muscle proteins, which needs further research. We found that the partitioning to muscle protein is typically weaker than that to lipids, but that the protein partitioning of an H-bond donor compound can be as strong as the storage lipid partitioning."
0,"In addition to the typical sexual size dimorphism, considerable size differences within the female population of the Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) have become a further bottleneck of the improvement of sole aquaculture. To identify the internal mechanism, transcriptomic analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were employed simultaneously. Transcriptomic analyses of brain, pituitary gland, liver, gonad, and muscle tissues from two female groups with size differences identified 109, 698, 1325, 2299, and 2141 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. The results of these enrichment analyses suggest that the up-regulation of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cell cycle, DNA replication, and MAPK signaling pathway in the group with larger females may be involved in the regulation of the observed growth differences. WGCNA of DEGs showed that cell cycle and DNA replication might be crucial pathways for accelerating cell growth in the groups with larger females. Finally, a series of hub genes including 6-phosphofructokinase type C (pfkp), ribosome biogenesis protein (wdr12), bleomycin hydrolase (blmh), and semaphorin-3A (sema3a) were recognized by the illustrated network map of modules. The linkage of cell cycle, DNA replication, and hub genes in the growth regulation of C. semilaevis provides further information for a better understanding of growth differences in fish."
0,"In this study, we investigated the nutritive composition in the muscle of Sinocyclocheilus grahami and S. tingi. The contents of crude protein in the fresh muscle of S. grahami and S. tingi can be described as being 21.7% and 20.6%, crude fat were 3.43% and 2.66%, and total amino acid were 19.23% and 17.67%, respectively. Essential amino acids accounted for 44.08% and 43.69% of total amino acids of S. grahami and S. tingi, respectively. The values of essential amino acid index (EAAI) of the two species were 70.00% and 65.99%, respectively, with S. grahami being better than S. tingi. Ultimately, the amino acid composition of S. grahami and S. tingi muscle tissue met the standards of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as well as those of the World Health Organization (FAO/WHO). According to the nutritive evaluation in amino acid score (AAS), the first limited amino acids of both fish were cystine+methionine. Compared with other commercial fish, the nutrition value of the muscle of Sinocyclocheilus fish can generally be considered as being better. "
0,"Aquaculture requires feed that ensures rapid growth and healthy fish. Higher inclusion of plant ingredients is desirable, as marine resources are limited. In this study we investigated the effects of higher starch inclusion in feed on muscular extracellular matrix and interleukin expression in farmed cod. Starch was replaced by complex fibers in the low-starch diet to keep total carbohydrate inclusion similar. Blood glucose and fructosamine levels were elevated in the high-starch group. The group fed a high-starch diet showed up-regulation on mRNA level of proteoglycans biglycan and decorin. ELISA confirmed the real-time PCR results on protein level for biglycan and also showed increase of lumican. For decorin the protein levels were decreased in the high-starch group, in contrast to real-time PCR results. Disaccharide analyses using HPLC showed reduction of glycosaminoglycans. Further, there was up-regulation of interleukin-1β and -10 on mRNA level in muscle. This study shows that the muscular extracellular matrix composition is affected by diet, and that a high-starch diet results in increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes similar to diabetes in humans."
0,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are proteins that contain highly conserved functional domains and sequence motifs that are correlated with their unique biophysical activities, to regulate cardiac pacemaker activity and synaptic transmission. These pacemaker proteins have been studied in mammalian species, but little is known now about their heart distribution in lower vertebrates and c-AMP modulation. Here, we characterized the pacemaker system in the heart of the wild Atlantic cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>), with respect to primary pacemaker molecular markers. Special focus is given to the structural, ultrastructural and molecular characterization of the pacemaker domain, through the expression of HCN channel genes and the immunohistochemistry of HCN isoforms, including the location of intracardiac neurons that are adjacent to the sinoatrial region of the heart. Similarly to zebrafish and mammals, these neurons are immunoreactive to ChAT, VAChT and nNOS. It has been shown that cardiac pacemaking can be modulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, and the existence of intracardiac neurons projecting back to the central nervous system provide a plausible link between them."
0,"Complement factor B (Bf) is a component of the complement system. Following activation of the alternative pathway of the complement system, factor B is cleaved into Ba and Bb fragments. In fish, the Bf of rainbow trout is known to act as a C3 convertase, but the function of the Ba fragment is essentially unknown. In this study, we examined the expression patterns of tongue sole Cynoglossus semilaevis Bf (named CsBf) and the biological activity of the Ba fragment of CsBf (named CsBa). CsBf possesses the conserved domains of Bf and shares 39.9%-56.4% sequence identities with other fish Bf. CsBf expression was high in liver, muscle, and heart, and low in intestine, blood, and kidney. Bacterial infection significantly induced CsBf expression in kidney, spleen, and liver in a time-dependent manner. Recombinant CsBa (rCsBa) exhibited apparent binding capacities to bacteria and tongue sole peripheral blood leukocytes, and binding of rCsBa to bacteria inhibited bacterial growth. When overexpressed in tongue sole, CsBa significantly reduced bacterial dissemination in fish tissues. Together these results indicate for the first time that a fish Ba possesses antibacterial effect as well as immune cell-binding capacity, and thus probably plays a role in host immune defense against bacterial infection."
0,"The effects of low marine ingredient diets supplemented with graded levels (L1, L2, L3) of a micronutrient package (NP) on growth and metabolic responses were studied in diploid and triploid salmon parr. Diploids fed L2 showed significantly improved growth and reduced liver, hepatic steatosis, and viscerosomatic indices, while fish fed L3 showed suppressed growth rate 14 weeks post feeding. In contrast, dietary NP level had no effect on triploid performance. Whole body mineral composition, with exception of copper, did not differ between diet or ploidy. Whole fish total AAs and N-metabolites showed no variation by diet or ploidy. Free circulating AAs and white muscle N-metabolites were higher in triploids than diploids, while branch-chained amino acids were higher in diploids than triploids. Diploids had higher whole body α-tocopherol and hepatic vitamins K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub> than triploids. Increased tissue B-vitamins for niacin and whole-body folate with dietary NP supplementation were observed in diploids but not triploids, while whole body riboflavin was higher in diploids than triploids. Hepatic transcriptome profiles showed that diploids fed diet L2 was more similar to that observed in triploids fed diet L3. In particular, sterol biosynthesis pathways were down-regulated, whereas cytochrome P450 metabolism was up-regulated. One‑carbon metabolism was also affected by increasing levels of supplementation in both ploidies. Collectively, results suggested that, for optimised growth and liver function, micronutrient levels be supplemented above current National Research Council (2011) recommendations for Atlantic salmon when fed low marine ingredient diets. The study also suggested differences in nutritional requirements between ploidy."
0,"Kisspeptin is an important regulator of reproduction in mammals and presumably non-mammalian species. In the Indian subcontinent, rohu (Labeo rohita) is a commercially important seasonal breeder freshwater fish species, but till date, the expression of kisspeptin gene during different phases of annual reproductive cycle has not been investigated. To address this, we cloned and characterized kiss1 and kiss2 full-length cDNA by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), and analyzed their expressions in brain-pituitary-gonad (BPG) axis by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay at various gonadal developmental stages of the annual reproductive cycle. Full-length rohu kiss1 and kiss2 cDNA encodes 116 and 125 amino acids respectively, and in the adult fish, they were widely expressed in brain, pituitary, gonad, liver, muscle, kidney, intestine and eye. In male, kiss1 mRNA in brain and testis showed the highest level of expression during meiosis division of the gonad. The kiss2 mRNA revealed the highest expression during recrudescence stages in the brain, spermiation stages in pituitary and post-spawning stages in testes. In females, significantly (p<0.05) a higher level of kiss1 transcript was expressed in brain and ovary, in the full grown oocyte stages, whereas during pre-vitellogenic and vitellogenic stages in pituitary. The kiss2 gene expression was almost similar at various gonadal developmental stages in the brain and ovary, but, highest expression was detected in full grown oocyte stages in the pituitary. These results together may suggest the involvement of two kiss genes in the control of seasonal gonadal development in rohu. "
0,"The vocalizing midshipman fish, Porichthys notatus, has two male morphs that exhibit alternative mating tactics. Only territorial males acoustically court females with long duration (minutes to >1h) calls, whereas sneaker males attempt to steal fertilizations. During the breeding season, morph-specific tactics are paralleled by a divergence in relative testis and vocal muscle size, plasma levels of the androgen 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) and the glucocorticoid cortisol, and mRNA expression levels in the central nervous system (CNS) of the steroid-synthesizing enzyme aromatase (estrogen synthase). Here, we tested the hypothesis that the midshipman's two male morphs would further differ in the CNS, as well as in the testis and vocal muscle, in mRNA abundance for the enzymes 11beta-hydroxylase (11betaH) and 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11betaHSD) that directly regulate both 11KT and cortisol synthesis. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated male morph-specific profiles for both enzymes. Territorial males had higher 11betaH and 11betaHSD mRNA levels in testis and vocal muscle. By contrast, sneaker males had the higher CNS expression, especially for 11betaHSD, in the region containing an expansive vocal pacemaker circuit that directly determines the temporal attributes of natural calls. We propose for territorial males that higher enzyme expression in testis underlies its greater plasma 11KT levels, which in vocal muscle provides both gluconeogenic and androgenic support for its long duration calling. We further propose for sneaker males that higher enzyme expression in the vocal CNS contributes to known cortisol-specific effects on its vocal physiology."
0,"It is well known that lysozymes are key proteins to teleosts in the innate immune system and possess high bactericidal properties. In the present study, a g-type lysozyme gene was cloned from Microptenus salmoides. The g-type sequence consisted of 582 bp, which translated into a 193 amino acid (AA) protein (GenBank accession no: MH087462). The predicted molecular weight and theoretical isoelectric point were 21.36 kDa and 6.91 respectively and no signal peptide was observed. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the g-type lysozyme gene was differentially expressed in various tissues under normal conditions and the highest g-type lysozyme level was observed in liver, gill and spleen while there seemed to be low expression in the muscle, heart and head-kidney. The expression of g-type lysozyme was differentially upregulated in the spleen, gill and intestine after stimulation with heat stress and Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila). Under heat stress and A. hydrophila injection, the g-type lysozyme mRNA levels all in spleens, gill and intestine tissues increased significantly (P < 0.05), with the maximum levels attained at 12 h, 24 h (or 12 h) and 24 h. Thereafter, they all decreased significantly (P < 0.01) and the expression in gill returned to nearly the basal value within 72 h. Those results suggested that g-type lysozyme was involved in the immune response to heat stress and bacterial challenge. The cloning and expression analysis of the g-type lysozyme provide theoretical basis to further study the mechanism of anti-adverseness in Microptenus salmoides. The g-type lysozyme gene perhaps also played an important role in the immune responses against bacterial invasion."
0,"The synergistic effect of pH and heating on the structure, aggregation behaviour and gel properties of myofibrillar protein (MP) in mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio) was evaluated. The surface hydrophobicity of the control at pH 5.0 (143.6 ± 0.3 μg) was significantly higher than that of other samples (P < 0.05). Under the same pH conditions, the decrease in total sulfhydryl content of all samples during the heating process demonstrated that covalent/non-covalent cross-linking occurred between proteins due to heat input. Moreover, the decrease in solubility and the increase in turbidity of all samples verified the fact of MP aggregation, and the changes in the elasticity index (EI) and macroscopic viscosity index (MVI) also indicated a decrease in MP fluidity upon heating treatment. Therefore, the aggregation of MP was affected by pH and heating, and the optimal three-dimensional network structure and gel properties could be formed at pH 6.0 and above 70 °C."
0,"In this study, the effect of acute and chronic insulin treatments on major factors involved in the control of muscle protein turnover were investigated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We found that acute but not chronic insulin administration leads to the induction of the phosphorylation of several key factors (IRS1, TOR and 4E-BP1) involved in the control of the protein synthesis and to the concomitant down-regulation of the expression of ubiquitin-proteasome-related genes (atrogin1, C2, C9) and the calpains inhibitor calpastatin. In contrast, no modification of autophagy-related gene (LC3B, gabarpl1, atg4b) expressions was observed suggesting that the mechanisms controlling this proteolytic route have diverged throughout the evolution. Overall, these results provide a possible explanation of the growth-promoting properties of insulin previously described in fish and indicate that this hormone acutely administrated is able to exert a regulatory influence on various factors associated with growth in skeletal muscle."
0,"Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor2 (Havcr2) also named T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing-3 (Tim-3) was initially described as a T helper 1-specific cell surface protein, a member of Tim family implicated in the regulating process of adaptive and innate immune responses. Here, medaka (Oryzias latipes) Havcr2 (OlHavcr2) was isolated and characterized. Unlike other Havcr2 proteins, OlHavcr2 possesses two Ig-like domains but lacks cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. RT-PCR results revealed that OlHavcr2 mRNA was expressed strongly in the liver, moderately in the intestine, heart and ovary, and weakly in the muscle, gill, brain, eye, spleen, and testis. OlHavcr2 expression begun from gastrula stage and was maintained until hatching. The signal of OlHavcr2 was mainly identified in the blood system in the yolk sac by in situ hybridization. These results indicated that OlHavcr2 is expressed ubiquitously in adult tissues, and is a zygotic gene expressed from gastrula onwards in embryogenesis. OlHavcr2 may play a significant role in the blood system of medaka. In the immune organs, OlHavcr2 expression was affected by the immune stimulants, lipopolysaccharide and poly I:C, suggesting that OlHavcr2 was involved in innate immunity and adaptive immunity in medaka."
0,"This study utilized dietary salt loading and ion-poor water (IPW) exposure of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to further understand the role of fish gill epithelium tight junction (TJ) physiology in salt and water balance. Gill morphology, biochemistry and molecular physiology were examined, with an emphasis on genes encoding TJ proteins. Fish were either fed a control or salt-enriched diet (~10 % NaCl) for 4 weeks prior to IPW exposure for 24 h. Serum [Na(+)], [Cl(-)] and muscle moisture content were unaltered by salt feeding, but changed in response to IPW irrespective of diet. Dietary salt loading altered the morphology (reduced Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase-immunoreactive cell numbers and surface exposure of mitochondrion-rich cells), biochemistry (decreased vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase activity) and molecular physiology (decreased nkaα1a and cftrII mRNA abundance) of the gill in a manner indicative of reduced active ion uptake activity. But in control fish and not salt-fed fish, gill mRNA abundance of nkaα1c increased and nbc decreased after IPW exposure. Genes encoding TJ proteins were typically either responsive to salt feeding or IPW, but select genes responded to combined experimental treatment (e.g. IPW responsive but only if fish were salt-fed). Therefore, using salt feeding and IPW exposure, new insights into what factors influence gill TJ proteins and the role that specific TJ proteins might play in regulating the barrier properties of the gill epithelium have been acquired. In particular, evidence suggests that TJ proteins in the gill epithelium, or the regulatory networks that control them, respond independently to external or internal stimuli."
0,"MyoD is one of the helix-loop-helix proteins regulating muscle-specific gene expression in tilapia. Tight regulation of the MyoD protein level is necessary for the precise regulation of skeletal muscle development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of regulatory RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. An increasing amount of evidence has suggested that miRNAs play an important role in regulating skeletal muscle development. We reasoned that MyoD expression may be regulated by miRNAs. Predictions from bioinformatics have identified a putative miR-203b target site in the 3'-UTR of the MyoD gene. Interestingly, miR-203b expression is negatively correlated with MyoD expression, whereas miR-203b suppression leads to a significant increase in MyoD expression, thereby activating MyoD downstream genes. A 3'-UTR luciferase reporter assay further verifies the direct interaction between miR-203b and MyoD. Taken together, our results reveal a novel molecular mechanism in which miRNA participates in transcriptional circuits that regulate gene expression in tilapia skeletal muscle."
0,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different stunning methods (percussion, T1; immersion in ice/water slurry, T2; gill cut, T3) on antioxidant status, in vivo myofibrillar protein (MP) oxidation, and the susceptibility to postmortem oxidation (induced by hydroxyl radical oxidizing system) of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) fillets. Stress conditions, antioxidant enzyme activities, and protein oxidation parameters were analyzed during 72 h postmortem. The results indicated that the strongest stress conditions in the T3 group led to impaired glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity, and significantly (P < .05) higher carbonyl concentrations, thereby promoted in vivo MP oxidation of fillets. The T3 group also showed severe losses in myosin heavy chain (MHC) intensities and sulfhydryl groups at higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Overall, fillets from the T3 group were more susceptible to oxidative damage, and the T1 and T2 groups maintained better quality in terms of lower MP oxidation rates."
0,"Production of bioactive peptides via enzymatic hydrolysis is a sustainable way to take advantage of proteinaceous by-products from food industry, such as fish discards. Sardine pilchardus protein was subjected to different enzymatic treatments using two endopeptidases of different selectivity and one exopeptidase in order to produce hydrolysates with antidiabetic activity. The highest dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitory activity was obtained by the combination of three enzymes (subtilisin, trypsin and flavourzyme) employed sequentially. This hydrolysate was subsequently purified by size exclusion chromatography to obtain fractions sorted by size (hydrodynamic volume). Peptides below 1400 Dalton had the highest activity, and these pools were analysed by mass spectrometry in order to identify the peptides responsible for that activity. Numerous peptides with adequate molecular features, it is, owning an alanine (A) as their penultimate N-terminal residue (e.g. NAPNPR, YACSVR) were identified and are proposed to be antidiabetic peptides from Sardine pilchardus muscle."
0,"Ultrasound-assisted freezing (UF) has proven to be a method that can effectively increase the freezing rate of frozen food and improve its quality. The functional properties of myofibrillar proteins (MP) are important factors that affect the further processing quality of meat products. At present, the effect of UF on the functional properties of frozen MP is not yet clear. Therefore, in the present study, changes in the functional properties (emulsifying and gel properties) of MP in common carps (Cyprinus carpio) frozen with UF at different power levels were investigated. The results revealed that, compared with immersion freezing (IF), UF at 175 W (UF-175) effectively inhibited the decrease in protein solubility, absolute Zeta potential, emulsion activity index, storage modulus (G'), and loss modulus (G'') caused by freezing. UF-175 sample had lower protein turbidity, and smaller protein particle size than any other frozen samples (P < 0.05), which suggested that UF-175 inhibited protein aggregation induced by freezing. In addition, shorter T<sub>21</sub> and T<sub>22</sub> relaxation times were obtained in UF-175 sample than other frozen samples, indicating that UF-175 reduced the mobility of immobilized and free water. Accordingly, UF-175 sample had higher gel strength and water holding capacity than other frozen samples (P < 0.05). A denser and more uniform gel network structure was also found in UF-175 sample than other frozen samples. In general, improved functional properties of common carp MP can be achieved by optimal UF."
0,"Heat shock protein 22 (Hsp22) is an important regulatory factor response to various stresses in mammals. In this study, the full length cDNA of Epinephelus coioides Hsp22, which was 1680bp in length, with a 289 bp 5' UTR, a 725 bp 3'UTR, and a 666 bp open reading frame encoding 221 amino acids, was obtained. E. coioides Hsp22 contains a highly conserved α-crystallin domain. E. coioides Hsp22 mRNA was detected in all tissues examined by quantitative real-time PCR, with the highest expression in blood, followed by the spleen, skin, gill, head kidney, muscle, heart, liver, trunk kidney, stomach, pyloric caeca, intestine, brain and thymus. The expression patterns of E. coioides Hsp22 response to infection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and Vribro alginolyticus, the important pathogens of E. coioides, were studied. The expression levels of the gene were up-regulated in the tissues examined. Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that E. coioides Hsp22 was distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. In addition, E. coioides Hsp22 significantly inhibited the SGIV-induced cell apoptosis. In summary, the E. coioides Hsp22 might play a critical role in pathogenic stimulation."
0,"The increasing global trade of fishery and aquaculture products makes it necessary to develop methods for species identification in case of fish fillets or other highly processed seafood with external morphological characteristics (e.g. gills, fins) of the original fish being removed. Species identification methods based on DNA- or protein-analysis, like DNA sequencing of PCR products, PCR-SSCP (polymerase chain reaction - single strand conformation polymorphism), and isoelectric focusing (IEF) of water-soluble proteins of fish fillet were applied successfully to distinguish between various sparid species including Sparus aurata, Spondyliosoma cantharus, Boops boops, Acanthopagrus bifasciatus, Argyrops spinifer, Pagellus bogaraveo and Lithognathus mormyrus of the family Sparidae available on European markets. Indication of the presence of parvalbumins in light muscle of all of the studied species is presented by the location of heat-stable proteins in the anodic range of the IEF gels."
0,"We investigated the effect of fish oil supplementation for two consecutive generations on insulin sensitivity in rats. After the nursing period (21 days), female rats from the same prole were divided into two groups: (a) control group and (b) fish oil group. Female rats were supplemented with water (control) or fish oil at 1 g/kg body weight as a single bolus for 3 months. After this period, female rats were mated with male Wistar rats fed on a balanced chow diet (not supplemented). Female rats continued to receive supplementation throughout gestation and lactation periods. The same treatment was performed for the next two generations (G1 and G2). At 75 days of age, male offspring from G1 and G2 generations from both groups were used in the experiments. G1 rats did not present any difference with control rats. However, G2 rats presented reduction in glycemia and lipidemia and improvement in in vivo insulin sensitivity (model assessment of insulin resistance, insulin tolerance test) as well as in vitro insulin sensitivity in soleus muscle (glucose uptake and metabolism). This effect was associated with increased insulin-stimulated p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation and lower n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio, but not with activation of proteins from insulin signaling (IR, IRS-1 and Akt). Global DNA methylation was decreased in liver but not in soleus muscle. These results suggest that long-term fish oil supplementation improves insulin sensitivity in association with increased insulin-stimulated p38 activation and decreased n-6:n-3 ratio in skeletal muscle and decreased global DNA methylation in liver."
0,"NADPH plays a central role in reductive biosynthesis of membrane lipids, maintenance of cell integrity, protein synthesis and redox balance maintenance. Hence, NADPH is involved in the growth and proliferation processes. In addition, it has been shown that changes in nutritional conditions produced changes in NADPH levels and growth rate. Maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic triterpene of natural origin, is able to stimulate NADPH production, through regulation of the two oxidative phase dehydrogenases of the pentose phosphate pathway. Our main objective was to study the effects of MA on the kinetic behaviour and on the molecular expression of two NADPH-generating systems, NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-IDH) and malic enzyme (ME), in the liver and white muscle of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). Four groups of 12g of a mean body mass were fed for 210days in a fish farm, with diets containing 0 (control), and 0.1g of MA per kg of diet. Two groups were fed ad libitum (C-AL and MA-AL) and another's two, with restricted diet of 1% of fish weight (C-R and MA-R). Results showed that MA significantly increased the main kinetic parameter of the NADPH-forming enzymes (NADP-IDH and ME). In this sense, specific activity, maximum velocity, catalytic efficiency and activity ratio values were higher in MA conditions than control groups. Moreover, these changes were observed in both feeding regimen, AL and R. Meanwhile, the Michaelis constant changed mainly in groups fed with the MA and restricted diet, these changes are related to the best substrate affinity by enzyme. Moreover, in the Western-blot result, we found that MA increased both protein levels studied, this behaviour being consistent with the regulation of the number of enzyme molecules. All results, indicate that MA, independently of the fed regimen, could potentially be a nutritional additive for fish as it improved the metabolic state of fish, as consequence of increased activity and expression of NADP-IDH and ME enzymes.

0,"The growth and differentiation factor Myostatin (MSTN, also known as GDF8) negatively regulates skeletal muscle development and growth in vertebrates. Most fish genomes contain two or more <i>mstn</i> genes, which are expressed in muscle and other tissues. Yet, in the genome of Nile tilapia (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>), which is one of the world's most important aquaculture fish species, only one <i>mstn</i> gene has previously been identified. Here, we identify a second <i>mstn</i> gene in Nile tilapia. We show that it clusters phylogenetically with other piscine <i>mstn2</i> genes and that it shares chromosomal synteny with the human and zebrafish orthologs. We further show that <i>mstn2</i> is not expressed in red or white muscles of Nile tilapia, but rather that its main site of expression is the brain. To determine which physiological functions are correlated with <i>mstn</i> expression, adult Nile tilapia were exposed to various environmental conditions and their effect on <i>mstn1</i> and <i>mstn2</i> expression in the brain and muscles was measured using real-time PCR. We found that the centrally- and muscle-expressed <i>mstn</i> genes differ in their responsiveness to diverse challenges, suggesting differential gene- and tissue-specific regulation of their expression. Metabolic and stress marker analyses showed that the altered <i>mstn</i> expression is not regulated by classical stress response. Taken together, our findings expand the understanding of the MSTN system in Nile tilapia and provide evolutionary insight into its function."
0,"We investigated the metabolic and cellular stress responses in an endemic catfish Horabagrus brachysoma acclimated to ambient (26°C), 31, 33 and 36°C for 30 days. After acclimation, fish were sampled to investigate changes in the levels of blood glucose, tissue glycogen and ascorbic acid, activities of enzymes involved in glycolysis (LDH), citric acid cycle (MDH), gluconeogenesis (FBPase and G6Pase), pentose phosphate pathway (G6PDH), protein metabolism (AST and ALT), phosphate metabolism (ACP and ALP) and energy metabolism (ATPase), and HSP70 levels in various tissues. Acclimation to higher temperatures (33 and 36°C) significantly increased activities of LDH, MDH, ALP, ACP, AST, ALT and ATPase and blood glucose levels, whereas decreased the G6PDH enzyme activity and, tissue glycogen and ascorbic acid. Results indicated an overall increase in the carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism implying increased metabolic demands for maintaining homeostasis in fish acclimated to higher temperatures (33 and 36°C). We observed tissue specific response of HSP70 in H. brachysoma, with significant increase in gill and liver at 33 and 36°C, and in brain and muscle at 36°C, enabling cellular protection at higher acclimation temperatures. In conclusion, H. brachysoma adjusted metabolic and cellular responses to withstand increased temperatures, however, these responses suggest that the fish was under stress at 33°C or higher temperature."
0,"Hyperplasia and hypertrophy are two distinct processes of skeletal muscle growth regulated by four myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs, contains MyoD, Myf5, Mrf4 and myogenin (MyoG)) and myostatin (MSTN). In this study, characterization of muscle morphology and satellite cells in juvenile (1-year-old) and adult (2-year-old) Megalobrama amblycephala was described. Compared with 1-year-old M. amblycephala, the diameter scope of epaxial, horizontal septum and hypaxial muscle fibers including red and white muscle in 2-year-old fish exhibited broader with dramatic reduction in frequency distribution of <20 μm diameter, nevertheless observable increase in frequency distribution of >50 μm diameter. Intermyofibrillar (IM) nuclei were also found except numerous subsarcolemmal (SS) nuclei in 2-year-old fish, whereas only SS nuclei were observed in 1-year-old fish. Immunofluorescence results showed that more satellite cells existed in red muscle than white muscle in 1-year-old fish, rather than 2-year-old fish. Moreover, we observed predominant increase in the mRNA levels of MyoD, Myf5, Mrf4, and MSTN during muscle development of fish in 2-year-old fish except MyoG."
0,"Metallothionein (MT) has a characteristic molecular structure with a cysteine-rich content. This unique structure provides metal-binding and redox capabilities and promoting metal homeostasis and detoxification in living animals. In order to evaluate the effects of cadmium (Cd) on hepatic MT expression in the liver of Acrossocheilus fasciatus, we obtained the complete cDNA of the A. fasciatus liver MT for the first time. The MT cDNA contains a 605-bp sequence, which codes for 60 amino acids. Protein alignment showed that the similarity between MT protein sequences of A. fasciatus and those of other vertebrates (especially teleosts) was very high and a cysteine residue structure was also conserved. MT was detected in the liver, kidney, gill, testis, muscle, spleen, heart and brain tissues of A. fasciatus by tissue-specific expression analysis. After Cd exposure, Cd/hemoglobin saturation assay, immunohistochemistry and reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were used to describe MT expression in liver tissue. These techniques indicate a sensitive response by liver MT to Cd exposure. The results suggest that A. fasciatus MT may play an important role in the detoxification processes in the liver, and also would be a useful biomarker for monitoring metal pollution in aquatic environments. In addition, A. fasciatus could be regarded as one candidate for a model species for bony fishes in ecotoxicology."
0,"B cell-activating factor (BAFF)is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family and plays roles in B cell survival and maturation. In this study, the full-length cDNA of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) BAFF (tBAFF) was amplified from the spleen by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The open reading frame of this cDNA encodes a protein of 261 amino acids containing a predicted transmembrane domain and a furin protease cleavage site, similar to mammalian, avian, and reptile BAFF. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that tBAFF is present in various tissues and is predominantly expressed in the spleen. The predicted three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) soluble BAFF (tsBAFF) monomer was determined by (3D) structure modeling monomeranalyzed by (3D) structure mouse counterpart. Both tsBAFF and EGFP/tsBAFF were efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), as confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. After purification, the EGFP/tsBAFF fusion protein showed a fluorescence spectrum similar to that of EGFP. Laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that EGFP/tsBAFF bound to its receptor. In vitro, tsBAFF promoted the proliferation of Nile tilapia and mouse splenic B cells together with/without a priming agent (Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, SAC) or anti-mouse IgM. Furthermore, tsBAFF showed a similar proliferation-stimulating effect on mouse B cells compared to msBAFF. These findings indicate that tsBAFF plays an important role in the proliferation of Nile tilapia B cells and has functional cross-reactivity among Nile tilapia and mammals. Therefore, BAFF may represent a useful factor for enhancing immunological efficacy in animals. "
0,"Fundc1 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein and plays important roles in mitochondria fission and hypoxia-induced mitophagy in mammalian cells. However, there is no relevant report of fundc1 in fish. In the present study, we cloned a 942bp fundc1 cDNA from rare minnow. The cDNA, designated as Grfundc1 cDNA, contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 459bp which encodes a polypeptide of 152 amino acid residues. Comparisons of deduced amino acid sequences demonstrated that Grfundc1 was highly homologous with those of other vertebrates. RT-PCR and real time PCR detection revealed that the transcripts of Grfundc1 were not detectable in the unfertilized eggs and had high levels at blastula and gastrula stages. Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis observed that Grfundc1 was ubiquitously expressed at early stage and later riched in specific regions, such as brain, branchial arch, eye and somite during embryogenesis. Grfundc1 was expressed in all the tissues of rare minnow adult, including brain, liver, gill, eyes, heart, kidney, intestine, muscle, testis and ovary. The expression of Grfundc1 in the brain, gill, heart and eye of rare minnow adult was significantly down-regulated by hypoxia. Similar hypoxic response was observed in the rare minnow embryos at 48hpf following hypoxia exposure. Functional analysis showed that knockdown of Grfundc1 significantly caused defects in the body axis and dorsal neural tissues of rare minnow embryos. These results indicate that Grfundc1 may play important roles in embryogenesis in fish."
0,"Whether hypoxic acclimation influences nitric oxide (NO)-mediated control of fish cardiac function is not known. Thus, we measured the function/performance of myocardial strips from normoxic- and hypoxic-acclimated (40% air saturation; ∼8 kPa O<sub>2</sub>) trout at several frequencies (20-80 contractions·min<sup>-1</sup>) and two muscle strain amplitudes (8% and 14%) when exposed to increasing concentrations of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup> M). Further, we examined the influence of <i>1</i>) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) produced NO [by blocking NOS with 10<sup>-4</sup> M <i>N</i><sup>G</sup>-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA)] and <i>2</i>) soluble guanylyl cyclase mediated, NOS-independent, NO effects (i.e., after blockade with 10<sup>-4</sup> M ODQ), on myocardial contractility. Hypoxic acclimation increased twitch duration by 8%-10% and decreased mass-specific net power by ∼35%. However, hypoxic acclimation only had minor impacts on the effects of SNP and the two blockers on myocardial function. The most surprising finding of the current study was the degree to which contraction frequency and strain amplitude influenced NO-mediated effects on myocardial power. For example, at 8% strain, 10<sup>-4</sup> SNP resulted in a decrease in net power of ∼30% at 20 min<sup>-1</sup> but an increase of ∼20% at 80 min<sup>-1</sup>, and this effect was magnified at 14% strain. This research suggests that hypoxic acclimation has only minor effects on NO-mediated myocardial contractility in salmonids, is the first to report the high frequency- and strain-dependent nature of NO effects on myocardial contractility in fishes, and supports previous work showing that NO effects on the heart (myocardium) are finely tuned spatiotemporally."
0,"Pufferfish saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin binding protein (PSTBP) was previously isolated from the plasma of the marine pufferfish, Takifugu pardalis. In this study, we investigated distribution pattern of PSTBP in intestine, liver, ovary, skin, and skeletal muscle of T. pardalis by immunohistochemical staining for the study of functions of this protein. In the skin, dermis around the tetrodotoxin secreting gland was positive, while this secreting gland itself was negative. In the ovary containing vitellogenic oocytes, ovarian wall and vitelline envelope were positive, while yolk and nucleus were negative. In the liver, hepatocytes with large fat droplets and capillaries were positive. In the intestine, the lamina propria mucosae were positive, while the mucosal epithelium was negative. In the skeletal muscle, only capillaries were positive. Furthermore, liver specific expression of PSTBP was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Based on these results together with reported tetrodotoxin localization pattern in pufferfish, PSTBP was assumed to be a carrier protein to transfer tetrodotoxin among the tissues, especially liver, ovary, and skin.

0,"Ceruloplasmin is an acute phase protein found to be activated by the host immune system during stress conditions. The ceruloplasmin gene has been reported in several teleosts and here we characterize the gene and test its association with resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila in rohu, Labeo rohita. A ceruloplasmin mRNA sequence of 3355 base pairs (bp) was derived (GenBank ID: JX010736). The coding sequence (CDS) comprised of 3276 bp that coded for 1092 amino acids. Alignment results showed the greatest similarity with zebrafish followed by channel catfish sequence, and a phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of amino acid sequences showed that rohu shares a common clade with these two species. In the ontogeny study, the expression of ceruloplasmin was detected at 9 h post-fertilization onwards, and a strong level of expression was detected at 24 h (38-fold) and 15 days (34-fold) post-fertilization. The ceruloplasmin transcripts were evident in liver, spleen, stomach and heart. Expression was undetectable in gill, brain, eye, skin, muscle, intestine, anterior and posterior kidney tissues. Expression of ceruloplasmin after A. hydrophila infection was up-regulated 6 h post-challenge and was modulated until 15 days post-challenge. The level of ceruloplasmin was also compared in rohu selectively bred for higher growth and disease resistance. The gene showed a 4.58-fold higher level of expression in resistant line over susceptible line rohu selected based on family challenge test survival to A. hydrophila. Serum ceruloplasmin levels in three year classes of rohu selected for higher growth showed a positive correlation (0.49 ± 1.11) with survival against challenge with A. hydrophila. The estimated heritability was also found to be quite high (0.50 ± 0.22) for this parameter. Thus, ceruloplasmin could be one of the useful marker traits for selection against A. hydrophila resistance in fish."
0,"Acid proteins capable of nucleating Ca<sup>2+</sup> and displaying aggregation capacity play key roles in the formation of calcium carbonate biominerals. The helix-loop helix EF-hands are the most common Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding motifs in proteins. Calcium is bound by the loop region. These motifs are found in many proteins that are regulated by calcium. Gad m 1, an Atlantic cod β-parvalbumin isoform, is a monomeric EF-hand protein that acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer in fish muscle; the neutral and acid apo-forms of this protein can form amyloids. Since Ca<sup>2+</sup>-nucleating proteins have a propensity to form extended β-strand structures, we wondered whether amyloid assemblies of an EF-hand protein were able to influence calcium carbonate crystallization in vitro. Here, we used the Gad m 1 chain as a model to generate monomeric and amyloid assemblies and to analyze their effect on calcite formation in vitro. We found that only amyloid assemblies alter calcite morphology."
0,"The effects of ionic strength (0, 0.3, and 0.6 M KCl) and temperature (4 and 25 degrees C) on the interaction between fish myoglobin and myofibrillar proteins were investigated in a model system. Increases in the relative content of bound myoglobin and metmyoglobin formation in myoglobin-natural actomyosin (NAM) mixtures with concurrent decreases in whiteness and Ca(2+)-ATPase activity were observed with increasing ionic strength (P < 0.05). The relative content of bound myoglobin and the oxidation of oxymyoglobin were generally greater at 25 degrees C than at 4 degrees C (P < 0.05). Binding of myoglobin to NAM resulted in decreased whiteness (P < 0.05). Ca(2+)-ATPase was not affected by temperature (P > 0.05). SDS-PAGE patterns of protein samples suggested that myoglobin-NAM interactions did not involve disulfide bonds. The formation of high-molecular-weight aggregates (>206 kDa) was observed and was more pronounced at higher ionic strength and higher temperature."
0,"PPAR gamma was a key nuclear receptor, playing an important role in the immune defense and the anti-inflammatory mechanism. In this study, the full-length PPAR gamma (EcPPAR gamma) was obtained, containing a 5'UTR of 133 bp, an ORF of 1602 bp and a 3'UTR of 26 bp besides the poly (A) tail. The EcPPAR gamma gene encoded a protein of 533 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 60.02 KDa and a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 6.26. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that EcPPAR gamma consisted of the conserved residues and the domains known to be critical for the PPAR gamma function. The quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that EcPPAR gamma transcript was expressed in all the examined tissue, while the strong expression was observed in intestine, followed by the expression in liver, gill, spleen heart, kidney and muscle. Vibrio challenge could stimulate the inflammatory response in grouper and induce a sharp increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, while the up-regulation of vibrio-induced inflammation could also increase the non-specific immune defense. The groupers challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus showed a sharp increase of EcPPAR gamma transcript in immune tissues. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that EcPPAR gamma was distributed in the nucleus. Furthermore, overexpression of EcPPAR gamma could down-regulated the expression of IL1b, IL6, TNF1 and TNF2. In addition, the administration of PPAR gamma antagonist, GW9662, could up-regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including IL1b, IL6, TNF1 and TNF2. Together, these results indicated that EcPPAR gamma serving as a negative regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokines may play an important role in the immune defense against vibrio-induced inflammation in grouper.

0,"Two subtypes of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-1 are present in salmon blood and they are both up-regulated under catabolic conditions such as stress. The present study examined effects of fasting and re-feeding on IGFBP-1a (28-kDa form) and IGFBP-1b (22-kDa form) both at mRNA and protein levels along with IGF-I and RNA/DNA ratio in yearling masu salmon. Fish were individually tagged and assigned to one of three treatments: Fed, Fasted or Re-fed. Circulating IGF-I levels significantly decreased after fasting for 5 weeks and were positively correlated with individual growth rates. Liver igf-1 mRNA levels were not affected by the treatment. Muscle RNA/DNA ratio did not respond to fasting nor showed correlations with growth rates. Circulating IGFBP-1a and IGFBP-1b increased during fasting and decreased after re-feeding. Both serum levels were inversely correlated with growth rates, while IGFBP-1b had consistent negative relationships with growth rates. Fasting/re-feeding also affected their mRNA levels in the liver. These results suggest that circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-1b could serve as positive and negative indices of growth, respectively, in masu salmon. Different sensitivities of IGBP-1a and IGFBP-1b may be useful to assess a broad range of catabolic conditions when they are combined."
0,"Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and autophagy pathways are implicated in disuse muscle atrophy. The effects of high eicosapentaenoic (EPA) or high docosahexaenoic (DHA) fish oils on soleus muscle ERS and autophagy markers were investigated in a rat hindlimb suspension (HS) atrophy model. Adult Wistar male rats received daily by gavage supplementation (0.3 mL per 100 g b.w.) of mineral oil or high EPA or high DHA fish oils (FOs) for two weeks. Afterward, the rats were subjected to HS and the respective treatments concomitantly for an additional two-week period. After four weeks, we evaluated ERS and autophagy markers in the soleus muscle. Results were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni post hoc test. Gastrocnemius muscle ω-6/ω-3 fatty acids (FAs) ratio was decreased by both FOs indicating the tissue incorporation of omega-3 fatty acids. HS altered (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the protein content (decreasing total p38 and BiP and increasing p-JNK2/total JNK2 ratio, and caspase 3) and gene expressions (decreasing BiP and increasing IRE1 and PERK) of ERS and autophagy (decreasing Beclin and increasing LC3 and ATG14) markers in soleus. Both FOs attenuated (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the increase in PERK and ATG14 expressions induced by HS. Thus, both FOs could potentially attenuate ERS and autophagy in skeletal muscles undergoing atrophy."
0,"The effects of fish oil (FO) supplementation on glycaemic control are unclear, and positive effects may occur only when the phospholipid content of tissue membranes exceeds 14% as n-3 PUFA. Subjects (n 36, thirty-three completed) were paired based on metabolic parameters and allocated into a parallel double-blind randomised trial with one of each pair offered daily either 6 g of FO (3·9 g n-3 PUFA) or 6 g of maize oil (MO) for 9 months. Hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic-euaminoacidaemic (HIEGEAA) clamps (with [6,6 2H2 glucose]) were performed at the start and end of the intervention. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and whole-body protein turnover (WBPT) were each measured after an overnight fast. The primary outcome involved the effect of oil type on insulin sensitivity related to glycaemic control. The secondary outcome involved the effect of oil type on WBPT. Subjects on FO (n 16) had increased erythrocyte n-3 PUFA concentrations >14%, whereas subjects on MO (n 17) had unaltered n-3 PUFA concentrations at 9%. Type of oil had no effect on fasting EGP, insulin sensitivity or total glucose disposal during the HIEGEAA clamp. In contrast, under insulin-stimulated conditions, total protein disposal (P=0·007) and endogenous WBPT (P=0·001) were both increased with FO. In an associated pilot study (n 4, three completed), although n-3 PUFA in erythrocyte membranes increased to >14% with the FO supplement, the enrichment in muscle membranes remained lower (8%; P<0·001). In conclusion, long-term supplementation with FO, at amounts near the safety limits set by regulatory authorities in Europe and the USA, did not alter glycaemic control but did have an impact on WBPT."
0,"The interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is strongly induced in many cell types by double-stranded RNA (polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid, poly I:C) and viral infection. In this study, we described the nucleotide, mRNA tissue distribution and regulation of an ISG15 gene from turbot, Scophthalmus maximus (SmISG15). SmISG15 gene is 862 bp in length, composed of two exons and one intron, and encodes 158 amino acids. The deduced protein exhibits the highest homology (44.7-71.2% identity) with ISG15s from other fishes and possesses two conserved tandem ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains and a C-terminal RLRGG conjugating motif known to be important for the functions of ISG15s in vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis grouped SmISG15 into fish ISG15. SmISG15 mRNA was constitutively expressed in all tissues examined, with higher levels observed in immune organs. Gene expression analysis was performed for SmISG15 in the spleen, head kidney, gills and muscle of turbots challenged with poly I:C or turbot reddish body iridovirus (TRBIV) over a 7-day time course. The result showed that SmISG15 was upregulated by both stimuli in all four tissues, with induction by poly I:C apparently stronger and initiated more quickly. A two-wave induced expression of SmISG15 was seen in the spleen, head kidney and gills, suggesting an induction of SmISG15 either by IFN-dependent or -independent pathway. These results provide insights into the roles of fish ISG15 in antiviral immunity."
0,"The levels of trace elements (As, Hg, Cr, Cd, Pb, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn and Zn) in commercially important fish species sampled from fish markets of Adelaide, Australia; canned fish from South Australian supermarkets; and fish markets of West Bengal, India were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after microwave digestion. Mercury was determined by using triple quadrupole ICP-MS. The accuracy of the methods was assessed with a certified standard reference material (NRCC-DORM-3 dogfish protein), and the results were compared with values reported in the literature. The results indicated considerable variations in the accumulation of trace elements among the fish species. The relationship between species with respect to trace element concentrations was examined using cluster analysis, which showed Indian fish species forming distinct groups from the others. Other than As in sardines, whiting and snapper and Hg in swordfish and snapper, the trace element concentrations were within permissible limits recommended by various standards. Based on the estimated daily intake (EDI), fish samples analysed in this study can be considered safe for human consumption as per the recommended daily dietary allowance limit fixed by various agencies. Continuous monitoring and assessments of fish metal(loid) content are needed to generate more data and safeguard human health."
0,"In the present study, purification and properties of an extracellular neutral serine protease from the fungus Penicillium italicum and its potential application as an antioxidant peptides producer are reported. The protease was purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration, diethylaminoethanol (DEAE)-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography, and TSK-HPLC gel filtration with a 10.2-fold increase in specific activity and 25.8 % recovery. The purified enzyme appeared as single protein band with a molecular mass of 24 kDa in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The optimum pH and temperature for the proteolytic activity were pH 7.0 and 50 °C, respectively. The enzyme was stable in the pH range of 6.0-9.0. The protease was activated by divalent cations such as Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). Complete inhibition of the purified enzyme by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride confirmed that the protease was of serine-type. The purified enzyme revealed high stability and relatively broad specificity. Scorpaena notata muscle protein hydrolysates prepared using purified serine protease (protease from P. italicum (Prot-Pen)) showed good in vitro antioxidative activities. The antioxidant activities of Scorpaena muscle protein hydrolyzed by Prot-Pen (SMPH-PP) were evaluated using various antioxidant assays: 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, reducing power, ferrous chelating activity, and DNA nicking assay. SMPH-PP showed varying degrees of antioxidant activity and almost the same strongest protection against hydroxyl radical induced DNA breakage."
0,"Mitochondrial content, central to aerobic metabolism, is thought to be controlled by a few transcriptional master regulators, including nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), NRF-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Though well studied in mammals, the mechanisms by which these factors control mitochondrial content have been less studied in lower vertebrates. We evaluated the role of these transcriptional regulators in seasonal changes in white muscle cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity in eight local fish species representing five families: Centrarchidae, Umbridae, Esocidae, Gasterosteidae and Cyprinidae. Amongst centrarchids, COX activity was significantly higher in winter for pumpkinseed (2-fold) and black crappie (1.3-fold) but not bluegill or largemouth bass. In esociforms, winter COX activity was significantly higher in central mudminnow (3.5-fold) but not northern pike. COX activity was significantly higher in winter-acclimatized brook stickleback (2-fold) and northern redbelly dace (3-fold). Though mudminnow COX activity increased in winter, lab acclimation to winter temperatures did not alter COX activity, suggesting a role for non-thermal cues. When mRNA was measured for putative master regulators of mitochondria, there was little evidence for a uniform relationship between COX activity and any of NRF-1, NRF-2α or PGC-1α mRNA levels Collectively, these studies argue against a simple temperature-dependent mitochondrial response ubiquitous in fish, and suggest that pathways which control mitochondrial content in fish may differ in important ways from those of the better studied mammals."
0,"To consider the idea that a dietary botanical supplement could act as an adaptogen in a teleost fish, the effect of a liquorice root derivative (18β-glycyrrhetinic acid, 18βGA) on rainbow trout following an acute ionoregulatory stressor was examined. Freshwater (FW) trout were fed a control or 18βGA supplemented diet (0, 5, or 50μg 18βGA/g diet) for 2weeks, then abruptly exposed to ion-poor water (IPW) for 24h. Following IPW exposure, muscle moisture content and serum cortisol levels elevated and serum [Na(+)] and/or [Cl(-)] reduced in control and 50μg/g 18βGA-fed fish. However, these endpoints were unaltered in 5μg/g 18βGA-fed fish. Gill tissue was investigated for potential mechanisms of 18βGA action by examining mRNA abundance of genes encoding corticosteroid receptors (CRs), 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11β-hsd2), and tight junction (TJ) proteins, as well as Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and H(+)-ATPase activity, and mitochondrion-rich cell (MRC) morphometrics. Following IPW exposure, CR and 11β-hsd2 mRNA, MRC fractional surface, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and H(+)-ATPase activity were unaltered or decreased in 50μg 18βGA fish, as was mRNA encoding select TJ proteins. In contrast, 5μg 18βGA-fed fish exhibited elevated 11β-hsd2 and CR mRNA abundance versus 50μg 18βGA-fed, and reduced MRC apical area as well as some differences in TJ protein mRNA abundance versus control fish. Data suggest that 18βGA, at low levels, may be adaptogenic in trout and might help to ameliorate ionoregulatory perturbation following IPW exposure. This seems to occur, in part, through 18βGA-induced alterations in the biochemistry and physiology of the gill."
0,"This study demonstrated the feasibility of producing soluble protein (CFSP) and insoluble protein (CFISP) fractions from catfish muscle protein. CFSP and CFISP contained 60.6% and 73.8% protein and 8.6% and 20.3% fat, respectively. Both CFSP and CFISP contained essential amino acids. Differences were observed between physicochemical properties of the 2 protein fractions, including nitrogen solubility, emulsion stability, and fat adsorption capacity. The flow and viscoelastic properties of the emulsions prepared with CFSP and CFISP were investigated using a rheometer. The power law model and the Casson model were used to determine the flow behavior index (n), consistency index (K), and yield stress. Emulsion containing CFSP (ECFSP) had a higher K value than emulsion containing CFISP (ECFISP). Both ECFSP and ECFISP emulsions exhibited pseudoplastic behavior and viscoelastic characteristics. The G' (an elastic or storage modulus) and G″ (a viscous or loss modulus) values for ECFSP were higher than ECFISP. Catfish muscle tissue can be easily separated into soluble and insoluble protein powders that have desirable functional properties."
0,"Glutamine synthetase (GS) is considered a master enzyme that catalyzes ATP-dependent biosynthesis of glutamine from glutamate. In the present study, the GS gene was cloned from the intestine of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). The full-length cDNA sequence of GS encodes a 371-amino-acid polypetide. Phylogenetic analysis of the C. idellus GS sequence reveals common carp (Cyprinus carpio) as its closest neighbor. GS mRNA was differentially expressed in different tissues, with high to low gradient expression the intestine, brain, muscle, heart, gill, liver, pituitary gland, and spleen. Additionally, GS exhibited a dynamic pattern of expression during embryonic development, reaching maximal and minimal levels in the organ and hatching stages, respectively, and constant low levels from 7 to 28days post-hatching. We also assessed dietary protein levels and feed sources in diet-regulated fish, and the results suggested that low crude protein (CP) and fish meal stimulate GS gene expression. Furthermore, intestinal GS mRNA expression was significantly increased by 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8mM concentrations of glutamine dipeptide in vitro. This study provides valuable knowledge about the regulation of GS expression in teleosts."
0,"Siamese fighting fish Betta splendens are notorious for their aggressiveness and accordingly have been widely used to study aggression. However, the lack of a reference genome has, to date, limited the understanding of the genetic basis of aggression in this species. Here, we present the first reference genome assembly of the Siamese fighting fish."
1,"Frist, we sequenced and de novo assembled a 465.24-Mb genome for the B. splendens variety Giant, with a weighted average (N50) scaffold size of 949.03 Kb and an N50 contig size of 19.01 Kb, covering 99.93% of the estimated genome size. To obtain a chromosome-level genome assembly, we constructed one Hi-C library and sequenced 75.24 Gb reads using the BGISEQ-500 platform. We anchored approximately 93% of the scaffold sequences into 21 chromosomes and evaluated the quality of our assembly using the high-contact frequency heat map and Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs. We also performed comparative chromosome analyses between Oryzias latipes and B. splendens, revealing a chromosome conservation evolution in B. splendens. We predicted  23,981 genes assisted by RNA-sequencing data generated from brain, liver, muscle, and heart tissues of Giant and annotated 15% repetitive sequences in the genome. Additionally, we resequenced five other B. splendens varieties and detected ∼3.4 M single-nucleotide variations and  27,305 insertions and deletions."

0,"Myostatin (MSTN) is a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth in mammalian species, and its activity is inhibited by MSTN prodomain, the N-terminal part of proMSTN cleaved during post-translational MSTN processing. In fish, MSTN also appears to suppress fish muscle growth with its activity being inhibited by prodomain. The objective of this study was to produce bioactive MSTN-1 prodomain of rockfish (S. schlegeli), a commercial aquaculture species in East Asia, in E. coli using maltose binding protein (MBP) as a fusion partner. Rockfish MSTN-1 prodomain (sMSTN1pro) cDNA was cloned into the pMALc2x vector, and proteins (MBP-sMSTN1pro) were expressed in Rosetta-gami 2(DE3)pLysS cells by IPTG induction. The MBP-sMSTN1pro was expressed in soluble forms, and affinity purified using amylose resin. The affinity purified MBP-sMSTN1pro suppressed MSTN activity in vitro. The results suggest that MBP is probably a useful fusion partner in producing bioactive MSTN prodomains of various animal species in E. coli."
0,"pH adjustment would be of advantage in improving the water holding capacity of muscle proteins. The objective of this study was to evaluate the addition of fish sarcoplasmic protein (SP) solution, which was adjusted to pH 3.0 or 12.0, neutralized to pH 7.0, and lyophilized to obtain the acid- and alkaline-treated SP samples, on the functional properties of the chicken myofibrillar protein induced by microbial transglutaminase (MTG). The solubility of alkaline-treated SP was higher than that of the acid counterpart; however, those values of the two pH-treated samples were lower than that of normal SP (p<0.05). All SP solutions were mixed with myofibrillar proteins (MP) extracted from chicken breast, and incubated with MTG. The shear stresses of MP with acid- and alkaline-treated SP were higher than that of normal SP. The thermal stability of MP mixture reduced upon adding SP, regardless of the pH treatment. The breaking force of MP gels with acid-treated SP increased more than those of alkaline-treated SP, while normal SP showed the highest value. The MP gel lightness increased, but cooking loss reduced, with the addition of SP. Smooth microstructure of the gel surface was observed. These results indicated that adjusting the pH of SP improved the water holding capacity of chicken myofibrillar proteins induced by MTG. "
0,"A 4×3 factorial experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of two dietary protein sources (mixed fishmeal/plant protein-, and plant protein- based diet), two dietary lipid levels (10% and 20%) and three water temperatures (10°C, 14°C, and 18°C) on the growth performance, nutrient utilization efficiencies and mitochondrial enzyme complex activities in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (average weight±SD, 39.5±5g) over a 180day rearing period. At the end of the experiment, weight gain (WG), condition factor (CF), and feed efficiency (FE) were significantly affected by diet×temperature interaction (P<0.05). Specific growth rate (SGR) was significantly affected by increasing temperature (P<0.05). The plant protein-based diets led to a higher CF than the mixed fishmeal/plant protein-based diets. The protein productive value (PPV), protein efficiency ratio (PER), lipid efficiency ratio, (LER) and lipid productive value (LPV) were all significantly affected by diet×temperature interaction (P<0.05). The diet×temperature interaction also had significant effects on mitochondrial enzyme complexes II, V and citrate synthase in the liver, complexes II and IV in the intestine, and complex IV in the muscle (P<0.05). Temperature had a significant main effect on the activity of the enzymatic complexes I and III in the liver, complex III and citrate synthase in the intestine, and complexes I, II, III, V and citrate synthase in the muscle (P<0.05). Diet had a significant main effect on complexes I and III in the liver, complexes II and III for the intestine and complexes I and II in the muscle (P<0.05). The significant temperature x diet interaction observed has practical ecological implications explicitly demonstrating how changes in temperature regimens as anticipated in the rising global temperature can influence organismal performance in relation to changes in dietary formulations (replacing fishmeal based diet with plant protein based ingredients). To illustrate the practical application of the observations from this study, the most economical and cost effective way to produce rainbow trout would be to use 40/10PP diet at 14°C because fish fed this treatment had a weight gain comparable to that of the fish fed the more expensive experimental diets (40/10 FM/PP, 40/20 FM/PP, and 40/20 PP)."
0,"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a well-characterized cytokine that plays key roles in cellular responses to infection, inflammation, and immunological challenges in mammals. In this study, we identified and analyzed a grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) ortholog of IL-1β (gcIL-1β), examined its expression patterns in various tissues in both healthy and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated specimens, and evaluated its proinflammatory activities. The gcIL-1β gene consists of seven exons and six introns. The full-length cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 813 nucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibits a characteristic IL-1 signature but lacks the typical IL-1β converting enzyme cleavage site that is conserved in mammals. In the phylogenetic tree, IL-1βs from grass carp and other members of the Cyprinidae family clustered into a single group. Expression pattern analysis revealed that gcIL-1β is constitutively expressed in all 11 tissues examined, and LPS stimulation leads to significant up-regulation in muscle, liver, intestine, skin, trunk kidney, head kidney, and gill. Recombinant grass carp IL-1β (rgcIL-1β) was generated prokaryotically as a fusion protein of Trx-rgcIL-1β. An anti-rgcIL-1β polyclonal antibody (rgcIL-1β pAb) was raised in mice against the purified Trx-rgcIL-1β. Western blot analysis confirmed that rgcIL-1β pAb reacted specifically with gcIL-1β in C. idella kidney (CIK) cells. Quantitative real-time PCR data indicated that intestinal mRNA expression levels of endogenous IL-1β, IL-1R2, and TNF-α were significantly up-regulated following Trx-rgcIL-1β exposure. The inhibitory activities of rgcIL-1β pAb against the inflammatory response were confirmed in a model of Aeromonas hydrophila-induced intestinal inflammation. Our immunohistochemical study revealed that the degree and intensity of inflammatory cell infiltration are fully consistent with the observed mRNA expression patterns of these key inflammatory genes. Taken together, these data suggest that gcIL-1β plays a critical role in the proinflammatory response in the grass carp intestine."
0,"Antigenic peptides presented on MHC class I molecules to cytotoxic T-cells are generated in the cytosol by the 20S proteasome. Two activators PA28-alpha and PA28-beta, which are inducible by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), activate the latent 20S proteasome, thus playing an important role in the processing of MHC class I antigen. Molecular properties and function in the MHC class I antigen processing of PA28 have been well studied and documented in mammals while little is known in fish. In the present study, we reported the cloning of a PA28-beta gene homologue from the spleen of large yellow croaker (Pseudosciana crocea), an economically important marine fish (LycPA28-beta). The full-length cDNA of LycPA28-beta is 1133 nucleotides (nt) encoding a protein of 245 amino acids (aa), with a putative molecular weight of 27.7 kDa. The deduced protein shares 76, 69, 61, 60, 59, 57 and 57% sequence identity to sequences found in zebrafish, flounder, pig, rat, mouse, cattle and human, respectively. The deduced LycPA28-beta contains a PA28-beta subunit-specific insert in the region corresponding to the KEKE motif of the known PA28-alpha (Region B), a conserved activation loop (Region C) and a highly homologous C-terminal region among all three PA28 subunits (Region E), and a characteristic proline-rich motif (Region A) and a potential protein kinase C recognition site (Region D). Western blot analysis of various tissues indicated that LycPA28-beta was constitutively expressed in kidney, liver, spleen and intestine, and weakly expressed in muscle tissue, but not detected in gills, heart and brain. The LycPA28-beta expression was significantly up-regulated in kidney, liver, spleen, intestine and muscle tissues, and also induced in gills after 72 h of treatment with a viral micmic, polyinosinic polycytidynic acid (poly I:C). The transcriptional analysis of LycPA28-beta and MHC class I alpha-chain (alpha-chain) and beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) in spleens of poly I:C-induced large yellow croaker was further performed by RT-PCR. The results showed that the expression of LycPA28-beta and class I alpha-chain and beta(2)m genes was coordinately up-regulated by poly I:C, suggesting that induction of the MHC class I antigen processing and presentation pathway may be required for the antiviral immune response triggered poly I:C in large yellow croaker."

By developing enzyme technologies for protein recovery and modification, production of a broad spectrum of food ingredients and industrial products may be possible. Hydrolyzed vegetable and milk proteins are widely used food ingredients. There are few hydrolyzed fish protein foods with the exception of East Asian condiments and sauces. This review describes various manufacturing techniques for fish protein hydrolysates using acid, base, endogenous enzymes, and added bacterial or digestive proteases. The chemical and biochemical characteristics of hydrolyzed fish proteins are discussed. In addition, functional properties of fish protein hydrolysates are described, including solubility, water-holding capacity, emulsification, and foam-forming ability. Possible applications of fish protein hydrolysates in food systems are provided, and comparison with other food protein hydrolysates where pertinent."
0,"Galectins are a family of endogenous lectins with β-galactosides affinity, playing significant roles in the innate immunity of vertebrates and invertebrates. In this report, a new galectin-9 cDNA was identified and characterized in large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea (designated as LcGal-9). The complete cDNA sequence of LcGal-9 was 1795 bp, with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1032 bp encoding 343 amino acids. The putative LcGal-9 protein contained two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) connected by a linker peptide, with each carrying two conserved β-galactoside binding motifs H-NPR and WG-EE-, and it possessed neither a signal peptide nor a transmembrane domain. LcGal-9 protein shared 43-74% identity with galectin-9 sequences from other species. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that LcGal-9 mRNA was constitutively expressed in all tissues examined, predominately expressed in liver, spleen, gill, kidney, head-kidney and intestine. Western blot analysis showed that LcGal-9 protein was highly expressed in liver, spleen, intestine, kidney, head-kidney, skin, gill, and heart, but not detected in muscle and plasma. LcGal-9 mRNA transcripts were induced by poly I:C in the liver (from 6 h to 48 h), spleen (at 12 h) and head-kidney (at 12 h and 24 h). In contrast, Vibrio parahaemolyticus caused a significant down-regulation in these three tissues, except for in spleen of 48 h and head-kidney of 3 h. Post-infection with Cryptocaryon irritans, the transcripts were dramatically up-regulated in gill, skin, spleen and head-kidney during initial infection period, while significant down-regulation afterward was also observed both in spleen and head-kidney. The recombinant LcGal-9 (named as rLcGal-9) purified from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) demonstrated hemagglutination against human, rabbit and L. crocea in a Ca(2+)-independent manner, which was inhibited by α-Lactose and LPS. The results of bacterial agglutination assays showed that rLcGal-9 was able to agglutinate Gram-negative bacteria V. alginolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila in a Ca(2+)-independent manner. By immunohistochemistry assay, significant increases of LcGal-9 protein appeared in the spleen stimulated with poly I:C (for 12 h) and V. parahaemolyticus (for 48 h) compared with the control. Based on the collective data, LcGal-9 might play an important role in innate immune responses, especially defense against Gram-negative bacteria in L. crocea."
0,"Telomerase expression has long been linked to promotion of tumor growth and cell proliferation in mammals. Interestingly, telomerase activity (TA) has been detected in skeletal muscle for a variety of fish species. Despite this being a unique feature in fish, very few studies have investigated the potential role of TA in muscle. The present study was set to prove the concepts that muscle telomerase in fish is related to body growth, and more specifically, to muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis in vivo. Moreover, muscle TA can be influenced by biotic factors and modulated by environmental stress. Using three fish species, mangrove red snapper (Lutjanus argentimaculatus), orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), and marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma), the present work reports for the first time that fish muscle TA was sensitive to the environmental stresses of starvation, foodborne exposure to benzo[a]pyrene, and hypoxia. In marine medaka, muscle TA was coupled with fish growth during early life stages. Upon sexual maturation, muscle TA was confounded by sex (female>male). Muscle TA was significantly correlated with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein expression (Pearson correlation r=0.892; p≤0.05), which was coupled with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) cell proliferation, but not associated with apoptosis (omBax/omBcl2 ratio) in muscle tissue. The results reported here have bridged the knowledge gap between the existence and function of telomerase in fish muscle. The underlying regulatory mechanisms of muscle TA in fish warrant further exploration for comparison with telomerase regulation in mammals. "
0,"Coilia nasus is one important commercial anadromous species which mainly distributed in the Yangtze River in China. At present, it has been on the ""National Key Protective Species List"" because of its severe resource damage. Lipid metabolism is very important during its long-distance migration. To make further research on lipid metabolism of C. nasus, we cloned lipoprotein lipase gene with homologous cloning method. A full-length cDNA of LPL of C. nasus was cloned from liver which covered 3537 bp with a 1519 bp open reading frame encoding 505 deduced amino acids whose molecular mass was 57.5 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point was 7.58. The deduced amino acids had high similarity with the reported LPL sequence of other species. It had typical conserved domain of LPL protein containing catalytic triad, N-linked glycosylation sites and conserved heparin-binding site, etc. We adopted quantitative real-time RT-PCR method to detect the mRNA expression of LPL of C. nasus in ten tissues including mesenteric adipose, liver, muscle, stomach, spleen, heart, head kidney, trunk kidney, gill and brain with β-actin as internal reference. LPL expressed in all the detected tissues. The highest expression was in mesenteric adipose, and followed by liver, muscle, stomach. Lipid expressed lowly in spleen, heart, head kidney, trunk kidney, gill and brain. The research on the cloning and differential expression of LPL of C. nasus will lay foundation for further research on lipid metabolism of C. nasus."
0,"Isoelectric solubilization and precipitation (ISP) processing uses pH shifts to separate protein from fish frames, which may increase commercial interest for silver carp. Texture and color properties of gels made from silver carp protein recovered at different pH strategies and organic acid types were compared. ISP was applied to headed gutted silver carp using 10 mol L(-1) sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and either glacial acetic acid (AA) or a (1:1) formic and lactic acid combination (F&L). Protein gels were made with recovered protein and standard functional additives."
1,"Texture profile analysis and the Kramer shear test showed that protein gels made from protein solubilized at basic pH values were firmer, harder, more cohesive, gummier and chewier (P < 0.05) than proteins solubilized under acidic conditions. Acidic solubilization led to whiter (P < 0.05) gels, and using F&L during ISP yielded whiter gels under all treatments (P < 0.05)."
2,Gels made from ISP-recovered silver carp protein using organic acids show potential for use as a functional ingredient in restructured foods.
0,"The NLRC3-like (NLRC3L) molecule from the goldfish transcriptome database was identified and characterized. Quantitative gene expression analysis revealed the highest mRNA levels of NLRC3L were in the spleen and intestine, with lower mRNA levels observed in muscle and liver. Goldfish NLRC3L was differentially expressed in goldfish immune cell populations with highest mRNA levels measured in PBLs and macrophages. We generated a recombinant form of the molecule (rgfNLRC3L) and an anti-CT-NLRC3L IgG. Treatment of goldfish primary kidney macrophages in vitro with ATP, LPS and heat-killed Aeromonas salmonicida up-regulated the NLRC3L mRNA and protein. Confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that goldfish rgfNLRC3L interacted with apoptosis-associated spec-like protein (ASC) in eukaryotic cells, indicating that NLRC3L may participate in the regulation of the inflammasome responses. The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that NLRC3L over-expression did not cause the activation of NF-κB, but that it cooperated with RIP2 to down-regulate NF-κB activation. Our results indicate that the NLRC3L may function as a regulator of NLR pathways in teleosts."
0,"Gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) is a widely cultured fish; however, muscle development regulation is poorly known. Myogenesis can be activated by the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs: MyoD, Myf5, myogenin and MRF4) and by endocrine signals from the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) axis. We cultured gilthead sea bream myocytes to better understand the role of IGFs in muscle growth and differentiation through the regulation of MRFs expression. First, we studied the expression pattern during culture development of IGFs and IGF-I splice variants. The expression of igf-II was highest at the beginning of the culture and decreased when the cells started to differentiate, similarly to that observed for total igf-I. Igf-Ib showed a paralleled expression pattern as that of total igf-I, whereas igf-Ic was more stable during culture progression. Next, we analyzed the expression of IGFs and MRFs after incubation of cells at day 4 with GH, IGF-I, IGF-II and combinations of them at 3, 6 and 18 h. IGF-II increased myod2 and myf5 expression, genes involved in early muscle cell proliferation. Moreover, IGF-I caused an increase on mrf4 and myogenin expression, both involved in the later stages of development corresponding to differentiation. Regarding the regulation of IGFs expression, igf-I was stimulated by GH and IGF-II alone and combined, whereas igf-II expression was increased in response to IGF-I, suggesting a nice model of crossed regulation. Overall, the present model could be very useful to understand the different regulatory roles of these endocrine and transcription factors on fish myogenesis."
0,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in various physiological processes, especially during the formation and maintenance of various organs. In this study, we first obtained and characterized twenty BMP genes from the Trachinotus ovatus genome (designated as ToBMPs). Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis both indicated that the predicted amino acid sequences of ToBMP were highly conserved with corresponding homologs of other species. Moreover, a comparative analysis was performed with seven representative vertebrate genomes and found difference in number of BMP3 genes in different species, which three members, BMP3a, BMP3b-1, and BMP3b-2, existed in diploid T. ovatus, but there were four and two members in tetraploidized Cyprinus carpio (BMP3a-1, BMP3a-2, BMP3b-1, and BMP3b-2) and diploid Danio rerio (BMP3a and BMP3b), respectively. The amino acid alignment and genomic structure analysis of ToBMP3 also suggested that the BMP3 gene had expanded in T. ovatus. Furthermore, tissue expression patterns were assessed for the small intestine, liver, white muscle, brain, spleen, fin, gill, head kidney, stomach, blood, and gonads. It was discovered that BMP1, BMP2, BMP3a, BMP4, BMP6, BMP7b, BMP11, and BMP16 were ubiquitously expressed in all the tissues tested. To study the regulatory function of BMP in response to the intake of different types of food, the expression changes in BMP mRNAs were detected by qRT-PCR, and the results showed that the majority of the BMP genes had the highest mRNA levels in the small intestine and liver after ingesting pelleted feed. Our data provide a useful resource for further studies on how paralogous genes may have different expression profiles in T. ovatus."
0,"The mechanisms by which meat enhances human absorption of non-heme iron remain unknown. Recently, anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) muscle protein hydrolysate (AMPH) was found to mediate the formation of nanosized ferric hydrolysis products in vitro. The current paper evaluates the effects of AMPH on the bioavailability and the intestinal speciation of non-heme iron in rats, followed by an investigation of cellular uptake pathways of in vitro-formed AMPH-stabilized nanosized ferric hydrolysis products (ANPs) by polarized human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells. The hemoglobin regeneration efficiencies in anemic rats followed the order ferric citrate (9.79 ± 2.02%) < commercial bare α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (16.37 ± 6.65%) < mixture of ferric citrate and AMPH (40.33 ± 6.36%) ≈ ferrous sulfate (40.88 ± 7.67%) < ANPs (56.25 ± 11.35%). Percentage contents of intestinal low-molecular-weight iron in the groups of FC+AMPH, FeSO4, and ANPs were significantly lower than the corresponding hemoglobin regeneration efficiencies (P < 0.05), providing strong evidence for the involvement of nanosized iron in intestinal iron absorption from FC+AMPH, FeSO4, and ANPs. Calcein-fluorescence measurements of the labile iron pool of polarized Caco-2 cells revealed the involvement of both divalent transporter 1 and endocytosis in apical uptake of ANPs, with endocytosis dominating at acidic extracellular pH. Overall, AMPH enhancement of non-heme iron absorption involves a nanoparticle-mediated mechanism. "
0,"Myosin heavy chain (MYH) genes belong to a multigene family, and the regulated expression of each member determines the physiological and contractile muscle properties. Among these, MYH6, MYH7, and MYH14 occupy unique positions in the mammalian MYH gene family because of their specific expression in slow/cardiac muscles and the existence of intronic micro(mi) RNAs. MYH6, MYH7, and MYH14 encode miR-208a, miR-208b, and miR-499, respectively. These MYH encoded miRNAs are designated as myomiRs because of their muscle-specific expression and functions. In mammals, myomiRs and host MYHs form a transcription network involved in muscle fiber-type specification; thus, genomic positions and expression patterns of them are well conserved. However, our previous studies revealed divergent distribution and expression of MYH14/miR-499 among teleosts, suggesting the unique evolution of myomiRs and host MYHs in teleosts. Here, we examined distribution and expression of myomiRs and host MYHs in various teleost species. The major cardiac MYH isoforms in teleosts are an intronless gene, atrial myosin heavy chain (amhc), and ventricular myosin heavy chain (vmhc) gene that encodes an intronic miRNA, miR-736. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that vmhc/miR-736 is a teleost-specific myomiR that differed from tetrapoda MYH6/MYH7/miR-208s. Teleost genomes also contain species-specific orthologs in addition to vmhc and amhc, indicating complex gene duplication and gene loss events during teleost evolution. In medaka and torafugu, miR-499 was highly expressed in slow/cardiac muscles whereas the expression of miR-736 was quite low and not muscle specific. These results suggest functional diversification of myomiRs in teleost with the diversification of host MYHs. "
0,"Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a highly conserved and multi-functional molecular chaperone, plays an essential role in cellular metabolism and stress response. In this study, HSP90 cDNA named MaHSP90 was cloned from Wuchang bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) gills by using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The full-length MaHSP90 cDNA is 2674 bp and consists of a 3',5'-untranslated region and a 2250-bp open reading frame encoding a 750-amino acid long protein. Identity analysis revealed that the amino acid sequence of MaHSP90 is highly conserved. Homology analysis and structure comparison further indicated that MaHSP90 should be the β isoform member of the HSP90 family. MaHSP90 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in the liver, heart, muscle, gill, intestine, kidney, and brain. The MaHSP90 mRNA levels under nitrite stress were analyzed using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR); the mRNA levels significantly increased at 3, 6, and 12 h after nitrite exposure in the gills and then stabilized between 24 and 48 h. Furthermore, a similar relationship between mRNA expression (qRT-PCR) and HSP90 protein levels (densitometric band analysis) was found. Transcriptional analysis of caspase-8 and caspase-9 expression in the gills of juvenile M. amblycephala after a 48-h exposure to nitrite suggested that MaHSP90 expression is related positively with nitrite-induced apoptosis. Fish exposed to nitrite also showed gill damage. Our results suggest that MaHSP90 mRNA is constitutively expressed in various tissues and inducible in the gills under nitrite stress, suggesting its important role in nitrite stress response. "
0,"Inhibition of endogenous protease is a rapid and feasible approach to control the proteolysis proceeding of post mortem fish flesh. In the present study, the in vitro inhibitory effects of common edible di- and tri-carboxylic acids and salts on endogenous proteolytic activities as well as myofibrillar disassembly and degradation mediated by crude enzyme of grass carp muscle were investigated. The results showed that among the compounds tested, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid and malic acid were the most effective inhibitor for cathepsin B, L and calpain, with IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 7.76 to 30.13 mM, from 32.38 to 65.12 mM, from 1.06 to 6.76 mM, respectively. Also, relatively lower Ki (ranging from 1.04 to 43.21 mM) of these compounds were found towards cathepsin B, L and calpain. Incubation of myofibrillar protein with crude enzyme in the presence of di- and tri-carboxylic compounds could remarkably suppress the dissociation and degradation of myosin heavy chain (MHC), and ameliorate the loss of heat shock protein (HSP) in myofibrils, with tartaric acid and fumaric acid proved more effective than other compounds, possibly implicating their application as potential and efficient inhibitors for quality control of fish muscle products."
0,"B chromosomes (Bs) are extra elements observed in diverse eukaryotes, including animals, plants and fungi. Although Bs were first identified a century ago and have been studied in hundreds of species, their biology is still enigmatic. Recent advances in omics and big data technologies are revolutionizing the B biology field. These advances allow analyses of DNA, RNA, proteins and the construction of interactive networks for understanding the B composition and behavior in the cell. Several genes have been detected on the B chromosomes, although the interaction of B sequences and the normal genome remains poorly understood."
1,"We identified 727 miRNA precursors in the A. latifasciata genome, 66% which were novel predicted sequences that had not been identified before. We were able to report the A. latifasciata-specific miRNAs and common miRNAs identified in other fish species. For the samples carrying the B chromosome (B<sup>+</sup>), we identified 104 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs that are down or upregulated compared to samples without B chromosome (B<sup>-</sup>) (p < 0.05). These miRNAs share common targets in the brain, muscle and gonads. These targets were used to construct a protein-protein-miRNA network showing the high interaction between the targets of differentially expressed miRNAs in the B<sup>+</sup> chromosome samples. Among the DE-miRNA targets there are protein-coding genes reported for the B chromosome that are present in the protein-protein-miRNA network. Additionally, Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to nuclear matrix organization and response to stimulus are exclusive to DE miRNA targets of B<sup>+</sup> samples."
2,This study is the first to report the connection of B chromosomes and miRNAs in a vertebrate species. We observed that the B chromosome impacts the miRNAs expression in several tissues and these miRNAs target several mRNAs involved with important biological processes.
0,"Superoxide dismutases (SODs), as the prime antioxidant enzymes, present the first line of defense against oxidative stress caused by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in organism. In the study, two distinct members of SOD family were cloned and analyzed in Qihe crucian carp Carassius auratus (designated as CaCu/ZnSOD and CaMnSOD, respectively). The full-length cDNA of CaCu/ZnSOD is 759 bp, containing a 5' -untranslated region (UTR) of 39 bp, a ORF (including stop codon, TAG) of 465 bp and a 3'-UTR of 255 bp. The ORF of CaCu/ZnSOD encodes a protein of 154 amino acids (aa), in which, two Cu/ZnSOD signature (<sup>45</sup>GFHVHAFGDNT<sup>55</sup> and <sup>139</sup>GNAGGRLACGVI<sup>150</sup>) and four conserved amino acids for Cu/Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (H64, H72, H81 and D84) were observed. The full-length CaMnSOD cDNA (960 bp) consists of a 5'-UTR of 114 bp, a ORF of 675 bp and a 3'-UTR of 231 bp, the ORF of CaMnSOD encodes a 224 aa protein with a 26 aa mitochondrial-targeting sequence (MTS) in the N-terminus, and four conserved amino acids for manganese binding (H52, H100, D185 and H189) were observed. Multiple alignment and the structural analysis revealed two Cu/ZnSOD signature motifs and a MnSOD signature motif as well as the invariant binding sites for Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup> in CaCu/ZnSOD and Mn<sup>2+</sup> in CaMnSOD. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that CaCu/ZnSOD was homologous to cytosolic Cu/ZnSODs, and CaMnSOD was high similarity with mitochondrial MnSODs from other fish. The tissue distribution analysis demonstrated that CaCu/ZnSOD and CaMnSOD were highly expressed in liver, heart and muscle. The dynamic expressions of CaCu/ZnSOD and CaMnSOD were observed after the challenges with Aeromonas hydrophila or LPS, which generally increased in liver, gill, kidney and spleen, while, the mRNA expressions were down-regulated at some time points in head kidney. The enzyme activities increased after A. hydrophila or LPS challenge, compared to the control. In this study, the molecular structures and functional motifs of CaCu/ZnSOD and CaMnSOD were determined, and it is crucial for us to understand the biological functions of SODs. The highest level in liver showed that the function of liver to remove ROS is much more important. The obvious responses of mRNA expression levels and enzyme activities to pathogens indicate the important roles of CaCu/ZnSOD and CaMnSOD in antioxidant defense in C. auratus."
0,"The CITED3 protein is a non-DNA-binding transcriptional co-regulator involved in the regulation of various transcriptional responses against hypoxia stress. Here, we characterized two paralogs Cited3 genes (Cited3a and Cited3b) from blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala), which is a hypoxia-sensitive species. Both genes have an open reading frame of 756 and 723 bp; encoded a protein of 251 amino acid and 240 amino acid, respectively; and they shared a sequence identity of 67%. In adult fish, both Cited3a and Cited3b mRNAs were highly expressed in kidney tissues. In contrast, they were detected in the skin, muscle, and gonad at extraordinarily low levels. During embryogenesis, both Cited3a and Cited3b mRNAs were maternally deposited in eggs and fluctuated from the zygote to the 44-hpf (hours post-fertilization) larvae. Whole-mount in situ hybridization demonstrated that both Cited3a and Cited3b mRNAs were transcribed in the brain, gut, and tailbud at 12 hpf, and at the brain and gut at 24 hpf, and at the brain at 36 hpf embryos. Hypoxic treatment led to upregulated expression of the Cited3 genes during embryogenesis. Under hypoxia, both Cited3a and Cited3b genes in the kidney and brain and Cited3a genes in the liver were significantly upregulated. These results suggest that hypoxia was associated with increases in mRNA levels for both Cited3a (kidney, brain, liver) and Cited3b (kidney and liver)."
0,"Chopping and stirring methods were used to prepare surimi gels in a way that preserved their inherent characteristics while maintaining or improving their textural properties and microstructures. In samples with the same-salt levels, the stirring process led to a higher gel strength than the chopping process (P < 0.05), improved the gels' water holding capacity (WHC) and viscosity, and slightly decreased the amount of salt-soluble protein. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance showed that the stirring method improved the WHC of the product more than the chopping method. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the surimi gels produced by stirring with 3% salt had a denser and more uniform microstructure than those produced by chopping with 2% or 3% salt. Overall, the results indicated that the stirring method is comparatively more gentle than the chopping method and can produce high-quality surimi gels that retain their original properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The study examines a gentle breaking method for improving the textural properties of surimi gels while remaining their original characteristics of fish. Stirring processing, as a low-intensity breaking method, can significantly increase the gel strength and slightly increase the WHC of surimi gels compared to chopping methods. The method produces high-quality products with nutritional value, which benefits both producers and customers."
0,"Grass carp, with an annual production exceeding 4 × 10(6) t in China in 2009, has not been developed into a high-value product. In this study the antioxidant activities and functional properties of grass carp protein hydrolysates prepared with Alcalase 2.4L (HA) and papain (HP) were investigated. The hydrolysate with strongest radical-scavenging activity and reducing power was assessed further for changes in its antioxidant activity during simulated gastrointestinal digestion."
1,"As the degree of hydrolysis (DH) increased, the metal-chelating activity of both HA and HP increased while their reducing power and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH(•) )-scavenging activity decreased (P < 0.05). At the same DH, HP possessed higher DPPH(•) -scavenging activity and reducing power than HA (P < 0.05). The metal-chelating activity of HP with 10% DH was significantly increased after in vitro gastrointestinal metabolism (P < 0.05). Regarding their functional properties, all hydrolysates were more than 81% soluble over a wide range of pH (3-8). At the same DH, HP showed higher emulsion activity index but lower solubility and foaming capacity than HA."
2,Grass carp protein hydrolysates showed high solubility over a wide pH range and could be used as natural antioxidants in food systems.
0,Immunoglobulins (Igs) distributed among systemic immune tissues and mucosal immune tissues play important roles in protecting teleosts from infections in the pathogen-rich aquatic environment. Teleost IgZ/IgT subclasses with different tissue expression patterns may have different immune functions.
1,"In the present study, a novel secreted IgZ heavy chain gene was cloned and characterized in common carp (Cyprinus carpio). This gene exhibited a different tissue-specific expression profile than the reported genes IgZ1 and IgZ2. The obtained IgZ-like subclass gene designated CcIgZ3, had a complete open reading frame contained 1650 bp encoding a protein of 549 amino acid residues. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CcIgZ3 was grouped with carp IgZ2 and was in the same branch as IgZ/IgT genes of other teleosts. Basal expression detection of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) in healthy adult common carp showed that CcIgZ3 transcripts were widely expressed in systemic immune tissues and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues. CcIgZ3 was expressed at the highest levels in the head kidneys, gills, and gonads, followed by the spleen, hindgut, oral epithelium, liver, brain, muscle, foregut, and blood; it was expressed at a very low level in the skin. The transcript expression of CcIgZ3 in leukocytes isolated from peripheral blood cells was significantly higher than that in leukocytes isolated from the spleen. Different groups of common carp were infected with Aeromonas hydrophila via intraperitoneal injection or immersion. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that significant differences in CcIgZ3 mRNA levels existed between the immersion and injection groups in all the examined tissues, including the head kidney, spleen, liver, and hindgut; in particular, the CcIgZ3 mRNA level in the hindgut was higher in the immersion group than in the injection group. The different routes of A. hydrophila exposure in common carp had milder effects on the IgM response than on the CcIgZ3 response. Further study of the relative expression of the IgH gene during the development of common carp showed that the tissue-specific expression profile of CcIgZ3 was very different from those of other genes. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the CcIgZ3 mRNA level increased gradually in common carp during the early larval development stage from 1 day post fertilization (dpf) to 31 dpf with a dynamic tendency similar to those of IgZ1 and IgZ2, and IgM was the dominant Ig with obviously elevated abundance. Analyses of the tissue-specific expression of IgHs in common carp at 65 dpf showed that CcIgZ3 was expressed at mucosal sites, including both the hindgut and gill; in contrast, IgZ1 was preferentially expressed in the hindgut, and IgZ2 was preferentially expressed in the gill. In addition to RT-qPCR analysis, in situ hybridization was performed to detect CcIgZ3-expressing cells and IgM-expressing cells. The results showed that CcIgZ3 and IgM transcripts were detectable in the spleens, gills, and hindguts of common carp at 65 dpf."
2,"These results reveal that CcIgZ3 gene transcripts are expressed in common carp during developmental stage not only in systemic tissues but also in mucosal tissues. CcIgZ3 expression can be induced in immune tissues by A. hydrophila challenge via immersion and intraperitoneal injection with significantly different expression profiles, which indicates that CcIgZ3 is involved in the antimicrobial immune response and might play an important role in gut mucosal immunity."
0,"The nutrient and energy demand of sexual maturation in many fish cultivars causes structural change to key contractile proteins and thereby, affects fillet firmness. Thermal denaturation and viscoelastic properties of white muscle from diploid (2N; fertile) and triploid (3N; sterile) female rainbow trout were investigated at 6 age endpoints from July 2008 through spawning in March 2009. Differential scanning calorimetry showed, in March, that the actin denaturation temperature (T(max,actin)) of 2N females was higher than that observed in 3N females (78.17 versus 77.27 °C). From 35 to 45 °C, viscoelastic measurement revealed that muscle from 2N females and younger fish (July, 16 mo) had greater elasticity (lower tan δ) than muscle from 3N females and older fish (November to March; 20 to 24 mo), respectively. The highest elastic response and the firmest fillets were observed in July. Raw fillets were softer (Allo-Kramer shear; P < 0.05) from September to January (288.77 g/g on average) than those collected in July (475.15 g/g) and March (366.79 g/g). Soft fillets became firmer after cooking except for January samples. Greater cook yield and softer fillets were observed in January compared to December. Lipid accumulation in 3N females may lubricate muscle fibers and protect them from losing functionality during the spawning season for animals on a high plane of nutrition."
1,"The relationship between fish maturation, measured as egg development, and chemical characteristics of fillets from fertile and sterile fish was evaluated. Thermal denaturation and viscoelastic characterization revealed changes in stability and gelling properties of muscle proteins that were related to changes in fillet texture."
0,"Muscle atrophy is a physiological response to diverse physiological and pathological conditions that trigger muscle deterioration through specific cellular mechanisms. Despite different signals, the biochemical changes in atrophying muscle share many common cascades. Muscle deterioration as a physiological response to the energetic demands of fish vitellogenesis represents a unique model for studying the mechanisms of muscle degradation in non-mammalian animals. A salmonid microarray, containing 16,006 cDNAs, was used to study the transcriptome response to atrophy of fast-switch muscles from gravid rainbow trout compared with sterile fish. Eighty-two unique transcripts were upregulated and 120 transcripts were downregulated in atrophying muscles. Transcripts having gene ontology identifiers were grouped according to their functions. Muscle deterioration was associated with elevated expression of genes involved in the catheptic and collagenase proteolytic pathways; the aerobic production, buffering, and utilization of ATP; and growth arrest; whereas atrophying muscle showed downregulation of genes encoding a serine proteinase inhibitor, enzymes of anaerobic respiration, muscle proteins as well as genes required for RNA and protein biosynthesis/processing. Therefore, gene transcription of the trout muscle atrophy changed in a manner similar to mammalian muscle atrophy. These changes result in an arrest of normal cell growth, protein degradation, and decreased glycolytic cellular respiration that is characteristic of the fast-switch muscle. For the first time, other changes/mechanisms unique to fish were discussed including genes associated with muscle atrophy."
0,"The influence of dietary protein intake on muscle mass in adults remains unclear. Our objective was to investigate the association between protein intake and muscle mass in 31,278 men and 45,355 women from the Lifelines Cohort. Protein intake was estimated by food frequency questionnaire and muscle mass was estimated from 24 h urinary creatinine excretion. The age range was 18⁻91 years and mean total protein intake was 1.0 ± 0.3 g/kg/day. Across increasing quartiles of total protein intake, animal protein intake, and fish/meat/egg protein intake, creatinine excretion significantly increased in both men (+4% for total and +6% for fish/meat/egg protein intake, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and women (+3% for total and +6% for fish/meat/egg protein intake, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The associations were not systematically stronger or weaker with increasing age, but associations were strongest for young men (26⁻45 years) and older women (>75 years). The association between total protein intake and muscle mass was dependent on physical activity in women (<i>p</i> interaction < 0.001). This study suggests that total protein intake, animal protein intake, and in particular fish/meat/egg protein intake may be important for building and preserving muscle mass. Dietary protein sources should be further studied for their potential to build and preserve muscle mass."
0,"In fishes, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) stimulates growth and differentiation but also plays a role in a number of other processes including osmoregulation, metabolism, immune response and reproduction. This study presents the cDNA encoding multiple prepro-IGF-I transcripts obtained from red drum, Sciaenopsocellatus, and examines differential expression in select adult tissues and during ontogeny. Four distinct transcripts were sequenced which were identical in the coding region for the signal (132 bp) and mature (204 bp) peptides but differed in the coding region of the E peptide by the exclusion of 117 (Ea-1), 81 (Ea-2) or 36 (Ea-3) bp compared to the 222 bp present in Ea-4. Analysis of the pertinent portion of the genomic sequence of this gene suggests that the transcripts are a result of alternative splicing. This is the first report of the expression of all four known prepro-IGF-I transcripts in a teleost other than a salmonid. The deduced amino acid sequences exhibited 70-95% identity with teleosts and somewhat lower identity to other vertebrates (60-75%). Three of the 4 transcripts (Ea-2, Ea-3, Ea-4) were expressed in the liver, ovary, spleen, gall bladder, brain, red muscle, pancreas and spinal cord of adults. Only the Ea-4 transcript was expressed in adult stomach tissue while no signal was detected in pituitary, retina, intestine, adipose or white muscle. In contrast, all 4 transcripts were expressed throughout ontogeny. The apparent expression of the Ea-1 transcript only during the larval stage may indicate a developmental role for this E peptide in red drum."
0,"Cryptocaryon irritans is an important protozoan ciliate, which has led to heavy economic losses in marine aquaculture. Previous studies have indicated that C. irritans infection could induce the migration of neutrophils to infection sites. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) mainly exists in the cytoplasmic granules of the neutrophil and performs its function by a unique enzymatic capacity to produce hypohalous acid and other toxic oxidants. To determine the involvement of MPO and neutrophils against C. irritans infection in the host, we amplified MPO cDNA (EcMPO) from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). The open reading frame (ORF) of EcMPO encodes a putative polypeptide of 770 amino acids and has typical structural characteristics of mammalian MPO, including a signal peptide, a propeptide, a light chain, a heavy chain, and a peroxidase domain. Bioinformatics analysis has demonstrated that the most important functional sites in mammalian MPO were also conserved in grouper and other piscine MPO, implying the functional conservation of this protein during evolution. A rabbit anti-MPO recombinant protein polyclonal antibody was produced, which could recognize the native MPO protein. The expression of EcMPO was higher in the lympho-hematopoietic organs, such as head kidney, trunk kidney, spleen, but lower in muscle, heart, and brain. After infection with C. irritans, the EcMPO transcript was significantly up-regulated at specific time points in the infection sites (skin and gill) and systemic immune organs (head kidney and spleen); The number of EcMPO positive cells first increased and then decreased in the gill, but was still higher than the control after 7 days. These results demonstrated that EcMPO and its positive cells may be involved in anti-C. irritans infection in the grouper, which is attributed to the innate immune mechanisms of the host against parasite infection."
0,"Cortisol is an essential regulator of neuroendocrine stress responses in teleosts. Cortisol predominantly affects target tissues through the genomic pathway, which involves interacting with cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors, and thereby, modulating stress-response gene expressions. Cortisol also produces rapid effects via non-genomic pathways, which do not involve gene transcription. Although cortisol-mediated genomic pathways are well documented in teleosts, non-genomic pathways are not fully understood. Moreover, no studies have focused on the contribution of non-genomic cortisol pathways in compensatory stress responses in fish. In this study, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) skeletal myotubes were stimulated with physiological concentrations of cortisol and cortisol-BSA, a membrane-impermeable agent, resulting in an early induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This production was not suppressed by transcription or translation inhibitors, suggesting non-genomic pathway involvement. Moreover, myotube preincubation with RU486 and NAC completely suppressed cortisol- and cortisol-BSA-induced ROS production. Subcellular fractionation analysis revealed the presence of cell membrane glucocorticoid receptors. Finally, cortisol-BSA induced a significant increase in ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation, as well as in CREB-dependent transcriptional activation of the pgc1a gene expression. The obtained results strongly suggest that cortisol acts through a non-genomic glucocorticoid receptor-mediated pathway to induce ROS production and contribute to ERK/CREB/PGC1-α signaling pathway activation as stress compensation mechanisms.

0,"This study tested the hypothesis that increased growth in channel catfish is associated with expression of the genes that code for uncoupling proteins (UCP) 2 and 3, members of the mitochondrial channel proteins involved in nutrient sensing and metabolism. The specific objective was to contrast the levels of UCP2 messenger RNA (mRNA) in fast vs slow growing catfish as well as in fed vs fasted catfish. Two distinct UCP2 transcripts were identified and named UCP2a and UCP2b, respectively. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence of catfish UCP2s were highly similar to UCP2 and other UCPs from other fish and mammals (>75%). Expression of UCP2a mRNA was detectable at very low levels in various metabolically active tissues, whereas the expression of UCP2b mRNA was readily detectable in the muscle and heart. In a 21-wk feeding study, fish that grew faster had a greater percent body fat at the end of the study (P < 0.01). Expression of UCP2b mRNA tended to be lower (P < 0.10) in fast growing fish in the middle of the study although levels were similar at the beginning and the end of the study. In the fed vs fasted study, expression of UCP2b mRNA in muscle was increased (P < 0.05) in fish assigned to 30 d of fasting. Our results suggest that, based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities and tissue mRNA distribution, catfish UCP2b may be the analog to UCP3. Moreover, our results suggest selection toward growth and associated fat accumulation appears to be independent of muscle UCP2b mRNA expression and UCP2b-mediated mechanisms."
0,"A comparative experiment with Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) postsmolts was conducted over 35 days to provide insight into how growth, respiration, energy metabolism and the growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) system are regulated at elevated sea temperatures. Rainbow trout grew better than Atlantic salmon, and did not show reduced growth at 19 °C. Rainbow trout kept at 19 °C had increased blood hemoglobin concentration compared to rainbow trout kept at 13 °C, while salmon did not show the same hemoglobin response due to increased temperature. Both species showed reduced length growth and decreased muscle glycogen stores at 19 °C. Circulating IGF-1 concentration was higher in rainbow trout than in Atlantic salmon, but was not affected by temperature in either species. Plasma IGF-binding protein 1b (IGFBP-1b) concentration was reduced in Atlantic salmon reared at 19 °C after 15 days but increased in rainbow trout at 19 °C after 35 days. The igfbp1b mRNA level in liver showed a positive correlation to plasma concentrations of glucose and IGFBP-1b, suggesting involvement of this binding protein in carbohydrate metabolism at 19 °C. At this temperature muscle igfbp1a mRNA was down-regulated in both species. The muscle expression of this binding protein correlated negatively with muscle igf1 and length growth. The plasma IGFBP-1b concentration and igfbp1b and igfbp1a expression suggests reduced muscle igf1 signaling at elevated temperature leading to glucose allostasis, and that time course is species specific due to higher thermal tolerance in rainbow trout."
0,"High-pressure processing (HPP) is a technology of growing interest for food preservation, due to its ability to control the activity of degradative enzymes. The effect of three variables (pressure levels of 100, 250, and 400 MPa; pressure holding times of 0, 5, 15, and 30 min; and pressurization rates of 8 and 14 MPa/s) on the activity of the enzymes acid phosphatase, cathepsins (B and D), lipase, and calpains was studied using sea bass fillets as a case study model. Additionally, the effect of HPP on sarcoplasmic proteins was studied by SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing electrophoreses. The increase in pressure level and holding time decreased the protein concentration in sarcoplasmic extracts, and also the activity of calpains. As compared to nontreated samples, acid phosphatase activity was lower at 400 MPa, and for cathepsin D lower activities were observed at 100 and 400 MPa. The increase in pressurization rate increased the activity of cathepsin D, lipase, and calpains, although it was not always significant. In contrast, cathepsin B and lipase activities were less affected by HPP treatments. Electrophoresis separation of sarcoplasmic proteins showed that the intensity of many protein bands changed mainly due to pressure level and holding time. The results of this study suggest that HPP causes lysosomes disruption and also denaturation, aggregation, and fragmentation of sarcoplasmic proteins, and this evidence might be related to the decrease in enzymes activity especially at 400 MPa. In conclusion, HPP can be a potential tool to control the activity of degradative enzymes, which might prevent the softening of sea bass muscle due to autolytic reactions. "
0,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor that promotes and inhibits cell migration, plays a complex and important role in adverse vascular remodeling. Little is known about the effects of pharmacological PAI-1 inhibitors, an emerging drug class, on migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs), crucial mediators of vascular remodeling. We investigated the effects of PAI-039 (tiplaxtinin), a specific PAI-1 inhibitor, on SMC and EC migration in vitro and vascular remodeling in vivo."
1,"PAI-039 inhibited SMC migration through collagen gels, including those supplemented with vitronectin and other extracellular matrix proteins, but did not inhibit migration of PAI-1-deficient SMCs, suggesting that its antimigratory effects were PAI-1-specific and physiologically relevant. However, PAI-039 did not inhibit EC migration. PAI-039 inhibited phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of signal transducers and activators of transcription-1 in SMCs, but had no discernable effect on signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 signaling in ECs. Expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, a motogenic PAI-1 receptor that activates Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription-1 signaling, was markedly lower in ECs than in SMCs. Notably, PAI-039 significantly inhibited intimal hyperplasia and inflammation in murine models of adverse vascular remodeling, but did not adversely affect re-endothelialization after endothelium-denuding mechanical vascular injury."
2,"PAI-039 inhibits SMC migration and intimal hyperplasia, while having no inhibitory effect on ECs, which seems to be because of differences in PAI-1-dependent low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1/Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 signaling between SMCs and ECs. These findings suggest that PAI-1 may be an important therapeutic target in obstructive vascular diseases characterized by neointimal hyperplasia."
0,"Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1 (AIF-1) is an inflammation responsive protein that is mainly produced by immunocytes. As a pro-inflammatory cytokine, AIF-1 is a key moderator in host immune defense reaction. However, the inflammatory properties of AIF-1 in freshwater fish still hasn't been clearly elucidated. In the present study, AIF-1 was identified from grass carp (Ctenopharynogodon idella). It's transcript was found in all examined tissues including brain, spleen, kidney, liver, heart, while a relative low level in red muscle, gill, thymus, white muscle, intestine and fin. Furthermore, AIF-1 transcription and expression level decreased in spleen and didn't change a lot in kidney with cadmium induction, respectively. The result indicated that grass carp AIF-1 might be involved in cadmium-induced stress."
0,"Follistatin (FST) is a single-chain gonadal protein involving in various biological effects. FST plays important roles in not only ovary development but also body growth, whereas myostatin (MSTN) negatively regulates muscle growth. In this study, FST gene in bighead carp (HynFST) was cloned and characterized. A 5797 bp genomic sequence of HynFST, consisting six exons and five introns were cloned. The full-length cDNA of HynFST (2134 bp) has an open reading fragment encoding a polypeptide of 349 amino acids. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that FSTs are conserved throughout the vertebrates and HynFST belongs to FST-1 isoform. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the HynFST were identified and three of them (g.2443 T > C, g.2852 T > C and g.5483A > G) were significantly associated with four growth-related traits. The average body weight of those fish with the combined genotype (CC CC GG) was 12.15-22.63% higher than that of triplotype (TT TT AA) in two bighead carp populations. HynFST was expressed in most of the development stages and various tissues with highest level in ovary. The co-expression results for FST and MSTN in brain and muscle of divergent weight groups showed that FST may inhibit MSTN expression, thus enhancing growth in bighead carp. Our results suggest that FST has significant genetic effects on the regulation of early growth in bighead carp. This study would facilitate the elucidation of multiple functions of FST gene in fish and exploration of the potentials as a gene marker in selective breeding programs for growth of bighead carp."
0,Toxic cyanobacterial blooms result in the production of an organic biomass containing cyanotoxins (e.g. microcystins) and an elevated ammonia concentration in the water environment. The ingestion of toxic cyanobacteria and exposure to ammonia are grave hazards for fish. The present study assessed the effects of dietary toxic cyanobacteria and ammonia exposure on the flesh quality of blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala).
1,"Dietary toxic cyanobacteria and ammonia exposure had no impact on fish growth performance, fillet proximate composition and drip loss, whereas it significantly decreased fillet total amino acids, total essential amino acids, hardness and gumminess, and increased fillet ultimate pH as well as malondialdehyde content. However, there was no significant interaction between dietary toxic cyanobacteria and ammonia exposure on these parameters. Additionally, dietary toxic cyanobacteria significantly increased fillet initial pH, thaw loss and protein carbonyl content, whereas ammonia exposure did not."

0,"Chronic stress and the associated elevation in corticosteroid levels increase muscle protein catabolism. We hypothesized that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated restriction of muscle glucose availability may play a role in the increased protein catabolism during chronic stress. To test this, we generated a ubiquitous GR knockout (GRKO) zebrafish to determine the physiological consequence of glucocorticoid stimulation on muscle metabolism and growth. Adult GRKO zebrafish had higher body mass, and this corresponded to an increased protein and lipid, but not carbohydrate, content. GRKO fish were hypercortisolemic, but they elicited a higher cortisol response to an acute stressor. However, the stressor-induced increase in plasma glucose level observed in the wild type was completely abolished in the GRKO fish. Also, the muscle, but not liver, capacity for glucose uptake was enhanced in the GRKO fish, and this corresponded with a higher hexokinase activity in the mutants. Zebrafish lacking GR also showed a higher capacity for protein synthesis, including increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4B, higher expression of heat shock protein cognate 70, and total protein content. A chronic fasting stressor reduced body mass and muscle protein content in adult zebrafish, but this decrease was attenuated in the GRKO compared with the wild-type fish. Metabolomics analysis revealed that the free pool of amino acid substrates used for oxidation and gluconeogenesis were lower in the fasted GRKO fish muscle compared with the wild type. Altogether, chronic stressor-mediated GR signaling limits muscle glucose uptake, and this may play a role in protein catabolism, leading to the growth suppression in fish."
0,"Salt solubility of pH-shift isolated herring (Clupea harengus) muscle proteins was studied in relation to pH exposure and microstructure using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Using protein solubilization at pH 11.2 with subsequent precipitation at pH 5.5, salt solubility of the proteins decreased from 78 to 17%. By precipitating the alkali-solubilized proteins at the pH of native herring muscle, 6.5, salt solubility only decreased to 59%, proving that pH values between 6.5 and 5.5 affected protein salt solubility more than the pH cycle 6.5 → 11.2 → 6.5. Precipitation at pH 5.5 resulted in hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and S-S bridges, whereas precipitation at pH 6.5 resulted only in the formation of hydrophobic interactions. The alkaline pH-shift isolation process severely rearranged the protein microstructure, with precipitation at pH 6.5 forming a finer, more homogeneous network than precipitation at pH 5.5. The former protein isolate also contained less lipid oxidation products and formed more deformable gels, without affecting protein yield."
0,"Sebastes schlegelii are an important species of fish found in the coastal areas of the Korea with significant commercial importance. Most studies thus far have been primarily focused on environmental factors; behavioural patterns, aquaculture, diseases and limited genetic studies with little to none related to either microRNAs (miRNAs) or transposable elements (TE)."
1,"In order to understand biological roles of TE-derived miR-1269a, we examined expression pattern for miR-1269a and its target gene, KSR2, in various tissues of Sebastes schlegelii. Also, we performed luciferase reporter assay in HINAE cells."
2,"UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/) was used to examine which TE is associated with miR-1269a. For the target genes for miR-1269a, the target genes associated with the miRNA were identified using miRDB (http://www.mirdb.org/) and TargetScan 7.1 (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_71/). A two-step miRNA kit, HB miR Multi Assay Kit™ System. I was used for the analysis of TE-derived miRNA expression patterns. The 3'UTR of KSR2 gene was cloned into the psiCHECK-2 vector. Subsequently co-transfected with miR-1269a mimics to HINAE cells for luciferase reporter assay."
3,"MiR-1269a was found to be derived from LTR retrotransposon, MLT2B. LTR-derived miR-1269a was highly expressed in the muscle, liver and gonad tissues of Sebastes schlegelii, but KSR2 revealed high expression in the brain. Co-transfection of KSR2 and miR-1269a mimic to HINAE cells showed high activity of miR-1269a in relation to KSR2."
4,LTR-derived miR-1269a showed enhancer activity with relation to KSR2 in Sebastes schlegelii. The data may be used as a foundation for further investigation regarding correlation of miRNA and target genes in addition to other functional studies of biological significance in Sebastes schlegelii.
0,"Chemokines are small, structurally related chemotactic cytokines characterized by the presence of conserved cysteine residues. In the present study, we identified the cDNA of a CXC chemokine from Oplegnathus fasciatus, designated as OfCXCL12. An open reading frame of 297 bp encoded a 98 amino acid peptide with a putative signal peptide of 23 amino acids. The CXC family-specific small cytokine domain (SCY), which is highly conserved among vertebrates, was located between residues 29 and 87. The characteristic conserved cysteine residues in the CXC motif of OfCXCL12 were separated by tyrosine (Y). Similar to other vertebrate CXCL12 proteins, OfCXCL12 also lacked the ELR motif and hence belongs to ELR(-) subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct clades, consisting of fish and tetrapod CXCL12 homologs. Constitutive expression with significantly higher levels of OfCXCL12 mRNA transcription was detected in immune-related organs, including the head kidney, spleen, and kidney. Infection with bacterial and viral agents led to significant upregulation of mRNA expression in both the head kidney and spleen, in a stimulant-specific manner. Stimulation of peripheral blood leukocytes by the mitogen concanavalin-A significantly induced OfCXCL12 transcription. Results from the present study suggest an important role for OfCXCL12 in immune defense against bacterial and viral infection in rock bream."
0,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a highly conserved and multi-functional protein kinase that plays important roles in both intracellular energy balance and cellular stress response. In the present study, molecular characterization, tissue distribution and gene expression levels of the AMPK α1 and α2 genes from turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) under salinity stress are described. The complete coding regions of the AMPK α1 and α2 genes were isolated from turbot through degenerate primers in combination with RACE using muscle cDNA. The complete coding regions of AMPK α1 (1722 bp) and α2 (1674 bp) encoded 573 and 557 amino acids peptides, respectively. Multiple alignments, structural analysis and phylogenetic tree construction indicated that S. maximus AMPK α1 and α2 shared a high amino acid identity with other species, especially fish. AMPK α1 and α2 genes could be detected in all tested tissues, indicating that they are constitutively expressed. Salinity challenges significantly altered the gene expression levels of AMPK α1 and α2 mRNA in a salinity- and time-dependent manners in S. maximus gill tissues, suggesting that AMPK α1 and α2 played important roles in mediating the salinity stress in S. maximus. The expression levels of AMPK α1 and α2 mRNA were a positive correlation with gill Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activities. These findings will aid our understanding of the molecular mechanism of juvenile turbot in response to environmental salinity changes."
0,"During skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, membrane depolarizations activate the sarcolemmal voltage-gated L-type Ca(2+) channel (Ca(V)1.1). Ca(V)1.1 in turn triggers opening of the sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) release channel (RyR1) via interchannel protein-protein interaction to release Ca(2+) for myofibril contraction. Simultaneously to this EC coupling process, a small and slowly activating Ca(2+) inward current through Ca(V)1.1 is found in mammalian skeletal myotubes. The role of this Ca(2+) influx, which is not immediately required for EC coupling, is still enigmatic. Interestingly, whole-cell patch clamp experiments on freshly dissociated skeletal muscle myotubes from zebrafish larvae revealed the lack of such Ca(2+) currents. We identified two distinct isoforms of the pore-forming Ca(V)1.1alpha(1S) subunit in zebrafish that are differentially expressed in superficial slow and deep fast musculature. Both do not conduct Ca(2+) but merely act as voltage sensors to trigger opening of two likewise tissue-specific isoforms of RyR1. We further show that non-Ca(2+) conductivity of both Ca(V)1.1alpha(1S) isoforms is a common trait of all higher teleosts. This non-Ca(2+) conductivity of Ca(V)1.1 positions teleosts at the most-derived position of an evolutionary trajectory. Though EC coupling in early chordate muscles is activated by the influx of extracellular Ca(2+), it evolved toward Ca(V)1.1-RyR1 protein-protein interaction with a relatively small and slow influx of external Ca(2+) in tetrapods. Finally, the Ca(V)1.1 Ca(2+) influx was completely eliminated in higher teleost fishes."
0,"Loss of skeletal muscle mass and function is a hallmark of aging. This phenomenon has been related to a dysregulation of mitochondrial function and proteostasis. Calorie restriction (CR) has been demonstrated to delay aging and preserve function until late in life, particularly in muscle. Recently, we reported the type of dietary fat plays an important role in determining life span extension with 40% CR in male mice. In these conditions, lard fed mice showed an increased longevity compared to mice fed soybean or fish oils. In this article, we analyze the effect of 40% CR on muscle mitochondrial mass, autophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics markers in mice fed these diets. In CR fed animals, lard preserved muscle fibers structure, mitochondrial ultrastructure, and fission/fusion dynamics and autophagy, not only compared to control animals, but also compared with CR mice fed soybean and fish oils as dietary fat. We focus our discussion on dietary fatty acid saturation degree as an essential predictor of life span extension in CR mice."
0,"Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), a eurythermal fish, live in environments from -1.8 to 20°C, with some populations facing substantial annual variation in environmental temperature. These different temperature regimes pose distinct challenges to locomotion by smelt. Steady swimming performance, red muscle function and muscle myosin content were examined to assess the prediction that cold acclimation by smelt will lead to improved steady swimming performance and that any performance shift will be associated with changes in red muscle function and in its myosin heavy chain composition. Cold acclimated (4°C) smelt had a faster maximum steady swimming speed and swam with a higher tailbeat frequency than warm acclimated (10°C) smelt when tested at the same temperature (10°C). Muscle mechanics experiments demonstrated faster contractile properties in the cold acclimated fish when tested at 10°C. The red muscle of cold acclimated smelt had a shorter twitch times, a shorter relaxation times and a higher maximum shortening velocity. In addition, red muscle from cold acclimated fish displayed reduced thermal sensitivity to cold, maintaining higher force levels at 4°C compared to red muscle from warm acclimated fish. Immunohistochemistry suggests shifts in muscle myosin composition and a decrease in muscle cross-sectional area with cold acclimation. Dot blot analysis confirmed a shift in myosin content. Rainbow smelt do show a significant thermal acclimation response to cold. An examination of published values of maximum muscle shortening velocity in fishes suggests that smelt are particularly well suited to high levels of activity in very cold water."
0,"To improve the quality of processed grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) products and control the accumulation of hazardous substances therein, minced grass carp slices were salted for 6 h at room temperature and then inoculated with mixed starter cultures of Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hansen and Monascus anka and fermented for 12 h at 30 degrees C. The changes in some characteristics and biogenic amine contents of the fermented muscles were investigated."
1,"During the 12 h fermentation at 30 degrees C, muscles inoculated with mixed starter cultures showed a rapid decrease in pH from 6.0 to 5.1 and suppression of the growth of enterobacteria and pseudomonads. The fermented muscles exhibited better colour, appearance, flavour and overall acceptability than the control (P < 0.05). The changes in non-protein nitrogen and free amino acid contents of the fermented muscles and in their sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles indicated that severe hydrolysis of muscle proteins occurred during fermentation. The accumulation of biogenic amines in the muscles was efficiently reduced by fermentation with mixed starter cultures."
2,"Fermentation with mixed starter cultures of L. casei, S. lactis, S. cerevisiae Hansen and M. anka significantly improved the characteristics of grass carp muscles and controlled the accumulation of biogenic amines."
0,"The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α is known to have a direct action on skeletal muscle in mammals. However, little is known regarding the potential effects of cytokines on nonimmune tissues, particularly in skeletal muscle, in fish. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of recombinant trout TNF-α (rtTNF-α) on skeletal muscle carbohydrate metabolism in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We used a primary cell culture of muscle cells from rainbow trout to show that rtTNF-α stimulates glucose uptake in myoblasts and myotubes at concentrations that do not affect the viability of the cells, requiring de novo protein synthesis as shown by the impairment of rtTNF-α-stimulated glucose uptake by cycloheximide. With the use of specific inhibitors, we show that rtTNF-α-stimulated glucose uptake is mediated by the p38MAPK, NF-κB, and JNK pathways. Additionally, we provide evidence that the stimulatory effects of rtTNF-α on glucose uptake in trout skeletal muscle cells may be caused, at least in part, by an increase in the amount of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane. Incubation of trout muscle cells with conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated trout macrophages, enriched in TNF-α, increased glucose uptake. Our results indicate that recombinant, as well as native trout TNF-α, directly stimulates glucose uptake in trout muscle cells and provide evidence, for the first time in nonmammalian vertebrates, for a potential regulatory role of TNF-α in skeletal muscle metabolism."
0,"Effects of basic amino acids, lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg), at different levels (0%, 0.5%, and 1%, based on mince weight) on properties of striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) mince gel containing low salt (LS) and high salt (HS) were investigated. Without Lys or Arg addition, HS gel had the higher textural properties including hardness, chewiness, as well as cohesiveness than LS gel (P < 0.05) and the highest values were achieved when 1% Arg was incorporated in both LS and HS gels (P < 0.05). Arg had no effect on acceptability of mince gel. However, whiteness was decreased in HS gel when Arg was applied. Autolysis of gel was lower in HS gel containing Arg. No differences in protein patterns among all gel samples were found. Addition of Arg could increase the gelling ability of both LS and HS mince during heating as evidenced by higher storage modulus (G') and viscous modulus (G″). Mince gel added with Arg had orderly interconnected structure and their microstructure was finer than that without Arg. Therefore, Arg could be used in LS gel from striped catfish mince, in which quality of gel was equivalent to HS counterpart. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Basic amino acid, especially arginine (Arg) with guanidinium group, could increase repulsive force between protein molecules at low-salt concentration (0.5%). This resulted in high solubilization of muscle proteins, whereas gel formation or gel strength was higher than that containing high salt (2.5% to 3.5%). Thus, Arg could be used for production of fish mince gel containing low salt with lowered health risk."
0,"RanGTPases are highly conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to human and have been implicated in many aspects of nuclear structure and function. In our previous study, it was revealed that the RanGTPase was up-regulated in large yellow croaker challenged by pathogen. However, the mechanism of RanGTPase in immunity remains unclear. In this investigation, on the basis of protein interaction, it was found that RanGTPase interacted with myosin light chain (designated as LycMLC), a crucial protein in the process of phagocytosis. Furthermore, it was found and characterized in this marine fish for the first time. The full-length cDNA of LycMLC was 771bp, including a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 36bp, 3'-terminal UTR of 279bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 456bp encoding a polypeptide of 151 amino acids. RT-PCR analysis indicated that LycMLC gene was constitutively expressed in the 9 tissues examined, including kidney, liver, gill, muscle, spleen, skin, heart, intestine and blood. The result of quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed the highest expression in muscle and the weakest expression in skin. Time course analysis showed that LycMLC expression was obviously up-regulated in blood after immunization with either poly I:C or formalin-inactive Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio parahaemolyticus. It indicated that the highest expression was 4.5 times (at 24h) as much as that in the control (P<0.05) challenged by poly I:C and 5.0 times (at 24h) challenged by bacteria. These results suggested that LycMLC might play an important role in large yellow croaker defense against the pathogen infection. Therefore our study revealed a novel pathway concerning immunity of RanGTPase by the direct interaction with the cytoskeleton protein, which would help to better understand the molecular events in immune response against pathogen infection in fish."
0,"This study evaluated the protective effect of α-lipoic acid (LA) on n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs)-induced lipid peroxidation in grass carp. The result indicated that diets with n-3 HUFAs increased the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) (P < 0.05), thereby inducing lipid peroxidation in liver and muscle of grass carp. Meanwhile, compared with control group, the hepatosomatic index (HSI) and kidney index (KI) of grass carp were markedly increased in n-3 HUFAs-only group. However, diets with LA remarkably inhibited the n-3 HUFAs-induced increase of HSI, KI, and MDA level in serum, liver and muscle (P < 0.05). Interestingly, LA also significantly elevated the ratio of total n-3 HUFAs in fatty acid composition of muscle and liver (P < 0.05). Furthermore, LA significantly promoted the activity of antioxidant enzymes in serum, muscle and liver of grass carp (P < 0.05), including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione s-transferase (GST). The further results showed that LA significantly elevated mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes with promoting the mRNA expression of NF-E2-related nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2) and decreasing Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) mRNA level. From the above, these results suggested that LA could attenuate n-3 HUFAs-induced lipid peroxidation, remit the toxicity of the lipid peroxidant, and protect n-3 HUFAs against lipid peroxidation to promote its deposition in fish, likely strengthening the activity of antioxidant enzymes through regulating mRNA expressions of antioxidant enzyme genes via mediating Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathways."
0,"The present study aimed to measure tissue protein synthesis in sea bream fed isonitrogenous diets that contained 63, 55 and 50 % fishmeal; in the latter two diets, 16 and 27 % of the fishmeal protein was replaced with plant protein. Over a 35 d period, there were no differences in feed intake, growth or feed efficiency among the three diets. Protein metabolism was then measured in the liver and white muscle tissue as rates of protein synthesis and as the capacity for protein synthesis before feeding (0 h) and at different times after feeding (4-48 h). Diet did not have a significant effect on protein synthesis or on the capacity for protein synthesis in either tissue. The capacity for protein synthesis was not affected by time after feeding, and overall mean values were 81·02 (se 1·68) and 4·07 (se 0·94) mg RNA/g protein for the liver and white muscle, respectively. Liver and white muscle fractional rates of protein synthesis were significantly higher at 4-8 h, intermediate at 12 h and were not different among pre-feeding (0 h), 24 and 48 h. Overall, the indices of protein metabolism measured at various times over 48 h following feeding were closely aligned with measurements of feeding, growth and growth efficiency established over a longer time scale."
0,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is one of critical signal transduction proteins of interferon (IFN) pathway and the structure and function of this protein have been well identified in mammals, but the information about the STAT1 is still limited in teleost fishes. In the present study, the full-length cDNA sequence of STAT1 (AjSTAT1) in Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) was identified and characterized. Multiple alignment of the amino acid sequence showed that the AjSTAT1 protein has the typical conserved domains including the amino-terminal, coiled-coil, DNA-binding, linker, Src homology 2 (SH2), transcriptional activation domains (TAD). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed a broad expression for AjSTAT1 in a wide range of tissues, with the predominant expression in liver, followed by the spleen, intestine, gills, skin, kidney, and the very low expression in heart and muscle. The AjSTAT1 expressions in liver, spleen and kidney were significantly induced following injection with LPS, the viral mimic poly I:C, and Aeromonas hydrophila infection. In vitro, the AjSTAT1 transcripts of Japanese eel liver cells were significantly enhanced by the treatment of poly I:C or the stimulation of the high concentration of Aeromonas hydrophila (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/mL and 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> cfu/mL). Subcellular localization showed that in the natural state AjSTAT1was uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm, but AjSTAT1 was found to aggregated in the cytoplasm as well as partly in the nucleus after the stimulation of LPS and poly I:C. These results collectively suggested AjSTAT1 is an important transcription factor possibly involved in Japanese eel defense against viral and bacterial infection."
0,"Interferon regulatory factors (irfs) are a family of genes that encode transcription factors with important roles in regulating the expression of Type I interferons (IFNs) and other genes associated with related pathways. irfs have multitudinous functions in growth, development and regulation of oncogenesis. In this study, three irf family members (irf2, irf7, irf9) were identified and characterized in Megalobrama amblycephala at the mRNA and amino acid levels. M. amblycephala irfs share a high sequence homology with other vertebrate irfs. Constitutive expression levels of the three genes were detected (using qPCR) in all studied tissues: low to medium in kidney, gills, heart and muscle, and high in liver, spleen, intestine and blood. qPCR was also used to analyze the dynamic expression patterns of irfs in different embryonic development stages: irf2 is not activated during the embryonic development, whereas irf9 appears to play important roles around hatching and during the larval development. Transcripts of all three studied irfs were upregulated after stimulation by Aeromonas hydrophila bacterium in liver, spleen, head kidney and trunk kidney, whereas downregulation was observed in intestine and gills. The results show that these three irfs are likely to be important factors in the blunt snout bream immune system. They also provide a foundation for studying the origin and evolution of the innate immune system in the blunt snout bream."
0,"Propolis can be used as growth enhancer due to its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immune-stimulant properties, but its effects on morphometry and muscle gene expression are largely unknown. The present study evaluates the influence of propolis on muscle morphometry and myostatin gene expression in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) bred in net cages. Reversed males (GIFT strain) with an initial weight of 170 ± 25 g were distributed in a (2 x 4) factorial scheme, with two diets (DPRO, commercial diet with 4% propolis ethanol extract and DCON, commercial diet without propolis, control) and four assessment periods (0, 35, 70, and 105 experimental days). Muscles were evaluated at each assessment period. Histomorphometric analysis classified the fiber diameters into four groups: <20 μm; 20-30 μm; 30-50 μm; and > 50 μm. RT-qPCR was performed to assess myostatin gene expression. Fibers < 20 µm diameter were more frequent in DPRO than in DCON at all times. Fiber percentages >30 µm (30-50 and > 50 µm) at 70 days were 25.39% and 40.07% for DPRO and DCON, respectively. There was greater myostatin gene expression at 105 days, averaging 1.93 and 1.89 for DCON and DPRO, respectively, with no significant difference in any of the analyzed periods. Propolis ethanol extract did not affect the diameter of muscle fibers or the gene expression of myostatin. Future studies should describe the mechanisms of natural products' effects on muscle growth and development since these factors are highly relevant for fish production performance."
0,"Primextra is a commercial herbicide formulation generally used in agriculture for weed control. The present study was designed to investigate the oxidative stress biomarkers and biochemical responses in the tissues of Clarias gariepinus juvenile exposed to primextra. Fish were exposed to 0.24 and 0.47 mgL(-1) corresponding to 1/20 and 1/10th of 96 h LC50 of the herbicide. The liver and muscle tissues were sampled on day 1, 5, 10 and 15 and results showed concentration and time dependent significant increase (p < 0.05) in the values of lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and alkaline phosphatase in both tissues. A marked significant increase (p < 0.05) was observed in the values of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and glucose in the liver while a mixed trend in their values were observed in the muscle. The values of superoxide dismutase and protein in both tissues were comparable to the control except on day 15 in the liver where the values significantly declined. The condition factor was not directly affected but values of hepatosomatic index were significantly reduced. The present findings revealed that primextra induced toxic stress even at sublethal concentrations resulting in alterations of the studied parameters which were more evident in the fish liver than in the muscle tissue."
0,"In order to be able to modulate and improve the function of PPARγ and decrease further some metabolic diseases of M. amblycephala, we have cloned and identified the full-length cDNA of PPARγ in M. amblycephala and examined its transcription patterns at different embryo developmental stages and in different tissues of adult and immature fish. We also accurately normalized seven reference genes by GeNorm and calculated their gene transcription normalization factors. The full-length of PPARγ was 1968 bp, consisting of 218 bp 5'-untranslated region, 1,533 bp open reading frame encoding 510 amino acids residues and 217 bp 3'-untranslated region. M. amblycephala PPARγ peptide was predicted to consist of 4 conserved domains, i.e. N-terminal domain, DNA-binding domain, ligand binding domain and flexible hinge region. PPARγ mRNAs were detected in all studied tissues of adult and immature fish including adipose tissue, gill, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, white muscle, intestine, brain and gonad. In adult fish, PPARγ transcription in liver was highest, followed by gills and it was lowest in female gonads. Moreover, the differences among liver, gill, intestine/brain, spleen/white muscle, kidney and female gonads were greatly significant (p<0.01). The transcription of PPARγ in male gonads was significantly higher than in female gonads (p<0.01). In immature fish, the transcription of PPARγ was highest in intestines followed by adipose tissue, and it was lowest in hearts and white muscles. A great difference was observed (p<0.01) in the transcription of PPARγ among adipose tissue, intestines, liver and heart/white muscles. At different embryo developmental stages, PPARγ transcription in unfertilized spermatozoa was greatly higher than in unfertilized ovum (p<0.01) and it was highest among different embryo developmental stages. The transcription of PPARγ increased gradually during 2 cells stage and 32 cells stage and then decreased until gastrula stage at which it was lowest. The transcription of PPARγ increased again on first day after hatching. There was a significant difference (p<0.01) in the transcription of PPARγ between 2 cells stage and 32 cells stage and it was same between 32 cells stage and gastrula stage. These results revealed that transcription of PPARγ showed a tissue-dependent regulation and a developmental-stage-dependent regulation that are valuable and helpful to improve the function of PPARγ and to decrease some metabolic diseases in the culture of M. amblycephala."
0,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, plays an important regulatory role in the activation of T cells induced by mitogenic or antigenic stimuli. However, the immunologic property of MIF in freshwater fish is limitedly known by now. In the present study, MIF gene was identified in grass carp. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the molecular weight of grass carp MIF protein was 12.377 kDa and it could also bind to CD74. MIF gene was predominantly expressed in immune tissues including spleen and head kidney, then liver, skin, gill, intestine and blood, while a relative low level expression in heart, brain, fat and red muscle. The predicted receptor and tissues distribution of MIF implied the immunologic activity of grass carp MIF. Then grass carp MIF antigen and the polyclonal antibodies against it were prepared. Using cadmium as an immunosuppressive agent, MIF expression in spleen and head kidney was depressed in a dose-dependent manner with cadmium consumption. On the same time, white blood cell count decrease displayed a similar pattern with MIF expression, which suggested a possible positive correlation between MIF and white blood cell count. Thereafter, MIF enhanced the viability of grass carp peripheral blood leukocytes and inhibited cell apoptosis with depressed reactive oxygen species production in vitro. In addition, recombinant grass carp MIF promoted tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL1β) and interleukin 6 (IL6) secretion from peripheral blood leukocytes. These results indicated the immunologic property of grass carp MIF."
0,"The technological properties of raw fish are influenced by the changes in protein structure under heating, which determines the texture and quality of the product. The aim of the study was to examine the protein denaturation temperature and the rheological properties of Baltic herring muscle tissue. The thermal properties were determined by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method and the rheological properties were determined using dynamic oscillatory tests. DSC showed four peaks associated with denaturing transformations of myosin (39.59 °C), sarcoplasm (51.67 °C), connective tissue (63.16 °C), and actin (74.40 °C). Analysis showed that not all transformations occurred according to the same kinetic model. The first two and the last peak are described by 1st order kinetics, while peak 3 is described by 2nd order kinetics. Correlating the changes in fish tissue structure during heating with the rheological characteristics provides more information. The obtained kinetics models correlated very strongly with the results of model testing. Rheological changes of the G' and G"" values had two inflexion points and demonstrate a high degree of convergence with the DSC changes of herring muscle tissue from 20 to 85 °C."

Bioactive peptides from food proteins offer major potential for incorporation into functional foods and nutraceuticals. The aim of this paper is to present an outline of the bioactive peptides identified in the muscle protein of meat to date, with a focus on muscle protein from domestic animals and fish. The majority of research on bioactives from meat sources has focused on angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidant peptides."
0,"Parvalbumin is well known as the major fish allergen that is typically present in high amounts in muscles, where it functions in calcium buffering and is involved in the relaxation process in fast-twitch muscles. We show in our current study that parvalbumin-like protein is present in high amounts in carp spermatozoa. It is the first report to demonstrate the presence of parvalbumin-like protein in fish spermatozoa. Using antibodies produced against purified carp parvalbumin-like protein, we localized parvalbumin-like protein to spermatids and spermatozoa. Our results indicate that parvalbumin-like protein appeared during the final stage of spermatogenesis. We also detected high amounts of parvalbumin-like protein in carp seminal plasma but not in blood plasma which suggests that its function may be specific for the male reproductive tract. The activation mechanism of carp sperm movement is not fully understood, but in carp, Ca2+ influx is the prerequisite for the initiation of sperm motility. The appearance of parvalbumin-like protein in high amounts in mature spermatozoa coincides with their acquiring the ability to move. The presence of parvalbumin-like protein in spermatozoa and seminal plasma strongly suggests that parvalbumin-like protein is an important part of the Ca2+-mediated mechanism of sperm activation in carp."
0,"An experiment was conducted to evaluate the role of different lipotropes in modulating immunity and biochemical plasticity under conditions of sublethal low-dose pesticide-induced stress in fish. Labeo rohita fish fingerlings were divided in two sets with one set of fish continuously exposed to low-dose endosulfan (1/10th of 96-h LC50) for 21 days, the other was unexposed, and both sets of fish were fed with practical diets supplemented with either 2 % lecithin, 0.5 % betaine, or 0.1 % choline and compared against unsupplemented diet. Low-dose endosulfan exposure had adverse effects (P < 0.05/P < 0.01) on hematological profile (erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit), serum protein (total protein, albumin, and globulin) and lipid profile (cholesterol and triglyceride), anti-oxidative status (ascorbic acid content of muscle, liver, brain, and kidney and activity of anti-oxidative enzymes: catalase and superoxide dismutase), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle and brain), immunological attributes (WBC count, albumin to globulin ratio, phagocytic activity, and serum cortisol), and metabolic plasticity as revealed from enzyme activities (muscle lactate dehydrogenase, liver and kidney glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase-G6PDH activity). Dietary lipotropes prevented these effects completely or partially and the effects were lipotrope dependent. Kinetics (maximum velocity value V max, catalytic efficiency and Michaelis constant K m) of G6PDH enzyme from crude extracts of liver and kidney indicated inhibition due to endosulfan but lipotropes could protect enzyme and showed a stabilizing effect. The supplements also helped maintain integrity of histoarchitecture of the hepatocytes in endosulfan-exposed fish to a great extent. Feeding lipotropes to fish reared in endosulfan-free water also improved hematological and serum protein and lipid profiles and were immunostimulatory. In conclusion, dietary lipotropes, especially betaine and lecithin at the levels used, improve erythropoiesis, serum protein and lipid profile, anti-oxidant status, immunocompetence, neurotransmission, and protect the livers of L. rohita fingerlings even when continuously exposed to low-dose endosulfan.

0,"In mammals, new evidence has demonstrated the important role of the autophagic/lysosomal pathway in regulating muscle mass and identified the transcription factor FoxO3 as a key factor of the control of this proteolytic system by inducing several autophagy-related genes. In contrast, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of autophagy have not been investigated in teleosts, known to exhibit different muscle growth dynamics. The present work aimed to characterize both in vivo and in vitro the transcriptional regulation of several major genes involved in autophagy (LC3B, gabarapl1, atg12l, atg4b) in the white skeletal muscle of rainbow trout. We found that fasting fish for 14days or serum depletion of trout myocytes strongly induces the expression of all studied genes. Our in vitro study on trout myocytes indicated that IGF1 induces FoxO3 phosphorylation but has a low or no effect on autophagy-related gene expression, suggesting a moderate role for this transcription factor on the autophagic/lysosomal pathway in this species. Data reported here show for the first time in a lower vertebrate, the existence and the regulation of several major genes involved in the autophagy, opening a new area of research on the molecular bases of muscle protein degradation in teleosts."
0,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) are a group of signaling molecules known to play important roles during formation and maintenance of various organs, not only bone, but also muscle, blood and so on. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is one of the most intensively studied fish due to its economic and environmental importance. Besides, common carp has encountered an additional round of whole genome duplication (WGD) compared with many closely related diploid teleost, which make it one of the most important models for genome evolutionary studies in teleost. Comprehensive genome resources of common carp have been developed recently, which facilitate the thorough characterization of bmp gene family in the tetraploidized common carp genome. We identified a total of 44 bmps from the common carp genome, which are twice as many as that of zebrafish. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of bmps are highly conserved. Comparative analysis was performed across six typical vertebrate genomes. It appeared that all the bmp genes in common carp were duplicated. Obviously, the expansion of the bmp gene family in common carp was due to the latest additional round of whole genome duplication and made it more abundant than other diploid teleosts. Expression signatures were assessed in major tissues, including gill, intestine, liver, spleen, skin, heart, gonad, muscle, kidney, head kidney, brain and blood, which demonstrated the comprehensive expression profiles of bmp genes in the tetraploidized genome. Significant gene expression divergences were observed which revealed substantial functional divergences of those duplicated bmp genes post the latest WGD event. The conserved synteny blocks of bmp5s revealed the genome rearrangement of common carp post the 4R WGD. The whole set of bmp gene family in common carp provides insight into gene fate of tetraploidized common carp genome post recent WGD."
0,"Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is known to be involved in antiviral response as well as regulation of functional and developmental processes in lymphomyeloid cell lineages in mammals. In this study, the gene of IRF4a and its two transcript variants (named IRF4a1 and -2) were cloned from turbot, Scophthalmus maximus, the tissue distributions and in vivo immune responsive expression patterns of the two transcripts were subsequently examined. The Scophthalmus maximus (Sm)IRF4a gene is 8367 nucleotide (nt) in length, consisting of eight exons and seven introns. The SmIRF4a1 transcript is 3185 nt long, containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1401 nt that encodes a polypeptide of 466 amino acids (aa). The SmIRF4a2 transcript is 2265 nt long and identical with the SmIRF4a1 from position 1 to 1171, containing an ORF of 1164 nt that encodes a truncated protein of 387 aa as a result of a frame shift in exon 6 which introduces a premature stop codon. The deduced aa sequence of SmIRF4a1 posses a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a serine-rich domain (SRD) and an IRF association domain (IAD), while SmIRF4a2 lacks the C-terminal 52 residues of the IAD and the downstream C-terminal extension, instead, they are replaced by a 8-aa segment although the three upstream domains are intact. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed a broad tissue expression for both SmIRF4a1 and -2 with the former showing a significantly higher expression in all examined tissues except skin. Expressions of two transcript variants after stimulation with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] and turbot reddish body iridovirus (TRBIV) were tested in gills, spleen, head kidney and muscle. A two-wave of induced expression pattern was observed for both transcripts with either stimulus treatment during a 7-day time course. SmIRF4a2 responded more promptly to the stimuli and showed a higher level of inducibility in the early phase while SmIRF4a1 was strongly detected in the later phase. These data suggest an important role of SmIRF4a2 in the fast immune response under a background of SmIRF4a1-dominant antiviral response in the IRF4a system of turbot."
0,"Giant groupers (Epinephelus lanceolatus), an important aquaculture fish in Asia, are attacked by nervous necrosis virus (NNV), belonging to betanodavirus. Environmental salinity can affect fish immunity and physiology. We examined whether decreasing salinity from 30 to 15 ppt during acclimation of groupers could affect survival with NNV infection and the associated factors. Although NNV infection decreased muscle moisture, up-regulated the gene expression of Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter isoform 2, and elevated plasma cortisol level in groupers, these factors were not related to the higher mortality of groupers reared at 30-ppt salinity (S30-groupers), compared to 15-ppt reared groupers (S15-groupers). Infected S30-groupers exhibited high leukocyte count and innate immune gene expression level. Moreover, NNV-infected dead S30-groupers showed high IL-1β gene expression level but low NNV load in the brain. The high or excess IL-1β gene expression levels in the brain of NNV-infected S30-groupers may be the factor in high mortality. "
0,"Failure to properly repair damaged due to myocardial infarction is a major cause of heart failure. In contrast with adult mammals, zebrafish hearts show remarkable regenerative capabilities after substantial damage. To characterize protein dynamics during heart regeneration, we employed an HPLC-ESI-MS/MS (mass spectrometry) approach. Myocardium tissues were taken from sham-operated fish and ventricle-resected sample at three different time points (2, 7, and 14 days); dynamics of protein expression were analyzed by an ion-current-based quantitative platform. More than 2000 protein groups were quantified in all 16 experiments. Two hundred and nine heart-regeneration-related protein groups were quantified and clustered into six time-course patterns. Functional analysis indicated that multiple molecular function and metabolic pathways were involved in heart regeneration. Interestingly, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that P53 signaling was inhibited during the heart regeneration, which was further verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). In summary, we applied systematic proteomics analysis on regenerating zebrafish heart, uncovered the dynamics of regenerative genes expression and regulatory pathways, and provided invaluable insight into design regenerative-based strategies in human hearts."
0,"The Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) is a flatfish with distinctive asymmetry in its body coloration. The melanism (hyperpigmentation) in both the blind side and ocular side of C. semilaevis gives it an extremely low commercial value. However, the fundamental molecular mechanism of this melanism remains unclear. Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a GTP-binding protein-coupled receptor, is considered to play a vital role in the physiology of the vertebrate pigment system. In order to confirm the contribution of MC1R to the body coloration of C. semilaevis, the expression levels of Mc1r mRNA were measured in seven tissue types at different developmental stages of normal and melanistic C. semilaevis. The expression levels of Mc1r mRNA in the heart, brain, liver, kidney, ocular-side skin, and blind-side skin of melanistic C. semilaevis were significantly higher than that of normal C. semilaevis in all developmental stages. Moreover, the knocking down of Mc1r in the C. semilaevis liver cell line (HTLC) increased the expression of the downstream genes microphthalmia transcription factor (Mitf) and tyrosinase-related protein 1 (Tyrp1) in the pigmentation pathway. Thus, the present data suggest that MC1R might play important roles in Tyrp1- and Mitf-mediated pigment synthesis in C. semilaevis."
0,"In order to examine the effects of seasonal acclimation on mitochondrial metabolic functions and test tissue-specific pattern of the metabolic compensation within individuals of the southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis Chen), rates of mitochondrial respiration and activities of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in the heart, liver, kidney, brain and white muscle of this fish in the summer-acclimatized group (153.20±1.66 g) and winter-acclimatized group (177.71±3.04 g) were measured at seven assay temperatures (7.5, 12.5, 17.5, 22.5, 27.5, 32.5 and 37.5°C), respectively. The results show that compensatory adjustments in state III respiratory rate and COX activity occur significantly in the heart, kidney and liver, but do not in the brain and white muscle, which suggest that the metabolic compensation of this fish in response to seasonal acclimation exhibits a tissue-specific pattern. The cold acclimation increases mitochondrial oxidative capacities in the heart, kidney and liver concomitantly with reducing their upper thermal limits of mitochondrial functions at acute warming and the thermal tolerance shifts in the same tissue-specific pattern as the metabolic compensation. When combining the effects of seasonal acclimation on mitochondrial oxidative capacity and organ mass, the metabolic compensation demonstrates an organ-specific pattern with four categories: over-compensation in the heart, complete compensation in the kidney, partial compensation in the liver and no compensation in the brain. The organ-specific pattern of metabolic compensation might be a trade-off strategy of the performance adjustments in the seasonal acclimation for this fish to maximize its fitness."
0,"Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) has important roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses. This cytokine plays a very important role in defining Th1 immune response in all vertebrates. In the present study, we identified and isolated for the first time the gene coding for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) IFNγ from spleen lymphocytes. The isolated tilapia IFNγ has between 24 and 62% of amino acid identity as compared to reported sequences for other teleost fishes. It has close phylogenetic relationships with IFNγ molecules belonging to the group of Perciforms and presents the typical structural characteristics of gamma interferon molecules. The tissue expression analysis showed that IFNγ is expressed constitutively in head kidney, skin, intestine, muscle and brain. Its expression was not detected in gills by conventional RT-PCR. However, under conditions of stimulation with Poly I:C and LPS, IFNγ expression was up-regulated in gills after 24 h post-stimulation. IFNγ expression was also induced in gills 24 h after Edwardsiella tarda infection suggesting its important role in immunity against intracellular bacteria. The recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli induced Mx gene transcription in head kidney primary culture cells. These results are the first steps to characterize the role of tilapia IFNγ in the defense against pathogens in tilapia. Furthermore, the isolation of this molecule provides a new tool to characterize the cellular immune response to various stimuli in this organism."
0,"The wide applicability of silver nanoparticles in medicine and pharmaceutical industries leads to its over exploitation and thus contaminating our environment. Majority of these nanoscale dimension particles finally accumulates in fresh water and marine ecosystem. As the nanoparticles behave entirely different from its corresponding bulk material, a better understanding of their environmental impacts in aquatic ecosystems is inevitable. The study was focused on a comparative stress physiology analysis of chemically synthesized silver nanoparticles and biogenic silver nanoparticles. Half maximal inhibitory concentration of biologically synthesized and chemically synthesized nanoparticles was found out (30μg/mL and 20μg/mL respectively). The Heat Shock Protein (HSP70) secretion was analysed in the fresh water fish Oreochromis niloticus after exposing to different concentrations of biologically and chemically synthesized silver nanoparticles along with the silver in its ionic form. The intense immune-histochemical staining of fish tissues (muscle, kidney and liver) analyzed proportionately reflected the stress created. The colour intensity was directly proportional to the stress created or the stress protein released. High level of HSP70 expression was observed in all of the fish tissues exposed to silver ions and chemically synthesized silver nanoparticles, when compared to that of biologically synthesized. The results revealed the significance of comparatively safe and less toxic biogenic nanoparticles compared to the chemically synthesized."
0,"Green fluorescent protein (GFP) from eel (Anguilla japonica) muscle (eelGFP) is unique in the vertebrates and requires bilirubin as a ligand to emit fluorescence. This study was performed to clarify the physiological function of the unique GFP. Investigation of susceptibility to oxidative stress was carried out using three types of cell lines including jellyfish (Aequorea coerulescens) GFP (jfGFP)-, or eel GFP (eelGFP)-expressing HEK293 cells, and control vector-transfected HEK293 cells. Binding of eelGFP to bilirubin was confirmed by the observation of green fluorescence in HEK293-eelGFP cells. The growth rate was compared with the three types of cells in the presence or absence of phenol red which possessed antioxidant activity. The growth rates of HEK293-CV and HEK293-jfGFP under phenol red-free conditions were reduced to 52 and 31% of those under phenol red. Under the phenol red-free condition, HEK293-eelGFP had a growth rate of approximately 70% of the phenol red-containing condition. The eelGFP-expressing cells were approximately 2-fold resistant to oxidative stress such as H2O2 exposure. The fluorescence intensity partially decreased or disappeared after exposure to H2O2, and heterogeneous intensity of fluorescence was also observed in isolated eel skeletal muscle cells. These results suggested eelGFP, but not jfGFP, coupled with bilirubin provided the antioxidant activity to the cells as compared to non-bound free bilirubin. "
0,"Fish proteins are highly susceptible to changes during frozen storage, leading to modifications in protein solubility, functionality, and structure, which affect the rheological properties, which, in turn, contribute to changes in techno-functional properties. Under frozen storage, these changes are the result of many physical and chemical modifications, especially structural and functional protein changes. The aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify protein and textural changes during frozen storage of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fillets at four temperatures (268 K, 264 K, 260 K and 255 K). The Weibullian model was applied in order to understand the quality changes. Results for all frozen storage temperatures showed that total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) did not reach the regulated limits (30-35 mg/100 g muscle), salt-soluble protein (SSP) decreased systematically and total nitrogen (TN) was constant. Hardness, adhesiveness, gumminess and chewiness levels decreased systematically at all temperatures, but cohesiveness and springiness values were relatively constant over time, at the same given temperature. A comparison between different temperatures showed an increase in the measurements observed. A kinetic analysis for TVBN, SSP, hardness, adhesiveness and chewiness, was performed. All quality indicators, except TVBN, showed reaction rates inversely proportional to the temperature, and fractional shape factors or orders of reaction. Using the Weibullian model, this study demonstrates that, in complex biological processes, quality indicators do not have an integer kinetic order and reaction rates are strongly temperature-dependent. Thus, this kind of model can be used to improve understanding, prediction, and control of the frozen storage process."
0,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the toxic effects of Cr<sup>6+</sup> on bioaccumulation, digestion, immunity, oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation-related genes in Channa asiatica. The fish was exposed to waterborne Cr<sup>6+</sup> concentrations (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/L) for 28 and 56 days. Our results demonstrated that the accumulation of Cr<sup>6+</sup> in tissues increased in a concentration-dependent manner, and the content in tissue was liver > gill > gut > muscle. Meanwhile, Cr<sup>6+</sup> exposure led to a remarkable suppression of digestion, immunity and antioxidant capacity in C. asiatica. Inversely, MDA and PC content were positively correlated with Cr<sup>6+</sup> exposure concentration. Furthermore, the expression of genes went up with the increase of waterborne Cr<sup>6+</sup> concentration. Among them, HSP90, NF-κB and TNF-α have a sharp increase. These results elucidate that waterborne Cr<sup>6+</sup> exposure may induce bioaccumulation, inhibit digestion and immunity, promote oxidative stress and up-regulate the expression of apoptosis and inflammation-related genes in C. asiatica."
0,"Calsequestrins (CSQ) are high capacity, medium affinity, calcium-binding proteins present in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of cardiac and skeletal muscles. CSQ sequesters Ca²⁺ during muscle relaxation and increases the Ca²⁺-storage capacity of the SR. Mammalian CSQ has been well studied as a model of human disease, but little is known about the environmental adaptation of CSQ isoforms from poikilothermic organisms. The mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus, is an intertidal fish that experiences significant daily and seasonal environmental fluctuations and is an interesting study system for investigations of adaptation at the protein level. We determined the full-length coding sequence of a CSQ isoform from skeletal muscle of F. heteroclitus (FCSQ) and characterized the function and structure of this CSQ. The dissociation constant (K(d)) of FCSQ is relatively insensitive to changes in temperature and pH, thus indicating that FCSQ is a eurytolerant protein. We identified and characterized a highly conserved salt bridge network in FCSQ that stabilizes the formation of front-to-front dimers, a process critical to CSQ function. The functional profile of FCSQ correlates with the natural history of F. heteroclitus suggesting that the eurytolerant function of FCSQ may be adaptive."
0,"The exact mechanisms of the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular events are not yet fully understood; however, oxidative stress may be involved. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of resveratrol and fish oil on catecholamine-induced mortality in obese rats. To begin with, rats were divided into five groups: (1) lean, (2) obese, (3) obese supplemented with resveratrol, (4) obese supplemented with fish oil and (5) obese supplemented with resveratrol and fish oil (n 18 rats per group), for 2 months. After supplementation, the groups were subdivided as with (n 10) and without (n 8) cardiovascular catecholaminergic stress after isoproterenol (60 mg/kg) injection. At 24 h later, the survival rate was analysed. The obese group showed lower survival rates (10 %) when compared with the lean group (70 %). On the other hand, resveratrol (50 %) and fish oil (40 %) increased the survival rate of obese rats (χ(2) test, P= 0·019). Biochemical analyses of the myocardium and aorta revealed that obese rats had higher levels of superoxide and oxidative damage to lipids and protein. This was associated with reduced superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity in both the myocardium and aorta. The supplementation increased antioxidant enzyme activities and reduced oxidative damage. We also evaluated the nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 antioxidant pathway. Nrf2 protein levels that were reduced in obese rats were increased by the antioxidant treatment. Taken together, these results showed that resveratrol and fish oil reduce catecholamine-induced mortality in obese rats, partly through the reduction of oxidative stress."
0,"Extraskeletal osteosarcoma is a rare neoplasia within the broad differential diagnostic spectrum of calcifying intramuscular lesions. We present a case of a slowly increasing mass within the left vastus lateralis muscle. At first presentation the patient showed a partially calcified well defined mass with a diameter of 5 cm and with no direct contact to the femur. A biopsy from the periphery revealed an ossifying lesion compatible with myositis ossificans. The patient returned 18 months later with the lesion having increased to a diameter of 25 cm. The resection specimen revealed a well delimitated tumor with a central core of partially necrotic neoplastic bone. Besides, histology showed high mitotic areas with pleomorphic spindle cells and regions with cartilaginous differentiation. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated: vimentin+, CD34-, desmin-, actin-, EMA- and pancytokeratin- with focal S100 protein positivity and a Ki-67 index of 20%. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed a gain of chromosomal material on 12q; FISH analyses for the CDK4 and MDM2 region showed high level amplifications. Consequently, a high-grade dedifferentiated extraskeletal osteosarcoma was diagnosed. In conclusion, analysis of the MDM2 and CDK4 status is a powerful and discriminating diagnostic tool to distinguish dedifferentiated extraskeletal osteosarcoma from other benign/malignant ossifying lesions in the skeletal muscle."
0,"Ionic regulation is essential for the metabolism and cellular function. For many physiological processes, ionic calcium (Ca(+2)) is important for example muscle contractions, nerve signaling, membrane permeability, cell division and hormone release. In nerve cells, the excess intracellular concentration of Ca(+2) causes cell death. It has been shown that certain calcium binding proteins (CaBPs) are essential for Ca(+2) homeostasis and protect neurons from excess Ca(+2) influx. We are for the first time showing an unusual calretinin (CR) expression and significant differences in its occurrence in the forebrain of the cichlid fish (Cynotilapia sp.) compared to other teleosts. CR labeled neurons were seen in the dorsal and lateral part of the dorsal telencephalic area, entopeduncular nucleus (EN), nucleus preopticus (NPO), diffuse nucleus of lateral torus (NDTL), ventral hypothalamic nucleus (VH), preglomerular nucleus (NPG) and optic tectum. Surprisingly, large numbers of CR immunoreactive perikarya were noted in the optic chiasma (Oc). These neurons were oval with elongated processes and forming a huge fiber network in the Oc. Enormously CR stained fibers were seen in the lateral and medial olfactory tract. Widespread distributions of strongly CR labeled fibers were observed around the EN projecting dorsally into the telencephalon, Oc and optic nerve. Presence of CR in the NPO suggests that it may be involved in the hormonal regulation by the pituitary. As in vertebrates EN plays an important role in sensory functions, massive localization CR in the EN may suggests role of CR in sensory functions of the cichlid fish. "
0,"Tilapia piscidin 3 (TP3) and tilapia piscidin 4 (TP4) are antimicrobial peptides recently isolated from Oreochromis niloticus. We previously showed that synthetic TP3 and TP4 possessed antimicrobial activities. Here, we analyzed the bactericidal abilities and immunomodulatory properties of these AMPs following the electroporation of pCMV-GFP-TP3 or pCMV-GFP-TP4 plasmid into tilapia (O. niloticus) muscle and subsequent infection with Vibrio vulnificus or Streptococcus agalactiae. Prior overexpression of TP3 or TP4 in tilapia muscle tissues efficiently reduced bacterial numbers at 24 and 48 h after V. vulnificus infection and reduced bacterial numbers at 24 h after S. agalactiae infection compared to numbers in controls expressing pCMV-GFP (EGFP). Electroporation of pCMV-EGFP-TP3 (TP3) or pCMV-EGFP-TP4 (TP4) significantly increased expression of several immune-related genes in muscle (IL-1β (12 h, TP3), IL-8 (12 h, TP3), TGFβ (3 h, TP4), and IκB (48 h, TP3, TP4)) and decreased the expression of TLR5 (12 h and 24 h, TP3) after V. vulnificus infection. Following S. agalactiae infection, expression of the following genes was significantly decreased in muscle: IL-1β (12 h, TP3), IL-8 (12 h, TP3, TP4), TLR5 (3 h-24 h, TP3, TP4), TGFβ (3 h, TP4; 24 h, TP3, TP4), and IκB (3 h, TP3). These data suggest that TP3 and TP4 exert antimicrobial effects after overexpression in the O. niloticus muscle, and also play important roles in the regulation of immune-related gene expression."
0,"High levels of dietary lipids are incorporated in feeds for most teleost fish to promote growth and reduce nitrogen waste. However, in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) previous studies revealed that increasing the level of dietary lipids above 8% negatively affect growth and nutrient utilization regardless of dietary protein content. It has been shown that glucose regulation and metabolism can be impaired by high dietary fat intake in mammals, but information in teleost fish is scarce. The aim of this study was to assess the possible effect of dietary lipids on glucose metabolism in Senegalese sole with special emphasis on the regulation of proteins involved in the muscle insulin-signalling pathway. Senegalese sole juveniles (29 g) were fed two isonitrogenous diets (53% dry matter) for 88 days. These two diets were one with a high lipid level (∼17%, HL) and a moderate starch content (∼14%, LC), and the other being devoid of fish oil (4% lipid, LL) and with high starch content (∼23%, HC). Surprisingly, feeding Senegalese sole the HL/LC diet resulted in prolonged hyperglycaemia, while fish fed on LL/HC diet restored basal glycaemia 2 h after feeding. The hyperglycaemic phenotype was associated with greater glucose-6-phosphatase activity (a key enzyme of hepatic glucose production) and lower citrate synthase activity in the liver, with significantly higher liver glycogen content. Sole fed on HL/LC diet also had significantly lower hexokinase activity in muscle, although hexokinase activity was low with both dietary treatments. The HL/LC diet was associated with significant reductions in muscle AKT, p70 ribosomal S6-K1 Kinase (S6K-1) and ribosomal protein S6 (S6) 2 h after feeding, suggesting down regulation of the AKT-mTOR nutrient signalling pathway in these fish. The results of this study show for the first time that high level of dietary lipids strongly affects glucose metabolism in Senegalese sole. "
0,"A 90-day randomized feeding experiment was performed to assess the effects of dietary cobalt (Co) supplementation on the growth performance, muscle composition, status of iron and manganese in the muscle as well as the expression of growth-related genes in the muscle (myoblast determination protein 1 homolog (MyoD) and myogenin) and the stress-related gene heat shock protein 70 KDa (Hsp-70) in the liver of mahseer (Tor putitora). Feeding trial was conducted in triplicate under controlled semi-static conditions, and graded levels of dietary cobalt (0.5-3 mg/kg) were fed to six groups of advanced fry of T. putitora. The results obtained indicated a curvilinear relationship of dietary Co levels with body crude protein content and weight gain (%). A positive correlation was observed with up to 2 mg Co/kg diet. However, a decreasing trend was found with values over 2 mg Co/kg diet. The expression of muscle growth biomarkers MyoD and myogenin showed a similar response, upregulation up to 2 mg Co/kg diet and decreased expression at 3 mg Co/kg diet. Indeed, the highest dietary Co supplementation increased the expression of Hsp-70, a key gene expressed in response to stress. Moreover, the muscle content of iron and manganese showed an inverse relationship with the dietary Co supplementation. Our findings suggest that 2 mg/kg Co dietary supplementation stimulates myogenesis and optimize muscle growth and body composition, while higher levels enhanced the expression of stress response genes and impaired growth of T. putitora."
0,"The canned-sardine industry generates large amounts of protein-rich waste, which demands useful exploitation. This paper describes the potential use of muscle and viscera proteins from canned sardine by-products as substrate to obtain hydrolysates with biological and functional properties. Three enzymatic approaches, brewer's spent yeast (Bsy) proteases, Alcalase® and Neutrase® were applied to perform protein hydrolysis at the same proteolytic activity (1 U mL<sup>-1</sup> ), using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 20% (v/v), at 50°C and for 7 h. Hydrolysis degree (DH), antioxidant and angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACE-I) activities, functional properties (i.e. solubility, emulsifying and foaming properties, water and oil binding capacity) and colour were investigated."
1,"All hydrolysates presented a high protein content [52.7-83.2% dry weight (DW)] and low fat content (0.9-3.9% DW). Alcalase® treatment of muscle and viscera proteins resulted in higher DH (7.5% and 8.6%, respectively) and higher biological activities (P < 0.05). All hydrolysates had excellent solubility and presented functional properties. Among viscera hydrolysates, treatment with Bsy proteases promoted higher emulsion (80.1 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> ), foaming (79.2%) and oil binding capacity (5.8 g g<sup>-1</sup> ) of viscera sardine proteins."

Information on the toxicity of estrogens to native species in that can be used in site-specific risk assessments is scarce. In the present study, one zona pellucida 3 (ZP3) homologue termed CaZP3 was firstly identified from topmouth culter Culter alburnus, following its structural characteristics, tissue distribution and transcriptional modulation to 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) exposure were investigated. Meanwhile, vitellogenin (VTG) gene was employed to provide a comparison of the reactive ability to EE2 induction. The CaZP3 characterized with analogical functional domains such as ZP domain, SP, IHP, EHP, 12 cysteine residues, one N-linked glycosylation site and two conserved O-linked glycosylation sites and equal number of eight exons and seven introns with ZP3 counterparts of higher species. CaZP3 mRNA predominantly expressed in ovary, besides, highly expressed in female heart and male muscle and relatively high expressed in testis. CaZP3 has the lower reactive ability to EE2 induction in comparison with VTG, however, CaZP3 transcripts were significantly induced in gonads of both male and female culter by EE2 and could be used as an alternative biomarker to monitor EE2 activity. The present results supplement the database for toxicity of EE2, especially for fish species endemic to China and provide some useful information for the monitoring of EE2 activity in aquatic environment."
0,"Acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are members of a superfamily of proteins called pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, which are found in almost all forms of life and thus have a rich evolutionary history. Muscle-type AChRs are heteropentameric complexes assembled from four related subunits (α, β, δ, and ɛ). Here we reconstruct the amino acid sequence of a β subunit ancestor shared by humans and cartilaginous fishes (i.e., Torpedo). Then, by resurrecting this ancestral β subunit and co-expressing it with human α, δ, and ɛ subunits, we show that despite 132 substitutions, the ancestral subunit is capable of forming human/ancestral hybrid AChRs. Whole-cell currents demonstrate that the agonist acetylcholine has reduced potency for hybrid receptors, while single-channel recordings reveal that hybrid receptors display reduced conductance and open probability. Our results outline a promising strategy for studies of AChR evolution aimed at identifying the amino acid origins of AChR structure and function."
0,"The ability of different in vitro antioxidant assays to predict the efficiency of cod protein hydrolysate (CPH) and Fucus vesiculosus ethyl acetate extract (EA) towards lipid oxidation in haemoglobin-fortified washed cod mince and iron-containing cod liver oil emulsion was evaluated. The progression of oxidation was followed by sensory analysis, lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in both systems, as well as loss of redness and protein carbonyls in the cod system."
1,"The in vitro tests revealed high reducing capacity, high DPPH radical scavenging properties and a high oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) value of the EA which also inhibited lipid and protein oxidation in the cod model system. The CPH had a high metal chelating capacity and was efficient against oxidation in the cod liver oil emulsion."
2,"The results indicate that the F. vesiculosus extract has a potential as an excellent natural antioxidant against lipid oxidation in fish muscle foods while protein hydrolysates are more promising for fish oil emulsions. The usefulness of in vitro assays to predict the antioxidative properties of new natural ingredients in foods thus depends on the knowledge about the food systems, particularly the main pro-oxidants present."
0,"The effects of tryptophan (Trp) and phenylalanine (Phe) diet supplementation on the stress and metabolism of the Atlantic cod have been studied. Fish were fed diet supplemented with Trp or Phe or control diet for 1 week. At the end of the feeding trial, fish were subjected to air exposure or heat shock. Following samples of blood, liver and muscle were taken from the fish and were analyzed for stress and metabolic indicators. After an air exposure, plasma cortisol levels in fish fed with Trp and Phe diets were lower compared to the fish fed the control diet. Diets containing both amino acids increased significantly the liver transaminase activities in juvenile cod. During thermal stress, high Trp contents had significant effects on fructose biphosphatase activity though Phe did not. Overall, activities of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and phosphofructokinase increased significantly for both amino acid diets. For the thermal stress, fish had the highest values of those activities for the 3Trp diet. Trp content in the diet had significant effects on the transaminase activity in muscle during air stress compared to fish fed control and Phe diets. Muscle alanine transaminase activity for thermal stress in fish fed any diet was not significantly different from the control. Both Trp and Phe supplementations reduced the stress markers in the cod; hence, they could be used as additives for the stress attenuation. However, they also raised the activity of key enzymes in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, mainly the Trp diets."
0,"Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction is the most advanced method of quantifying gene expression studies; however, the significance of the obtained results strongly depends on the normalization of the data to compensate for differences between the samples. In the present study, expression analysis of six different constitutively expressed genes viz. 18S ribosomal RNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), beta actin (βactin), ribosomal binding protein L13, tubulin and TATA-box-binding protein (tbp) were carried out to test their efficacy as reference genes in three different tissues, namely liver, gill and muscle of murrel Channa striatus exposed to high temperature for variable time periods. The stability and suitability of the genes were determined by using bioinformatic tools: GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. Based on the results, tub/βactin could be used as the reference genes for liver and gill tissues and βactin/gapdh could be the reference genes for muscle tissues in Channa striatus under both short- and long-term thermal stress.

0,"Follistatin is a secreted glycoprotein, which involved in numerous physiological activities as an antagonist of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily. However, little is known about the regulation mechanism of follistatin in fish. In this study we cloned and analyzed part of the 5' flanking region of the follistatin gene in Larimichthys crocea. Sequence analysis revealed several putative binding sites for transcription factors including activator protein 1 (AP1), myogenic differentiation factor (MyoD), stimulating protein 1 (SP1), and sex determining gene on the mammalian Y chromosome (SRY) in the cloned fragment. Transcriptional activities of two fragments (485 and 261 bp) truncated from follistatin upstream region were examined in vitro, using transient transfection in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) and Rattus norvegicus skeletal muscle myoblast (L6) cells. The result showed that the promoter activity correlated positively with the length of truncated fragments in both CIK and L6 cells. To study the regulation of follistatin expression in L. crocea, we cloned MyoD and SRY-box 8 (Sox8) genes and examined their action on the follistatin promoter by co-transfection in CIK and L6 cells. The results showed MyoD and Sox8 could suppress the activities of follistatin promoter at different levels in CIK and L6 cells. "
0,"As one economically important fish in the southeastern Himalayas, the giant devil catfish (Bagarius yarrelli) has been known for its extraordinarily large body size. It can grow up to 2 m, whereas the non-Bagarius sisorids only reach 10-30 cm. Another outstanding characteristic of Bagarius species is the salmonids-like reddish flesh color. Both body size and flesh color are interesting questions in science and also valuable features in aquaculture that worth of deep investigations. Bagarius species therefore are ideal materials for studying body size evolution and color depositions in fish muscles, and also potential organisms for extensive utilization in Asian freshwater aquaculture. In a combination of Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies, we de novo assembled a 571-Mb genome for the giant devil catfish from a total of 153.4-Gb clean reads. The scaffold and contig N50 values are 3.1 and 1.6 Mb, respectively. This genome assembly was evaluated with 93.4% of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs completeness, 98% of transcripts coverage, and highly homologous with a chromosome-level-based genome of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). We detected that 35.26% of the genome assembly is composed of repetitive elements. Employing homology, de novo, and transcriptome-based annotations, we annotated a total of 19,027 protein-coding genes for further use. In summary, we generated the first high-quality genome assembly of the giant devil catfish, which provides an important genomic resource for its future studies such as the body size and flesh color issues, and also for facilitating the conservation and utilization of this valuable catfish."
0,"Nutritional Programming (NP) has been studied as a means of improving dietary plant protein (PP) utilization in different fish species. This study investigated the use of enriched live feed as a vehicle for NP in larval fish. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of NP induced during the larval stage via PP-enriched live feed on: (1) growth performance; (2) expression of genes associated with inflammation and any morphological changes in the intestine; and (3) muscle free amino acid composition in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) during its later life stages. Two diets were used in this study, a fish meal (FM)-based diet, and a soybean mean (SBM)-based diet, serving as the PP diet. There were 4 groups in this study. The two control groups, ( +) Control and (-) Control, were not programmed and received the FM-diet and SBM-diet, respectively throughout the whole trial after the live feed stage (27-122 days post hatch (dph). The next group, programmed, was programmed with SBM-enriched Artemia nauplii during the live feed stage (4-26 dph) and challenged with the SBM-diet during the final stage of the study (79-122 dph). The final group, non-programmed, did not receive any programming and, was challenged with the SBM-diet during the final stage of the study. The programmed group experienced a significantly higher (%) weight gain during the PP-Challenge than the non-programmed group. In addition, the live feed programming resulted in significantly longer distal villi, and a higher villi length to width ratio, compared to the non-programmed group. No significant effects on free amino acid composition and gene expression were observed between the programmed and non-programmed group, except for an increased post-prandial concentration of free proline in the programmed group. The results of this study support use of live feed as a vehicle for nutritional programming and improving the growth performance of largemouth bass fed with a SBM-based diet."
0,"Biochemical and protein conformational changes in silver carp occurred during ice storage, affecting the physico-chemical and textural properties of its washed mince. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and FT Raman could offer insightful molecular-level information that could be related to the freshness of fish and textural properties of washed mince."
1,"The K value increased from 15.8% to 85.0% after 14 days on ice. The surface hydrophobicity of silver carp muscle proteins increased during ice storage, and its thrice-washed mince showed the same trend. The yield and textural properties of washed mince continually decreased as the storage time was extended. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that, as storage time increased, the α-helix content of mince decreased, while the β sheet content increased. Prolonged ice storage led to the exposure of buried aromatic amino acid residues and an increase in disulfide interchanges in mince and washed mince. Changes in the ∑β sheet structure and Raman intensity at 828 cm<sup>-1</sup> observed in mince correlated well with the K value. The α-helix content and Raman intensity of raw washed mince at 621 and 828 cm<sup>-1</sup> showed a strong correlation with its textural properties."
2,Silver carp should be processed to surimi within 7 days of ice storage to obtain a reasonably good yield and gel texture. Infrared and Raman spectroscopy can possibly be utilized to monitor freshness quality and protein conformational changes in silver carp and to estimate the textural properties of washed mince as affected by freshness. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.
0,"Ribosomal biogenesis controls cellular growth in living organisms, with the rate-limiting step of this process being the transcription of ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Considering that epigenetic mechanisms allow an organism to respond to environmental changes, the expression in muscle of several molecules that regulate epigenetic rRNA synthesis, as well as rDNA transcription, were evaluated during the seasonal acclimatization of the carp. First, the nucleotide sequences encoding the components forming the NoRC (ttf-I, tip5) and eNoSC (sirt1, nml, suv39h1), two chromatin remodeling complexes that silence rRNA synthesis, as well as the sequence of ubf1, a key regulator of rDNA transcription, were obtained. Subsequently the transcriptional regulation of the aforementioned molecules, and other key molecules involved in rRNA synthesis (mh2a1, mh2a2, h2a.z, h2a.z.7, nuc, p80), was assessed. The carp sequences for TTF-I, TIP5, SIRT1, NML, SUV39H1, and UBF1 showed a high conservation of domains and key amino acids in comparison with other fish and higher vertebrates. The mRNA contents in muscle for ttf-I, tip5, sirt1, nml, suv39h1, mh2a1, mh2a.z, and nuc were up-regulated during winter in comparison with summer, whereas the mRNA levels of mh2a2, ubf1, and p80 were down-regulated. Also, the contents of molecules involved in processing the rRNA (snoRNAs) and pRNA, a stabilizer of NoRC complex, were analyzed, finding that these non-coding RNAs were not affected by seasonal acclimatization. These results suggest that variations in the expression of rRNA and the molecules that epigenetically regulate its synthesis are contributing to the muscle plasticity induced by seasonal acclimatization in carp.

0,"The structure of myofibrillar protein (MP) can be readily altered by oxidation, leading to the unfolding of MP structure, which further promotes protein-protein interactions, and thus influences the MP gelling properties. The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of malondialdehyde-induced oxidative stress on the gelation properties of myofibrillar protein (MP). Structural changes of the oxidised MPs were evaluated by the contents of carbonyl and total sulfhydryls, surface hydrophobicity, SDS-PAGE and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The oxidative stability of the MP gels as indicated by lipid hydroperoxide was also determined."
1,"With the addition of an MDA concentration less than 10 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> , the MP gels showed an improved elasticity, gel strength, water holding capacity, and oxidative stability. Nevertheless, higher MDA concentration (25-50 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> ) significantly reduced the gel quality, probably due to the formation of excessive covalent bonds in the system."

0,"Myostatin (mstn) is an important member of TGF-β superfamily, a muscle growth inhibitor. Though mstn has been identified in many organisms, little is known about this gene in highland fish, Gymnocypris przewalskii endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we first cloned two paralogous mstn genes (mstn1 and mstn2) from G. przewalskii through homologue cloning. The 3D structures of both Mstn proteins varied in the numbers of β-sheets and conformations of α-helices. The branch-site model showed that mstn1 has undergone positive selection, and two positively selected sites (107M and 181T) were located on the random coils of the 3D protein structure. Expression patterns indicated that the mstn1 expressed widely, while the mstn2 only expressed in the muscle and brain. During the early stage of embryo development, the expression levels of both mstn paralogous genes showed different increasing trends. These results suggest that it is diverging in two mstn paralogues of G. przewalskii via specific differences in gene structure, protein structure, selection pressure and gene expression patterns. Taken together, this study provides novel contribution on the research topics of growth related gene function and mechanism of highland fish in extreme aquatic environment on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

0,Oxidation of myoglobin is responsible for the undesirable appearance and loss in acceptability of fish and fish products. The retardation of such a change by a modification of the surrounding atmosphere would be a means to maintain the quality of fish during the refrigerated storage.
1,"The changes in oxymyoglobin and metmyoglobin from dark muscle of Eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis) as affected by different atmospheric systems (closed system, opened system and flushed oxygen system) were determined. A saturated oxygen atmosphere more likely weakened the haem-globin complex, especially as the exposure time increased. Autoxidation of the oxy form proceeded rapidly in the presence of oxygen with the concomitant formation of the met form. When the oxygen was excluded, oxidation of oxymyoglobin was retarded. With flushed oxygen and increasing exposure time, conformational changes of globin occurred, mainly associated with protein oxidation. Generally, oxymyoglobin was more susceptible to oxidation and conformational change than did metmyoglobin. After keeping the samples at 4 °C for 3 days, dark muscle of tuna fillet kept in vacuum packaging had a slight decrease in redness and it was still acceptable. The fillets stored in exposed air or packed in 100% O(2) atmosphere turned brown, most likely due to myoglobin oxidation."

0,"Bacterial infections represent serious diseases in aquaculture, rapidly leading to fish death by septicemia. We investigated whether the electrotransfer of green fluorescent protein gene fusion epinecidin-1 (CMV-gfp-epi) DNA into zebrafish muscle could regulate the fish immune response and inhibit bacterial growth. Electroporation parameters such as the number of pulses, voltage, and amount of plasmid DNA were analyzed, and results demonstrated the greatest mRNA expression level of gfp-epi relative to beta-actin was obtained with a pulse number of 4, a voltage strength of 100 V/cm, a concentration of DNA of 90 microg/fish, and electroporation for 96 h. In addition, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter exhibited higher activity compared to the mylz promoter in muscle for electrotransfer in zebrafish. GFP fluorescence and gfp-epi mRNA expression in tissues after electroporation were also studied by a polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence microscopy. gfp-epi expression was significantly correlated with decreased bacterial numbers and immune-related gene expression. These data demonstrate that electroporation of epinecidin-1 might have provoked an inflammatory response that accounts for the improvement in bacterial clearance."
0,"The presence of melanin in muscle fillets of farmed salmon represents a considerable quality problem for the salmon industry with major economic concerns. In this study, we have examined the presence of abnormal pigmentation in vaccinated versus unvaccinated Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., and evaluated possible differences between diploid and triploid fish. Furthermore, the impact of the smolt production regime at ambient (4.5 °C) versus elevated temperature (16 °C) was investigated. Pigmented muscle spots were analysed for the expression of genes involved in melanization (tyrosinase gene family) and immune-related response in addition to morphological investigations. The proportion of fish with intramuscular melanin deposits was not significantly different between vaccinated and unvaccinated fish, regardless of ploidy. However, an interaction between vaccination and smolt regime was shown, where smoltification at elevated temperature after vaccination increased the number of affected individuals compared with vaccination followed by simulated natural smoltification. Furthermore, there were overall more fish with melanin spots amongst the triploids compared with their diploid counterparts. Transcription of the tyrosinase gene family confirmed an onsite melanogenesis in all pigment spots. The histological examination and the expression of the immune-related genes revealed a chronic polyphasic myopathy that was not affected by vaccination, ploidy or smolt production regime. "
0,"Effect of phosphates on the heat-induced gel characteristics of myofibrillar protein (MP) from grass carp was investigated. Both heating and phosphates exerted significant influences. Heating induced more elastic, water-holding and less flowing gel. But phosphates had diverse effects at different temperatures. At 4 °C and 40 °C, phosphate as a dominant factor reduced the gel elasticity and resistance and increased flowability with increasing levels of phosphates. Furthermore, 280 mg/kg sodium pyrophosphate (SPP) or 440 mg/kg sodium triphosphates (STP) transformed MP from weak gel into concentrated solution. It clarified phosphates disentangled MP macromolecules and inhibited their aggregation and pre-gelation at low temperature. At 80 °C, heating accompanied with phosphates governed MP gelation. The appropriate level of phosphates (SPP superior to STP) endowed MP-phosphate gels with the lowest flowability and greatest elasticity, textural properties as well as finest microstructures. Besides, phosphates entrapped a portion of weak immobile water more tightly into smaller-sized pores of protein network."
0,"In mammals, Galectin-3 has been revealed to be widely expressed in immune cells and played important role in immune reactions. However, Galectin-3 is frequently less reported in teleost. In the present study, a molecular characterization and expression analysis of galectin-3 were conducted in GIFT strain Nile tilapia. The full-length cDNA is 1034 bp with 690 bp of protein coding sequences. The result of qRT-PCR showed that the mRNA of galectin-3 was widely expressed in various tissues (heart, liver, spleen, gill, kidney, brain, intestine, skin, muscle, and ovary), and the higher expression was observed in immune-related tissues (liver and spleen). The time-course expression analysis revealed that galectin-3 was significantly up-regulated in intestine (5 h, 50 h, and 7 d), liver (5 h, 50 h, and 7 d), spleen (5 and 50 h), head-kidney (5 and 50 h), gill (5 h and 7 d) after Streptococcus agalactiae challenge, and significantly up-regulated in intestine (18, 24, 36, 72, and 96 h), liver (6, 18, 24, 96 h, and 6 d), spleen (18, 24, 36, 72, and 96 h), head-kidney (6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72, and 96 h), and gill (12, 18, 24, and 36 h) after Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. Taken together, these data suggest that galectin-3 plays a role in immune responses in Nile tilapia after bacterial challenge."
0,"Although myoglobin (Mb) has been considered to be one of the well-characterized proteins, screening of post-genomic era databases revealed the lack of adequate information on teleost Mbs. The present study was aimed to investigate stability and functional features of Mbs from three teleosts of the same family. To unfold how primary structure influences the stability and function of proteins, Mbs were purified from the dark muscles of three carangids, namely, yellowtail, greater amberjack, and silver trevally. Thermostabilities measured by circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry revealed species-specific thermal denaturation pattern, i.e., silver trevally > yellowtail > greater amberjack Mbs. On the other hand, autoxidation rate constants of the ferrous forms of those three carangid Mbs showed positive correlation between the ferrous state of the heme iron and rising temperature. The order of autoxidation rate was in the order of greater amberjack > yellowtail > silver trevally Mbs. The finding of the present study denotes that the thermal stability is not necessarily correlated with the functional stability of carangid Mbs even though their primary structures shared high homology (84-94%)."
0,"In this study we describe the complete coding sequence for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 and IGFBP-related protein 1 (IGFBP-rP1) of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). We also report the characterisation of two gene paralogues of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5. Following 22 days restricted feeding (0 d) to achieve zero growth, fish were fed to satiation and sampled at 3, 5, 7, 14, 30 and 60 days. Expression profiles for genes involved in the IGF signalling pathway in fast myotomal muscle were determined using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The transition from zero to fast growth is characterised by constitutive upregulation of IGF-I and IGFBP-4, a transient increase in IGFBP-5.2, and downregulation of IGFBP-2.1, IGF-II, IGF2R (IGF-II receptor) and IGFR1a (IGF-I receptor a). Expression of IGFBP-2.2, IGFBP-5.1, IGFBP-6, IGFBP-rP1 and IGFR1b showed little or no response to feeding. Expression of the myogenic marker genes myogenin, MHC and MLC2 were higher with feed restriction, and decreased as an early response to feeding, before increasing to a peak at 14 days, corresponding with a peak in IGF-I expression. IGFBP-4, which contains a putative connective tissue localisation signal, was the only IGFBP constitutively upregulated following feeding, and was positively correlated with IGF-I expression. Together, these data show that switching to fast growth in Atlantic salmon skeletal muscle involves the local upregulation of IGF-I, IGFBP-5.2 and IGFBP-4, with downregulation of IGFBP-2.1."
0,"The growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis plays a central role in the regulation of growth in teleosts and has been shown to be affected by acclimation salinity. This study was aimed at characterizing the effects of rearing tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, in a tidally-changing salinity on the GH/IGF axis and growth. Tilapia were raised in fresh water (FW), seawater (SW), or in a tidally-changing environment, in which salinity is switched between FW (TF) and SW (TS) every 6h, for 4months. Growth was measured over all time points recorded and fish reared in a tidally-changing environment grew significantly faster than other groups. The levels of circulating growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), pituitary GH mRNA, gene expression of IGF-I, IGF-II, and growth hormone receptor 2 (GHR) in the muscle and liver were also determined. Plasma IGF-I was higher in FW and TS than in SW and TF tilapia. Pituitary GH mRNA was higher in TF and TS than in FW and SW tilapia. Gene expression of IGF-I in the liver and of GHR in both the muscle and liver changed between TF and TS fish. Fish growth was positively correlated with GH mRNA expression in the pituitary, and GHR mRNA expression in muscle and liver tissues. Our study indicates that rearing fish under tidally-changing salinities elicits a distinct pattern of endocrine regulation from that observed in fish reared in steady-state conditions, and may provide a new approach to increase tilapia growth rate and study the regulation of growth in euryhaline fish."

We found that SELENOT was expressed in cardiac extracts of juvenile and adult fish, located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) together with calsequestrin-2. Expression increased under acute hypoxia. On <i>ex vivo</i> isolated and perfused goldfish heart preparations, under normoxia, PSELT dose dependently increased stroke volume (<i>V</i> <sub>S</sub>), cardiac output [Formula: see text] and stroke work (SW), involving cAMP, PKA, L-type calcium channels, SERCA2a pumps and pAkt. Under hypoxia, PSELT did not affect myocardial contractility. Only at higher concentrations (10<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>-7</sup> mol l<sup>-1</sup>) was an increase of <i>V</i> <sub>S</sub> and [Formula: see text] observed. It also reduced the cardiac expression of 3-NT, a tissue marker of nitrosative stress, which increases under low oxygen availability. These data are the first to propose SELENOT 43-52 (PSELT) as a cardiac modulator in fish, with a potential protective role under hypoxia."
0,"We investigated the impact of six protein diets on oxidation and anti-oxidation status in the muscle of young rats. Rats were fed six protein diets for 14 days, including casein (control), and proteins isolated from soy, fish, chicken, pork and beef. Grx1, Trx1 and other oxidative metabolic indices in muscle were quantified. Compared with the casein diet, the soy protein diet had a similar oxidation level, but higher GSH and lower SOD activities. The chicken and fish protein groups had lower GSH and higher SOD activities, the pork protein group showed lower Grx1 levels than the casein group and the beef protein group showed the highest GSH, Grx1 and Trx1 levels as reflected by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analyses. Intake of meat proteins showed higher ROS and T-AOC but lower MDA levels than non-meat proteins, which may be due to the increase in Grx1 and Trx1 expression and other antioxidants. Meat proteins are more conducive to muscle of growing rats."
0,"One of the possibilities of using high-pressure technique in inactivation of microorganism is conducting this process at subzero temperature. However, for its practical application in meat preservation the appropriate properties of meat should be maintained. Therefore, the aim of this work was to examine the effect of pressure at subzero temperature (without freezing of water) on proteins and texture of mammal's and cold-adapted fish meat. The data showed that cod and salmon meat proteins were more susceptible to pressure-induced denaturation/aggregation than beef and pork proteins. Glucose and saccharose exerted protective effect on fish meat proteins treated with pressure of 111 MPa(tc) and -10 degrees C but not at 193 MPa(tc) and -20 degrees C. The pressure treatment under the latter conditions increased cook loss of fish meat but not of mammal's meat. However, after cooking the hardness of all kinds of pressurized meat was at the same level as that for unpressurized cooked samples."
0,"Tissue growth in most fishes occurs by muscular hyperplasia and hypertrophy, which are influenced by different regulatory factors, such as myostatin. The current study evaluated the influence of cultivation in hapas and earthen ponds on the diameter of white muscle fibers and on the myostatin (MSTN-1) gene in GIFT and Supreme varieties of tilapia. Fish of both varieties were reared for 204 days and then divided into four developmental stages. White muscle samples, corresponding to 100 fibers per slide, were collected from the middle region of fish of each variety and cultivation system, and were measured and divided into two classes representing hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Samples were subjected to real-time PCR to analyze gene expression. Hyperplasia decreased during the developing stages, coupled with increased hypertrophy. There was a higher rate of hypertrophy in fish raised in earthen ponds when compared to those raised in hapas, during juvenile and developing phases, and greater hypertrophic growth was observed in GIFT specimens when compared to Supreme specimens in earthen ponds. Since increased MSTN-1 gene expression was observed in GIFT specimens during the developing phase in pond cultivations, and in Supreme tilapia in hapas, MSTN-1 expression is related to greater hypertrophy. These results demonstrate the capacity for increased muscle growth in earthen pond cultivation in which the GIFT variety developed best. How the environment affects the growth of different tilapia varieties may be employed to optimize culture management and genetic improvement programs. Further investigations should aim to describe mechanisms affecting muscle growth and development."
0,"The kinetic properties of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) from skeletal muscle (PFKM) of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) were studied, after 10,900-fold purification to homogeneity. The native enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 662 kDa and is composed of 81 kDa subunits, suggesting a homooctameric structure. At physiological pH, S. aurata PFKM exhibited sigmoidal kinetics for the substrates, fructose-6-phosphate (fru-6-P) and ATP. Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (fru-2,6-P(2)) converted the saturation curves for fru-6-P to hyperbolic, activated PFKM synergistically with other positive effectors of the enzyme such as AMP and ADP, and counteracted ATP and citrate inhibition. The fish enzyme showed differences regarding other animal PFKs: it is active as a homooctamer, and fru-2,6-P(2) and pH affected affinity for ATP. By monitoring incorporation of (32)P from ATP, we show that fish PFKM is a substrate for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The mechanism involved in PFKM activation by phosphorylation contrasts with previous observations in other species: it increased V(max) and did not affect affinity for fru-6-P. Unlike the mammalian muscle enzyme, our findings support that phosphorylation of PFKM may exert a major role during starvation in fish muscle."
0,"Health benefits, flavour quality indicators and physical properties were analysed after feeding grass carp graded concentrations of soybean isoflavones (SIF) (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 mg/kg) for 60 days. The results demonstrated that optimal dietary SIF supplementation improved the protein and total PUFA content, especially healthcare n-3 PUFA (C18: 3n-3, EPA and DHA), and increased the flavour-related free amino acid [especially umami amino acid] and 5'-inosine monophosphate content, improving the health benefits and flavour quality indicators in the muscle of grass carp. In addition, optimal dietary SIF supplementation (25 or 50 mg SIF/kg diet) enhanced some physical properties [water-holding capacity and tenderness] and increased the collagen content; however, it reduced cathepsin activity and apoptosis. SIF supplementation enhanced the glutathione content and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (except CuZnSOD) by regulating their gene expression. The gene expression could be regulated by NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signalling in the muscle of grass carp. We demonstrated that optimal dietary SIF supplementation elevated the health benefits, flavour quality indicators and physical properties of fish muscle."
0,"Connective tissue growth factor (ctgf) is involved in the proliferation, migration, adhesion of cell, and the constituent of extracellular matrix, which plays an important role in embryogenesis, angiogenesis, wound repair, and fibrosis diseases. In this study, the cDNA sequence of grass carp ctgf gene was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method; then, the characteristics of this gene and the predicted protein sequence were analyzed by bioinformatics methods, and the tissue differential expression pattern was detected by the quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that the grass carp ctgf gene has a full-length of 2223 bp, encoding 343 amino acids. The deduced CTGF protein is a hydrophilic and secretary protein with a molecular mass of 37,978.2 Da and an isoelectric point of 8.22. The signal peptide locates between residue positions 1 and 22 of the polypeptide chain. The protein contains α-helix, β-strand, and loops. The CTGF protein of grass carp shows a homology of 98%, 96%, 91%, and 91% with Wuchang bream (Megalobrama amblycephala), zebrafish (Danio rerio), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), and Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus). The grass carp ctgf gene expressed significantly higher in blood and spleen than that in other tissues (P < 0.05). The low expression tissues included the heart, gill, skin, muscle, kidney, brain, and intestinal, and the lowest expression tissue was the liver. The results are consistent with the function of this gene."
0,"The influence of ultrasonics combined with microwave thawing (UMT) and ultrasonics combined with far-infrared thawing (UIT) on the water migration and protein denaturation of red drum were studied. Five treatments were used: ultrasonics thawing (UT), microwave thawing (MT), far-infrared thawing (IT), UIT and UMT were used for thawing red drum filets. Moisture migration and protein aggregation were studied using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and particle size, respectively. Raman spectra and fluorescence spectra were used to study the secondary and tertiary structure of protein. SEM was done to observe the fiber microstructure. The results showed that UMT and UIT can maintained protein stability more than other thawing methods and retained the fiber structure of the muscle. Besides, immobilized water in fiber bundles network also had no significant changes compared with fresh samples. Thus, ultrasonics combined with far infrared or microwave thawing were used to decrease protein denaturation and water migration during the thawing of Red drum fillets."
0,"In contrast to mice or zebrafish, trout exhibits post-larval muscle growth through hypertrophy and formation of new myofibers (hyperplasia). The muscle fibers are formed by the fusion of mononucleated cells (myoblasts) regulated by several muscle-specific proteins such as Myomaker or Myomixer. In this work, we identified a unique gene encoding a Myomixer protein of 77 amino acids (aa) in the trout genome. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree showed moderate conservation of the overall protein sequence across teleost fish (61% of aa identity between trout and zebrafish Myomixer sequences). Nevertheless, the functionally essential motif, AxLyCxL is perfectly conserved in all studied sequences of vertebrates. Using in situ hybridization, we observed that myomixer was highly expressed in the embryonic myotome, particularly in the hyperplasic area. Moreover, myomixer remained readily expressed in white muscle of juvenile (1 and 20 g) although its expression decreased in mature fish. We also showed that myomixer is up-regulated during muscle regeneration and in vitro myoblasts differentiation. Together, these data indicate that myomixer expression is consistently associated with the formation of new myofibers during somitogenesis, post-larval growth and muscle regeneration in trout."
0,"We found that the tryptic digest of Alaska pollack protein exhibits a glucose-lowering effect in KK-Ay mice, a type II diabetic model. We then searched for glucose-lowering peptides in the digest. Ala-Asn-Gly-Glu-Val-Ala-Gln-Trp-Arg (ANGEVAQWR) was identified from a peak of the HPLC fraction selected based on the glucose-lowering activity in an insulin resistance test using ddY mice. ANGEVAQWR (3 mg kg(-1)) decreased the blood glucose level after intraperitoneal administration. Among its fragment peptides, the C-terminal tripeptide, Gln-Trp-Arg (QWR, 1 mg kg(-1)), lowered the blood glucose level, suggesting that the C-terminal is critical for glucose-lowering activity. QWR also enhanced glucose uptake into C2C12, a mouse skeletal muscle cell line. QWR did not induce the phosphorylation of serine/threonine protein kinase B (Akt) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We also demonstrated that QWR lowered the blood glucose level in NSY and KK-Ay, type II diabetic models. "
0,"Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) subjected to three consecutive, alternating treatments with emamectin benzoate (EMB) and deltamethrin (DM) during outbreaks of Caligus rogercresseyi in a farm located in southern Chile (Hornopiren, Chiloé), were studied to determine the effects of these treatments on the protein and enzymatic activity levels of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A), flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in different tissues. Consecutive and alternating EMB/DM treatments resulted in a 10-fold increase and 3-fold decrease of CYP1A protein levels in the intestine and gills, respectively. Notably, CYP1A activity levels decreased in most of the analyzed tissues. FMO protein and activity levels markedly increased in the kidney and the intestine. GST was up-regulated in all tissues, either as protein or enzyme activity. When comparing consecutive EMB/DM treatments against previous studies of EMB treatment alone, CYP1A activity levels were similarly diminished, except in muscle. Likewise, FMO activity levels were increased in most of the analyzed tissues, particularly in the muscle, kidney, and intestine. The increases observed for GST were essentially unchanged between consecutive EMB/DM and EMB only treatments. These results indicate that consecutive EMB/DM treatments in rainbow trout induce the expression and activity of FMO and GST enzymes and decrease CYP1A activity. These altered activities of detoxification enzymes could generate imbalances in metabolic processes, synthesis, degradation of hormones and complications associated with drug interactions. It is especially important when analyzing possible effects of consecutive antiparasitic treatments on withholding periods and salmon farming yields."
0,"Warmer seawater temperatures are expected to increase harmful algal blooms (HABs) occurrence, intensity, and distribution. Yet, the potential interactions between abiotic stressors and HABs are still poorly understood from ecological and seafood safety perspectives. The present study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the bioaccumulation/depuration mechanisms and ecotoxicological responses of juvenile gilthead seabream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) exposed to paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) under different temperatures (18, 21, 24 °C). PST were detected in fish at the peak of the exposure period (day five, 0.22 µg g<sup>-1</sup> N-sulfocarbamoylGonyautoxin-1-2 (C1 and C2), 0.08 µg g<sup>-1</sup> Decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX) and 0.18 µg g<sup>-1</sup> Gonyautoxin-5 (B1)), being rapidly eliminated (within the first 24 h of depuration), regardless of exposure temperature. Increased temperatures led to significantly higher PST contamination (275 µg STX eq. kg<sup>-1</sup>). During the trial, fish antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT; glutathione S-transferase, GST) in both muscle and viscera were affected by temperature, whereas a significant induction of heat shock proteins (HSP70), Ubiquitin (Ub) activity (viscera), and lipid peroxidation (LPO; muscle) was observed under the combination of warming and PST exposure. The differential bioaccumulation and biomarker responses observed highlight the need to further understand the interactive effects between PST and abiotic stressors, to better estimate climate change impacts on HABs events, and to develop mitigation strategies to overcome the potential risks associated with seafood consumption."
0,"Hybridization creates novel gene combinations that may generate important evolutionary novelty, but may also reduce existing adaptation by interrupting inherent biological processes, such as genotype-environment interactions. Hybridization often causes substantial change in patterns of gene expression, which, in turn, may cause phenotypic change. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and cutthroat trout (O. clarkii) produce viable hybrids in the wild, and introgressive hybridization with introduced rainbow trout is a major conservation concern for native cutthroat trout. The two species differ in body shape, which is likely an evolutionary adaptation to their native environments, and their hybrids tend to show intermediate morphology. The characterization of gene expression patterns may provide insights on the genetic basis of hybrid and parental morphologies, as well as on the ecological performance of hybrids in the wild. Here, we evaluated the expression of eight growth-related genes (MSTN-1a, MSTN-1b, MyoD1a, MyoD1b, MRF-4, IGF-1, IGF-2, and CAST-L) and the relationship of these genes with growth traits (length, weight, and condition factor) in six line crosses: both parental species, both reciprocal F1 hybrids, and both first-generation backcrosses (F1 x rainbow trout and F1 x cutthroat trout). Four of these genes were differentially expressed among rainbow, cutthroat, and their hybrids. Transcript abundance was significantly correlated with growth traits across the parent species, but not across hybrids. Our findings suggest that rainbow and cutthroat trout exhibit differences in muscle growth regulation, that transcriptional networks may be modified by hybridization, and that hybridization disrupts intrinsic relationships between gene expression and growth patterns that may be functionally important for phenotypic adaptations.

0,"Thioredoxins (TRxs) are a family of small, highly conserved proteins that are essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. TRx1, which contains a conserved redox-active site, Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys, is a proinflammatory cytokine, B cell growth factor, macrophage migration inhibiting factor (MIF), and an immune regulatory cytokine. The TRx1 homologue cDNA was isolated from the rock bream LPS-stimulated liver cDNA library, RbTRx1. RbTRx1 consists of 730 bp full-length cDNA with a 324 bp open reading frame encoding 108 amino acids. When compared with other known TRx1 peptide sequences, the most conserved region of the RbTRx1 peptide was the redox-active site Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys. Phylogenetic analysis grouped the RbTRx1 with other vertebrate TRx1 peptides. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed the presence of RbTRx1 transcripts in liver, gill, kidney, and muscle. The expression of RbTRx1 mRNA in kidney leukocytes was upregulated after bacterial and viral challenge. The kidney leukocytes were treated with a high concentration of rRbTRx1, which significantly enhanced cell proliferation (1 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml) and viability under oxidative stress (10 μg/ml)."
0,"Proteinase inhibitory activity of sarcoplasmic protein (SP) extracted from common carp (Cyprinus carpio) muscle and its gel-improving ability were investigated. SPs displayed 89% and 54% inhibitory activity toward trypsin at 40 and 65 °C, respectively. Protein bands with molecular mass of 69, 50, 44, 41, and 35 kDa appeared on trypsin inhibitory activity staining under nonreducing condition when incubated at 40 °C, while 2 protein bands at 54 and 35 kDa were observed at 65 °C. Addition of SP at 0.18 g protein/100 g increased textural properties of threadfin bream surimi gel. However, when SP was added in combination with various CaCl(2) concentrations (0.1% to 0.5%) it did not further improve textural properties as compared to the addition of SP alone. Retention of myosin heavy chain of threadfin bream surimi was greater with the addition of SP. These results indicated that the gel-enhancing effect of common carp SP was due to the inhibitory activity toward endogenous trypsin-like proteinases in threadfin bream surimi."
1,Sarcoplasmic protein from common carp muscle could be used as a functional protein ingredient that minimizes muscle proteolysis and improves textural properties of surimi containing trypsin-like endogenous proteinases.
0,"The oligopeptide transporter (PepT1) is located on the brush-border membrane of the intestinal epithelium which has been regarded as a mediator of protein absorption. Here, we cloned and characterized PepT1 genes from diploid (red crucian carp), triploid and tetraploid fish. Then, the PepT1 expression pattern in different tissues and embryogenesis were assayed. Meanwhile, using real-time PCR and western blotting, we showed the expression profiles of diets with different protein levels, protein sources and additives (sodium butyrate) in triploids. The cDNAs of the three different ploidy fishes have a high sequence similarity of PepT1 among vertebrates. PepT1 mRNA expression was also developmentally regulated and showed the strongest expression around the 2-cell and 4-cell stage in all three kinds of fishes. The maternal transcripts were first detected in eggs and dropped from blastula stage to muscle contraction stage. Tissue expression studies showed higher expression of PepT1 genes in the intestines of fishes compared with other tissues. In adults, triploids showed significantly higher expression levels of PepT1 in the intestines of the three kinds of ploidy fishes during breeding season and non-breeding season. In addition, high or low protein level diets both promote PepT1 expression in the intestine. We also confirmed that fish meal showed a significant increase in PepT1 expression than soybean meal in triploid intestines. Furthermore, sodium butyrate additives induce PepT1 expression that may be mediated by CDX2 and CREB. This research provides a new insight into protein absorption and its regulation in triploid fish.

0,"This study aims to investigate the effect of pullulan on the denaturation of the myofibrillar protein of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) during frozen storage at -18°C for 30days. Pullulan or commercial cryoprotectant (1g dry weight) were added to 100g of the myofibrillar protein of grass carp (C. idella), respectively, which was frozenly stored at -18°C for 30days, and the changes in the state of unfrozen of water, solubility, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-adenylpyrophosphatase (ATP<sub>ase</sub>) activity, and sulfhydryl content of myofibrils were monitored during frozen storage. Pullulan addition increased unfrozen water and sulfhydryl contents in the myofibrillar protein and solubility and ATP<sub>ase</sub> activity of the myofibrillar protein compared with those of the control during frozen storage at -18°C. Moreover, the cryoprotective efficiency of pullulan on the myofibrillar protein of grass carp (C. idella) was higher than that of commercial cryoprotectant."
0,"The evolution of phenotypic traits is a key process in diversification of life. However, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of such evolutionary novelties are largely unknown. Here we address the origin of bulbus arteriosus (BA), an organ of evolutionary novelty seen in the teleost heart outflow tract (OFT), which sophisticates their circulatory system. The BA is a unique organ that is composed of smooth muscle while the OFTs in other vertebrates are composed of cardiac muscle. Here we reveal that the teleost-specific extracellular matrix (ECM) gene, elastin b, was generated by the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication and neofunctionalized to contribute to acquisition of the BA by regulating cell fate determination of cardiac precursor cells into smooth muscle. Furthermore, we show that the mechanotransducer yap is involved in this cell fate determination. Our findings reveal a mechanism of generating evolutionary novelty through alteration of cell fate determination by the ECM. "
0,"A sarcoplasmic serine proteinase (SSP) was purified from threadfin bream (Nemipterus virgatus) belly muscle by ammonium sulfate precipitation and a series of chromatographies including Q-Sepharose, Phenyl Sepharose and Superdex 200. The SSP was purified 1967 folds with a yield of 4.8%. The molecular weight of the SSP was estimated to be 43.5 kDa and 22.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the two protein bands were determined as IVGGYEXQPYSQAHQVSLNSGY and corresponded. It is suggested that the SSP exists as a homodimer. Optimum pH and temperature were 9.5 and 50 °C, using Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA as a substrate. Substrate specificity and effects of inhibitors indicated that the SSP was a trypsin-like serine proteinase. The SSP was responsible for hydrolyzing myosin heavy chain (MHC) and inducing modori phenomenon in the threadfin bream surimi gel. Thus, the SSP was considered as a modori-inducing proteinase."
0,"As an intracellular pattern recognition receptor (PRR), laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) plays a pivotal role in detecting nucleic acids of invading pathogens and simultaneously modulating signaling by retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) in type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway. Nevertheless, the underlying antiviral transcription mechanism of LGP2 remains obscure. The present study attempted to reveal the methylation levels of CiLGP2 (Ctenopharyngodon idella LGP2) in muscle and spleen of grass carp and their association with the resistance against grass carp reovirus (GCRV). By prediction, the CpG island was 133 bp in length in 5'-flanking region, containing six candidate CpG loci, whose methylation statuses were investigated by virtue of the bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) among muscle and spleen tissues in 120 individuals that were divided into resistant/susceptible groups after a challenge experiment, and the association analysis was performed with Chi-square test. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to ascertain the interrelation between methylation status and transcription of CiLGP2. The CpG sites at -1394, -1366, -1331 and -1314 nt were identified as hypermethylated, inversely unmethylated at -1350 CpG site. The -1411 CpG site presented six methylation patterns as well as one mentionable type of mutation triggered by spontaneous deamination. Although there was no statistically significant difference on DNA methylation with resistance against GCRV at -1411 CpG site, the methylation levels were significantly lower in spleen than those in muscle, accompanied by higher mRNA expression of CiLGP2 in spleen. Notably, DNA methylation may be conceivably serve as an essential regulatory factor for CiLGP2 antiviral transcription in spleen. This research first demonstrated the relationship between DNA methylation and LGP2 gene expression, preliminary revealed the underlying transcription mechanism of CiLGP2 against GCRV as well as provided potential references and laid a theoretical foundation for viral recognition and regulation research of LGP2 in vertebrates."
0,"The activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in loach and sturgeon embryogenesis as well as in red and white skeletal muscles of loach was studied. The specific activity of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms of superoxide dismutase in developing sturgeon embryos was higher than in loach embryos, which may be due to oxygen conditions under which these species develop in nature. A similar dependence was also observed for the activity of glutathione peroxidase in embryos of these fish species. A comparative study of specific superoxide dismutase activity in loach and sturgeon embryos and in loach skeletal muscles showed that the activity of cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase is maximum in red and white muscles and minimum in loach embryos, whereas the activity of the mitochondrial form of this enzyme is maximum in red skeletal muscles."
0,"Plasmid DNAs containing Siniperca chuatsi rhabdovirus (SCRV) glycoprotein gene (pcDNA-G) and nucleoprotein gene (pcDNA-N) were constructed, and used to determine the antiviral immune response elicited by DNA vaccination in mandarin fish. In vitro and in vivo expression of the plasmid constructs was confirmed in transfected cells and muscle tissues of vaccinated fish by Western blot, indirect immunofluorescence or RT-PCR analysis. Fish injected with pcDNA-G exhibited protective effect against SCRV challenge with a relative percent survival (RPS) of 77.5%, but no significant protection (RPS of 2.5%) was observed in fish vaccinated with pcDNA-N. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that vaccination with pcDNA-G decreased histological lesions and suppressed the virus replication in fish target organs, e.g. kidney, liver, spleen, gill and heart. Transcriptional analysis further revealed that the expression levels of type I IFN system genes including interferon regulation factor-7 (IRF-7) gene, myxovirus resistance (Mx) gene and virus inhibitory protein (Viperin) gene were strongly up-regulated after injection with pcDNA-G, whereas the level of transcription of immunoglobulin M (IgM) gene did not show a statistically significant change. These results reveal that type I IFN antiviral immune response is rapidly triggered by the plasmid DNA containing rhabdovirus glycoprotein gene in fish, which offers an explanation of molecular mechanisms for DNA vaccination inducing mandarin fish resist to SCRV disease."
0,"Photoperiod is associated to phenotypic plasticity of somatic growth in several teleost species. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are currently unknown but it is likely that epigenetic regulation by methyltransferases is involved. The MLL (mixed-lineage leukaemia) family comprises histone methyltransferases that play a critical role in regulating gene expression during early development in mammals. So far, these genes have received scant attention in teleost fish. In the present study, the mean weight of Atlantic cod juveniles reared under continuous illumination was found to be 13% greater than those kept under natural photoperiod conditions for 120 days. We newly determined cDNA sequences of five mll (mll1, mll2, mll3a, mll4b and mll5) and two setd1 (setd1a and setd1ba) paralogues from Atlantic cod. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the cod genes clustered within the appropriate mll clade and comparative mapping of mll paralogues showed that these genes lie within a region of conserved synteny among teleosts. All mll and setd1 genes were highly expressed in gonads and fast muscle of adult cod, albeit at different levels, and they were differentially regulated with photoperiod in muscle of juvenile fish. Following only one day of exposure to constant light, mll1, mll4b and setd1a were up to 57% lower in these fish compared to the natural photoperiod group. In addition, mRNA expression of myogenic regulatory factors (myog and myf-5) and pax7 in fast muscle was also affected by different photoperiod conditions. Notably, myog was significantly elevated in the continuous illumination group throughout the time course of the experiment. The absence of a day/night cycle is associated with a generalised decrease in mll expression concomitant with an increase in myog transcript levels in fast muscle of Atlantic cod, which may be involved in the observed epigenetic regulation of growth by photoperiod in this species."
0,"We wanted to clarify whether gel properties can be affected by in vivo or in vitro myofibrillar protein oxidation and, thus, to provide relevant information and a scientific foundation for the processing of gel products. To accomplish this, we measured the changes in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), total disulfide (SS) content, surface hydrophobicity (So-ANS), carbonyl content, and gel texture and water-holding capacity (WHC) of isolated myofibrillar protein from bighead carp fillets during frozen storage and under different H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations, which were used to represent in vivo and in vitro conditions, respectively. The results indicated that a certain range in content of disulfide crosslinks (0.91mol/10<sup>5</sup>g protein) would promote gel hardness. Mild protein oxidation caused by a certain degree of frozen storage and hydroxyl radicals can promote gel texture and WHC. Based on those results, freezing bighead carp for a certain period can be used to produce gel products."

1,"Parvalbumins (PVs) from the white muscle of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthy molitrix) were purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatography including DEAE-Sepharose and Superdex 75. Three PV isoforms-PV-I, PV-II, and PV-III-were obtained and their molecular masses as estimated by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were 12, 11, and 14 kDa, respectively. All the PVs could be detected by anti-frog PV monoclonal antibody. PV-I and PV-II were quite possibly glycoproteins, while PV-III was not glycosylated, as analyzed by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. Thermal stability revealed that PV-I and PV-II easily formed polymers, while these proteins were stable in a pH range of 4.0-10.0. A PV gene encoding 110 amino acid residues was cloned and it revealed high identity with PVs from other species of fish."

0,"There are 19 Wnt genes in mammals that belong to 12 subfamilies. Wnt signaling pathways participate in regulating numerous homeostatic and developmental processes in animals. However, the function of Wnt10b in fatty acid synthesis remains unclear in fish species. In the present study, we uncovered the role of the Wnt10b signaling pathway in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis in the muscle of zebrafish. The gene of Wnt10b was overexpressed in the muscle of zebrafish using pEGFP-N1-Wnt10b vector injection, which significantly decreased the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), but increased the expression of β-catenin, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα). Moreover, the activity and mRNA expression of key lipogenic enzymes ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthetase (FAS), and the content of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) were also significantly decreased. Furthermore, interference of the Wnt10b gene significantly inhibited the expression of β-catenin, PPARγ, and C/EBPα, but significantly induced the expression of GSK-3β, FAS, ACC, and ACL. The content of NEFA, TC, and TG as well as the activity of FAS, ACC, and ACL significantly increased. Thus, our results showed that Wnt10b participates in regulating fatty acid synthesis via β-catenin, C/EBPα and PPARγ in the muscle of zebrafish."
0,"This study examined regional distribution and corticosteroid-induced alterations of claudin (cldn) transcript abundance in teleost fish skin. Regional comparison of mRNA encoding 20 Cldns indicated that 12 exhibit differences in abundance along the dorsoventral axis of skin. However, relative abundance of cldns (i.e. most to least abundant) remained similar in different skin regions. Several cldns appear to be present in the epidermis and dermal vasculature whereas others are present only in the epidermis. Increased circulating cortisol levels significantly altered mRNA abundance of 10 cldns in a region specific manner, as well as corticosteroid receptors and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (type 2). Epidermis and epidermal mucous cell morphometrics also altered in response to cortisol, exhibiting changes that appear to enhance skin barrier properties. Taken together, data provide a first look at spatial variation in the molecular physiology of the teleost fish integument TJ complex and region-specific sensitivity to an endocrine factor."
0,"A randomised trial was carried out to determine the effect of supplementation of fish oil among 51 children with leukaemia aged 4 to 12 years on appetite level, caloric intake, body weight and lean body mass. They were randomly allocated into the trial group (TG) and the control group (CG). At baseline, 30.8% of TG subjects and 44.0% of CG subjects were malnourished and 7.7% of subject from TG and 28.0% from CG were classified as stunted. The majority of subjects from TG and CG were in the mild malnutrition category for mid upper arm muscle circumference (MUAMC)-for-age. The TG group showed significant increment in MUAMC (0.13 cm vs -0.09 cm) compared with CG at 8 weeks (p<0.001). There was a significant higher increase for appetite level (0.12±0.33) (p<0.05) and an increasing trend on energy and protein intake in the TG group (213±554 kcal; 3.64 ±26.8 g) than in the CG group. In conclusion, supplementation of fish oil has a positive effect on appetite level, caloric intake and MUAMC among children with leukaemia."
0,"The aims of the present study were to clone the full-length cDNA of adipose triglyceridelipase (ATGL) and to analyze its expression after lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). The cDNA obtained covered 1801 bp with an open reading frame of 1500 bp encoding 499 amino acids. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis show the best identity with Cyprinus carpio (86%). The ATGL protein shared a highly conserved 169-amino acid patatin domain, containing a glycine-rich motif, an active serine hydrolase motif, and an aspartic active site. The highest ATGL expression was observed in the liver followed by muscle, whereas relatively low values were detected in the brain and adipose. TNF-α is regarded as an important factor in regulating fat metabolism. Here, LPS was used to induce TNF-α in vivo to verify whether TNF-α can affect ATGL expression. TNF-α expression in liver and muscle is increased and remains unchanged in adipose tissue and brain. The variation of ATGL activity is consistent with that of TNF-α gene expression. Next, we explored the mechanism by which LPS-induced TNF-α mediates the mRNA expression of ATGL in the liver and muscle. For liver, the mRNA levels of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were increased by LPS-induced TNF-α. Differencing from the situation in the liver, there was a near-significant decrease trend in the expression of SIRT1 in muscle. Those results indicated that the ATGL gene of blunt snout bream shared a high similarity with the other vertebrates. The expression level of ATGL in tissues with high-fat content was intended to be high. LPS can induce ATGL expression perhaps related to TNF-α."
0,"The conformational stability of tropomyosins from salmonids fishes has been investigated under a variety of conditions (salt, pH and osmolyte) using electronic circular dichroism. Every salmonid tropomyosin (from: fast skeletal muscle; slow skeletal muscle and heart) is less resistant to heat-induced denaturation than rabbit alpha-striated tropomyosin. Induction of unfolding, by application of a linear temperature gradient, yields a distinct profile for each protein (0.1 M salt, pH 7, plus dithiothreitol): fast tropomyosin (Tms 24 and 40 degrees C major); cardiac tropomyosin (Tm, 36 degrees C) and slow tropomyosin (Tms, 39 major and 47 degrees C). Correlation of these results, and others obtained under different solvent conditions, with the known sequences (Jackman DM, Waddleton DM, Younghusband B, Heeley DH (1996) Further characterisation of fast, slow and cardiac muscle tropomyosins from salmonid fish. Eur. J. Biochem. 242:363-371) provides insight into how the coiled-coil may have adapted to cold. The most variable sections of sequence encompass residues 9-49, 73-87 and 172-216. In two of these regions there is a pair of closely-spaced glycines, namely at residues 24 and 27 in fast skeletal tropomyosin and residues 83 and 87 in cardiac tropomyosin. A region of low stability is located in the carboxy-terminal half of the isoform from fast skeletal muscle. This segment cooperatively unfolds in the 20 degrees range and accounts for 20% of the total far-UV ellipticity change under reducing conditions. It is unresponsive to increasing ionic strength and the presence of osmolyte but is sensitive to oxidation at cysteine 190. A likely contributor to the relative instability is a substitution at position 179 whereby fast skeletal tropomyosin, but not the other tropomyosins under examination, has lost a ""d"" position alanine in the fifth cluster and gained a polar side-chain."
0,"Salinity decreases are experienced by many marine elasmobranchs. To understand how these fishes cope with hyposmotic stress on a cellular level, we used the spiny dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) as a model to test whether a reciprocal relationship exists between the cell's two primary protein protection mechanisms, the chemical (e.g., trimethylamine oxide, TMAO) and molecular (e.g., heat shock protein 70, HSP70) chaperone systems. This relationship is interesting given that many elasmobranchs are expected to gain water and lose osmolytes, chemical chaperones, and ions as they osmoconform to new, lowered salinity. Dogfish were cannulated for repeated blood sampling and exposed to 70% seawater (SW) for 48 h. These hyposmotic conditions had no effect on red blood cell (RBC) and white muscle TMAO concentrations, and did not result in HSP70 induction or signs of protein damage (i.e., increased ubiquitin), suggesting that TMAO levels were sufficiently protective in these tissues. However, in the gill, we observed a significant decrease in TMAO concentration and a significant induction of HSP70 as well as signs of protein damage. In the face of this cellular stress response, gill Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA) activity significantly increased during hyposmotic conditions, as expected. We suggest that this functional preservation in the gill is partly the result of HSP70 induction with lowered salinity. We conclude a reciprocal relationship between TMAO and HSP70 in the gills of dogfish as a result of in vivo hyposmotic stress. When osmotically induced protein damage surpasses the protective capacity of remaining TMAO, HSP70 is induced to preserve tissue and organismal function."
0,"The endogenous production of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in carnivorous teleost species inhabiting freshwater environments is poorly understood. Although a predatory lifestyle could potentially supply sufficient LC-PUFA to satisfy the requirements of these species, the nutrient-poor characteristics of the freshwater food web could impede this advantage. In this study, we report the cloning and functional characterisation of an elongase enzyme in the LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway from striped snakehead (Channa striata), which is a strict freshwater piscivore that shows high deposition of LC-PUFA in its flesh. We also functionally characterised a previously isolated fatty acyl desaturase cDNA from this species. Results showed that the striped snakehead desaturase is capable of Δ4 and Δ5 desaturation activities, while the elongase showed the characteristics of Elovl5 elongases. Collectively, these findings reveal that striped snakehead exhibits the genetic resources to synthesise docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3). Both genes are expressed at considerable levels in the brain and the liver. In liver, both genes were up-regulated by dietary C18 PUFA, although this increase did not correspond to a significant rise in the deposition of muscle LC-PUFA. Brain tissue of fish fed with plant oil diets showed higher expression of fads2 gene compared to fish fed with fish oil-based diet, which could ensure DHA levels remain constant under limited dietary DHA intake. This suggests the importance of DHA production from EPA via the ∆4 desaturation step in order to maintain an optimal reserve of DHA in the neuronal tissues of carnivores. "
0,"Peptides from hydrolysates of fish proteins and from cheeses were analysed for inhibition of prolyl endopeptidase (PE) isolated from porcine muscle. Muscles of cod, salmon, and trout were homogenised and incubated at pH 4.0 with pepsin and then at pH 7.5 with trypsin to obtain fish protein hydrolysates. Homogenates were incubated without exogenous enzymes at pH 4.0 and 7.5 to obtain fish protein autolysates. Water-soluble extracts from ""rakfisk"" (a Norwegian fermented/autolysed trout muscle dish) and water-soluble extracts from Cheddar, Norvegia, Jarlsberg, and Blue cheese were also prepared. Peptides in the supernatants obtained after heat-treatment of fish hydrolysates, autolysates and water-soluble extracts of rakfisk and cheeses at 95 degrees C for 15 min were analysed for inhibition of PE. Inhibition was also measured in peptide fractions separated by reversed-phase high-performance chromatography and by gel permeation chromatography. The peptide fractions from fish hydrolysates, fish autolysates, and water-soluble extracts of cheeses inhibited PE in hydrolysing Z-Gly-Pro-amidomethylcoumarin. Inhibition by peptides from rakfisk was negligible. Pepsin + trypsin hydrolysates from the three fish species contained PE inhibitory peptides with a broad range of apparent hydrophobicity and apparent molecular mass. Autolysates from muscles of the 3 fish species contained narrow peptide peaks of different molecular mass and different apparent hydrophobicity with strong PE inhibitory activity. The content of hydrophilic inhibitory peptides was lower in cheeses than in pepsin + trypsin hydrolysates of fish muscle."
0,"In the present study, seven phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) members (PI3KCa, PI3KCb, PI3KCd, PI3KCg, PI3KC2a, PI3KC2b and PI3KC3, respectively) were isolated and characterized from yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco, and their roles in insulin-induced changes of protein metabolism were determined. These seven PI3Ks can be divided into three classes, class I (including PI3KCa, PI3KCb, PI3KCd and PI3KCg), class II (including PI3KC2a and PI3KC2b) and class III (only including PI3KC3). Compared with mammals, all of these members share similar domain structure. Their mRNAs were widely expressed across ten tested tissues (liver, white muscle, spleen, brain, gill, mesenteric fat, intestine, heart, kidney and ovary), but at variable levels. In the in vivo study, insulin treatment significantly increased hepatic protein content at 3h, accompanied with reduced plasma total amino acid contents and liver ALT activity, and with increased total RNA content and the mRNA levels of PI3KCb, PI3KC2a, AKT2, mTORC1 and S6K1 in liver. At 6h and 12h, insulin injection showed no significant effect on liver protein content and plasma total amino acid, but reduced liver ALT activity and increased liver total RNA and the mRNA levels of AKT2, mTORC1 and S6K1 in liver at 6h. In the in vitro study, insulin incubation also tended to increase protein content of hepatocytes, accompanied with reduced cell medium total amino acid contents and hepatocytes ALT activity, and increased total RNA content and the mRNA levels of PI3KCb, PI3KC2a, AKT2, mTORC1 and S6K1 in hepatocytes. However, insulin treatment showed no significant effect on GDH activity and mRNA expression of PI3KCa, PI3KCd, PI3KCg, PI3KC2b, PI3KC3 and eEF2 both in the in vivo and in vitro studies. Effects of insulin on the mRNA levels of eIF-4E and 4E-BP1 were different between the in vivo and in vitro studies, and also time-dependent. Compared to single insulin group, insulin+wortmannin group increased ALT activity at 6h but reduced T-RNA content at 6 and 12h. AKT2 and S6K1 mRNA levels at 6 and 12h, mRNA levels of mTORC1, 4E-BP1 and eEF2 at 3 and 6h, and EIF-4E mRNA levels at 3 and 12h, PI3KCb and PI3KC2a mRNA levels were significantly lower in insulin+wortmannin group than those in single insulin group. Thus, our study demonstrated that among seven PI3K members, PI3KCb and PI3KC2a were more sensitive to the insulin signaling pathway, and insulin stimulated hepatic protein synthesis in yellow catfish through PI3K signaling pathway."
0,"Recently, a few fish proteins have been described with a high homology to B-type lectins of monocotyledonous plants. Because of their mannose binding activity, they have been ascribed a role in innate immunity. By screening various fish venoms for their integrin inhibitory activity, we isolated a homologous protein from the fin stings and skin mucus of the scorpionfish (Scorpaena plumieri). This protein inhibits alpha1beta1 integrin binding to basement membrane collagen IV. By protein chemical and spectroscopic means, we demonstrated that this fish protein, called plumieribetin, is a homotetramer and contains a high content of anti-parallel beta strands, similar to the mannose-binding monocot B-lectins. It lacks both N-linked glycoconjugates and common O-glycan motifs. Despite its B-lectin-like structure, plumieribetin binds to alpha1beta1 integrin irrespective of N-glycosylation, suggesting a direct protein-protein interaction. This interaction is independent of divalent cations. On the cellular level, plumieribetin failed to completely detach hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells and primary arterial smooth muscle cells from the collagen IV fragment CB3. However, plumieribetin weakened the cell-collagen contacts, reduced cell spreading, and altered the actin cytoskeleton, after the compensating alpha2beta1 integrin was blocked. The integrin inhibiting effect of plumieribetin adds a new function to the B-lectin family, which is known for pathogen defense."
0,"DNA methylation is susceptible to various environmental factors such as salinity, temperature and nutritional conditions, and can affect gene function, organ metabolism, body growth and development. In order to explore the effect of starvation on growth-related genes in large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), we studied methylation of the global DNA and growth-related genes (MSTN1,MSTN2,IGF1,IGF2) and the corresponding mRNA expressions, using ELISA-based technique, bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) technique and quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) respectively. The results showed that the global DNA methylation levels were significantly different (p <0.05) between the experimental group and the control group at starvation 14d, 21d in muscle and at starvation 7d, 14d, 28d, and re-feeding 7d in liver. The CpG islands of MSTN1, MSTN2, IGF1 and IGF2 were enriched in exons rather than promoters. The proximal promoter of MSTN1 and IGF1 and the exon1 of MSTN2 had almost no methylation at all treatment stages. The methylation status in MSTN1 exon 1 and IGF2 exon 2 varied from different starvation time, and started to have significant differences on starvation 7d (p <0.05) both in liver and muscle. In the liver there was a strong positive correlation between IGF2 exon 2 methylation and global DNA methylation (r = 0.7558). The mRNA expression levels of these growth-related genes were significantly different at starvation 14d (p <0.05), but did not have significant correlation with the methylation of these exons. The results implied that exon methylation of these growth-related genes might affect post-transcriptional process."
0,"We investigated the effect of chitooligosaccharides on the denaturation of weever (Lateolabrax japonicus) myofibrillar protein during frozen storage at -18 °C for 90 days. Chitooligosaccharides (2.5-10 g dry weight) were added to 100 g of myofibrillar protein, and the changes in the Ca-adenylpyrophosphatase (ATPase) activity, unfrozen water content, solubility, and sulfhydryl content of the myofibrillar protein were examined during frozen storage. We observed that the Ca-ATPase activity and solubility of the myofibrillar protein decreased gradually during frozen storage at -18 °C following the addition of chitooligosaccharides. In contrast, the Ca-ATPase activity and solubility of the myofibrillar protein of the control group decreased markedly during the first 45 days of storage and then further decreased gradually for up to 90 days of storage, indicating a biphasic denaturation pattern. The addition of chitooligosaccharides resulted in a significant increase in unfrozen water and sulfhydryl contents of the myofibrillar protein of the treatment group compared with that of the control group (p<0.05) during frozen storage at -18 °C."
0,"C-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), a subgroup of serine-threonine protein kinases that activated by phosphorylation, are involve in physiological and pathophysiological processes. JNK3 is one of JNK proteins involved in JNK3 signaling transduction. In the present study, two JNK3 isoforms, Ec-JNK3 X1 and Ec-JNK3 X2, were cloned from orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides. Both Ec-JNK3 X1 and Ec-JNK3 X2 were mainly expressed in liver, gill, skin, brain and muscle of juvenile grouper. The relative expression of Ec-JNK3 X2 mRNA was much higher in muscle and gill than that of Ec-JNK3 X1. Isoform-specific immune response to challenges was revealed by the expression profiles in vivo. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that JNK3 was localized in the cytoplasm of grouper spleen (GS) cells and shown immune response to SGIV infection in vitro. Over-expressing Ec-JNK3 X1 and/or Ec-JNK3 X2 inhibited the SGIV infection and replication and the SGIV-induced apoptosis. To achieve the antiviral and anti-apoptosis activities, JNK3 promoted the activation of genes ISRE and type I IFN in the antiviral IFN signaling pathway, and inhibited the activation of transcription factors NF-κB and p53 relating to apoptosis, respectively. Ec-JNK3 X2 showed stronger activities in antivirus and anti-apoptosis than that of Ec-JNK3 X1. Our results not only define the characterization of JNK3 but also reveal new immune functions and the molecular mechanisms of JNK3 on iridoviruses infection and the virus-induced apoptosis."
0,"Comprehensive in silico studies, based on the total fugu genome database, which was the first to appear in fish, revealed that torafugu Takifugu rubripes contains 20 sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MYH) genes (MYH genes) (Ikeda et al., 2007). The present study was undertaken to identify MYH genes that would be expressed in adult muscles. In total, seven MYH genes were found by screening cDNA clone libraries constructed from fast, slow and cardiac muscles. Three MYH genes, fast-type MYH(M86-1), slow-type MYH(M8248) and slow/cardiac-type MYH(M880), were cloned exclusively from fast, slow and cardiac muscles, respectively. Northern blot hybridization substantiated their specific expression, with the exception of MYH(M880). In contrast, transcripts of fast-type MYH(M2528-1) and MYH(M1034) were found in both fast and slow muscles as revealed by cDNA clone library and northern blot techniques. This result was supported by in situ hybridization analysis using specific RNA probes, where transcripts of fast-type MYH(M2528-1) were expressed in fast fibres with small diameters as well as in fibres of superficial slow muscle with large diameters adjacent to fast muscle. Transcripts of fast-type MYH(M86-1) were expressed in all fast fibres with different diameters, whereas transcripts of slow-type MYH(M8248) were restricted to fibres with small diameters located in a superficial part of slow muscle. Interestingly, histochemical analyses showed that fast fibres with small diameters and slow fibres with large diameters both contained acid-stable myofibrillar ATPase, suggesting that these fibres have similar functions, possibly in the generation of muscle fibres irrespective of their fibre types."
0,"A factorial, two-way, experimental design was used for this 10-week nutritional trial, aiming to elucidate the interactive effects of decreasing dietary protein:lipid level and substitution of fish oil (FO) with rapeseed oil (RO) on tissue fatty acid (FA) composition and metabolism of large Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) reared at high water temperatures (sub-optimal, summer temperatures: 11·6°C). The six experimental diets were isoenergetic and formulated to include either FO or RO (60 % of the added oil) at three dietary protein:lipid levels, specifically (1) 350 g/kg protein and 350 g/kg lipid, (2) 330 g/kg protein and 360 g/kg lipid, (3) 290 g/kg protein and 380 g/kg lipid. Final weight, specific growth rate and thermal growth coefficient were positively affected by the dietary RO inclusion at the expense of FO, while no significant effects were seen on growth due to the decreasing protein level. The oil source had a significant effect on muscle and liver FA composition. However, the changes in muscle and liver FA indicate selective utilisation or retention of individual FA and moderate reductions in tissue EPA and DHA. Pyloric caeca phospholipid FA composition was significantly affected by the two factors and, in some cases, significant interactions were also revealed. Liver and red muscle β-oxidation capacities were significantly increased due to RO inclusion, while an interactive effect of protein level and oil source was shown for white muscle β-oxidation capacity. The results could explain, at least partially, the better performance that was shown for the RO groups and the enhanced protein-sparing effect."
0,"Toxic cyanobacterial blooms, which produce cyclic heptapeptide toxins known as microcystins, are worldwide environmental problems. On the other hand, the cyanobacteria protein (30-50%) has been recommended as substitute protein for aquaculture. The present laboratory study verified the feasibility of cyanobacteria protein substitution and risk assessment. Goldfish were fed diets supplemented lyophilised cyanobacteria powder for 16 weeks with the various doses: 0% (control), 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. Low doses (10% and 20%) promoted growth whereas high doses (30% and 40%) inhibited growth. In cyanobacteria treated fish, the proximate composition of ash, crude fat content and crude protein content decreased in 16 weeks; the saturated fatty acid (SFA) content significantly increased; the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid content, collagen content and muscle pH significantly decreased; cooking loss percents increased significantly. Muscle fiber diameter and myofibril length were negatively correlation. Additionally, flavour compounds (e.g., amino acids, nucleotides, organic acids and carnosine) changed significantly in the treated fish, and odour compounds geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol increased significantly. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of microcystins in muscle was close to or exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) tolerable daily intake (TDI), representing a great health risk. Cyanobacterie is not feasible for protein sources use in aquaculture. "
0,"Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is the causative agent of pancreas disease (PD) in farmed Atlantic salmon. A previous study showed that vaccination of pre-smolt salmon with a plasmid encoding the structural polypeptide of SAV gave protection against infection and development of PD accompanied by production of antibodies against the virus. In the present work we analyzed transcript responses in the muscle to vaccination with this plasmid (here named pSAV). The purpose was to shed light on how pSAV might initiate adaptive immune responses in the fish. The work was based on microarray and reverse transcription quantitative PCR analyses of muscle at the injection site 7 days after vaccination. The results showed that pSAV and pcDNA3.3 had similar abilities to up-regulate type I IFN stimulated genes. In contrast, pSAV caused higher up-regulation of IFNγ and several IFNγ inducible genes. Compared to pcDNA3.3, pSAV also gave larger increase in transcripts of marker genes for B-cells, T-cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs), which suggest attraction and role of these cells in the adaptive immune responses elicited by pSAV. Moreover, pSAV caused a stronger up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL10 and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and TNFα, which may explain attraction of lymphocytes and APCs. The present work shows that the expression profile of genes resulting from vaccination with pSAV is different from the expression profiles obtained previously by vaccination of salmonids with DNA vaccines against infectious salmon anemia virus and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus."
0,"Although multiple nutrients have shown protective effects with regard to preserving muscle function, the recommended amount of dietary protein and other nutrients profile on older adults for maintenance of high muscle mass is still debatable. The aims of this paper were to: (1) identify dietary differences between older women with low and high relative skeletal muscle mass, and (2) identify the minimal dietary protein intake associated with high relative skeletal muscle mass and test the threshold ability to determine an association with skeletal muscle phenotypes. Older women (<i>n</i> = 281; 70 ± 7 years, 65 ± 14 kg), with both low and high relative skeletal muscle mass groups, completed a food questionnaire. Skeletal muscle mass, fat-free mass (FFM), biceps brachii thickness, <i>vastus lateralis</i> anatomical cross-sectional area (VL<sub>ACSA</sub>), handgrip strength (HGS), maximum elbow flexion torque (MVC<sub>EF</sub>), maximum knee extension torque (MVC<sub>KE</sub>), muscle quality (HGS/Body mass), and fat mass were measured. Older women with low relative skeletal muscle mass had a lower daily intake of protein, iodine, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), Vit E, manganese, milk, fish, nuts and seeds (<i>p</i> < 0.05) compared to women with high relative skeletal muscle mass. The minimum required dietary protein intake for high relative skeletal muscle mass was 1.17 g/kg body mass/day (g/kg/d) (sensitivity: 0.68; specificity: 0.62). Women consuming ≥1.17 g/kg/d had a lower BMI (B = -3.9, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and fat mass (B = -7.8, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and a higher muscle quality (B = 0.06, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The data indicate that to maintain muscle mass and function, older women should consume ≥1.17 g/kg/d dietary protein, through a varied diet including milk, fish and nuts that also contain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and micronutrients such as iodine, Vit E and manganese."
0,"Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in mammals is a member of the ancient Toll-like family of receptors that predominantly recognizes conserved components of Gram-positive bacteria. In the present study, a tlr2 gene and its 5'-flanking sequence were cloned from turbot, Scophthalmus maximus, its responsive expressions to various immunostimulants were subsequently studied in vivo. The turbot (sm)tlr2 gene spans over 9.0 kb with a structure of 12 exon-11 intron and encodes 816 amino acids. The deduced protein shows the highest sequence identity (76.1%) to Japanese flounder Tlr2 and possesses a signal peptide sequence, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain composed of 19 LRR motifs, a transmembrane region and a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. Phylogenetic analysis grouped it with other neoteleostei Tlr2as. A number of transcription factor binding sites known to be important for the basal transcriptional activity of TLR3 and response of TLR2 to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signalling in mammals were predicted in the 5'-flanking sequence of smtlr2. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis demonstrated the constitutive expression of smtlr2 mRNA in all twelve examined tissues with higher levels in the lymphomyeloid-rich tissues and liver. Further, smtlr2 expression was up-regulated following stimulation with LPS, peptidoglycan (PGN) or polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] in the gills, head kidney, spleen and muscle. Finally, for all three immunostimulants, a two-wave induced smtlr2 expression was observed in the head kidney and spleen in a 7-day time course and the strongest inducibility in the head kidney. These findings suggest a possible role of Smtlr2 in the immune responses to the infections of a broad range of pathogens that include Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and RNA virus."
0,"The typical calpain proteases are a subset of a wider superfamily and regulate a broad spectrum of physiological processes. Here we characterised Atlantic halibut complete-coding orthologues of calpain-1, calpain-2-like, ""muscle-specific"" calpain-3, plus calpain-11, a recently recognised vertebrate-wide family member. Phylogenetic analysis established the relationship of each sequence within a comprehensive framework of vertebrate calpains, including teleost paralogues. This approach provided significant insight into the evolution of teleost calpains. For example, teleost sequences considered calpain-2 orthologues formed a monophyletic clade external to sister clades for tetrapod calpain-2 and vertebrate calpain-8. Thus, teleost ""calpain-2"" is likely not directly orthologous to tetrapod calpain-2 and represents a calpain-2-like protein. The characteristic domain structure of typical calpains was observed in each halibut sequence, although calpain-3, as for other teleosts, retained only one (IS2) of three further domains found in human calpain-3 (NS, IS1 and IS2). Transcripts for capn1, capn2-like and capn11 were widely detected across eleven halibut tissues, whereas capn3 was detected in striated muscles, spleen and ovary, but absent or relatively less abundant in other tissues. We assessed the transcript expression of each calpain gene in fast-twitch skeletal muscle where nutritional state was altered with 60days feed restriction, followed by 60days satiation refeeding. Measured by quantitative real-time PCR, capn1 transcript levels were highest during maximal fasting and then steadily decreased with refeeding, where muscle was in net positive protein balance. Conversely capn2-like showed little response, whereas capn3 and capn11 transcript levels were lowest at maximal fasting before being strongly constitutively upregulated with subsequent refeeding. Halibut capn3 transcript abundance was on average 6.5, 23.7 and 5.9 fold greater than capn1, capn2-like and capn11 respectively in skeletal muscle across nutritional states. In turn, transcript levels of capn1 and capn11 were invariably higher than capn2-like, but were dependent on nutritional state compared to each other. The differential regulation of these genes in response to nutritional status suggests distinct roles for typical calpain family members in regulating the balance between catabolism and growth in teleost skeletal muscle."
0,"In this study, the cDNA encoding insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) was cloned from the liver of goldfish (Carassius auratus). The obtained goldfish IGFBP-1 cDNA sequence was 1037 bp in length and had an open reading frame of 789 bp encoding a predicted polypeptide of 262 amino acid residues. IGFBP-1 transcript was detected in all tested central nervous and peripheral tissues. The relatively higher levels of IGFBP-1 mRNA were observed in the liver, gill, kidney, heart, spleen, fat and testis, while the lower levels were found in all different regions of brain, muscle and intestine. In the skin, IGFBP-1 mRNA expression level was extremely low. The IGFBP-1 mRNA expression level in liver was significantly elevated after feeding. With cadmium exposure for 24 h, IGFBP-1 mRNA expression levels in spleen and liver were significantly increased at different cadmium concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 ppm. The results in this study provided the data regarding molecular characteristics and expression patterns of IGFBP-1 in goldfish and showed that the expression of IGFBP-1 mRNA might be associated with metabolic status and heavy metal stress and regulated by metabolic factors and cadmium in fish.

0,"The structural and evolutionary linkage between tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the globular C1q (gC1q) domain defines the C1q and TNF-related proteins (CTRPs), which are involved in diverse functions such as immune defense, inflammation, apoptosis, autoimmunity, and cell differentiation. In this study, red-lip mullet (Liza haematocheila) CTRP4-like (MuCTRP4-like), CTRP5 (MuCTRP5), CTRP6 (MuCTRP6), and CTRP7 (MuCTRP7) were identified from the red-lip mullet transcriptome database and molecularly characterized. According to in silico analysis, coding sequences of MuCTRP4-like, MuCTRP5, MuCTRP6, and MuCTRP7 consisted of 1128, 753, 729, and 888 bp open reading frames (ORF), respectively and encoded 375, 250, 242, and 295 amino acids, respectively. All CTRPs possessed a putative C1q domain. Additionally, MuCTRP5, MuCTRP6, and MuCTRP7 consisted of a collagen region. Phylogenetic analysis exemplified that MuCTRPs were distinctly clustered with the respective CTRP orthologs. Tissue-specific expression analysis demonstrated that MuCTRP4-like was mostly expressed in the blood and intestine. Moreover, MuCTRP6 was highly expressed in the blood, whereas MuCTRP5 and MuCTRP7 were predominantly expressed in the muscle and stomach, respectively. According to the temporal expression in blood, all MuCTRPs exhibited significant modulations in response to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and Lactococcus garvieae (L. garvieae). MuCTRP4-like, MuCTRP5, and MuCTRP6 showed significant upregulation in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The results of this study suggest the potential involvement of Mullet CTRPs in post-immune responses."
0,"The suitability of metallothioneins (MT) in fish as biomarker of exposure to mercury has been questioned. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the relationship between external levels of exposure, mercury accumulation and MT content, assessing species and tissue specificities. Two ecologically different fish species--Dicentrarchus labrax and Liza aurata--were surveyed in an estuary historically affected by mercury discharges. Total mercury (T-Hg) and MT content were determined in gills, blood, liver, kidney, muscle and brain. All tissues reflected differences in T-Hg accumulation in both species, although D. labrax accumulated higher levels. Regarding MT, D. labrax revealed a depletion in brain MT content and an incapacity to induce MT synthesis in all the other tissues, whereas L. aurata showed the ability to increase MT in liver and muscle. Tissue-specificities were exhibited in the MT inducing potential and in the susceptibility to MT decrease. L. aurata results presented muscle as the most responsive tissue. None of the investigated tissues displayed significant correlations between T-Hg and MT levels. Overall, the applicability of MT content in fish tissues as biomarker of exposure to mercury was uncertain, reporting limitations in reflecting the metal exposure levels and the subsequent accumulation extent."
0,"Tuna muscle consists of light and dark muscle in approximately equal proportions. However, besides for the light muscle of tuna, cod, sardine, and salmon, few researches have assessed the health-promoting functions of fish protein. Therefore, we evaluated the mechanisms underlying the alteration of lipid storage and cholesterol metabolism following the intake of tuna dark muscle protein (TDMP) by obese type-2 diabetic/obese mice. Four-week-old male KK-A<sup>y</sup> mice were separated into 2 dietary groups, with one group receiving a casein-based diet and the other receiving a diet with the substitution of part of the protein (50%, w/w) by TDMP (TDMP diet) for 4 wk. The TDMP diet significantly increased the content of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, partly due to the reduction of the expression of scavenger receptor class B member 1 in epididymal white adipose tissue. In addition, dietary TDMP decreased the content of hepatic triacylglycerol, which could be due to the enhancement of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-2 activity through the activation of the expression of the peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-α in the liver. These results suggest that TDMP could have the potential to prevent the development of obesity-related diseases by suppressing the storage of hepatic triacylglycerol and cholesterol."
0,"Perilipin family is the main structural proteins of lipid droplet (LD) that is intracellular neutral lipid store ponds, and regulates LD assembly and formation, and is crucial for lipid metabolism. Here three paralogs of perilipin family were characterized from grass carp and their complete coding sequences (CDS) were obtained, including perilipin1, perilipin2, and perilipin3, coding peptides of 492, 454, and 419 amino acids, respectively. The alignment of the homology of grass carp perilipin deduced amino acid sequences with other teleost species showed that the homology with mammalian was less than 55%. PAT (perilipin) domain in mammalian was also predicted in grass carp perilipin 1-3 proteins. Genomic organization analysis revealed that grass carp perilipin1 contained 6 coding exons, while both perilipin2 and perilipin3 consisted of 7 coding exons. The mRNA encoding three paralogs were expressed in a wide range of tissues; perilipin1-3 were primarily expressed in adipose tissue and liver; besides, perilipin3 was also highly expressed in the heart. In vitro, 200 μM DHA increased the proportion of smaller lipid droplets effectively in fully differentiated adipocytes of grass carp. The mRNA expression of perilipin1, perilipin2, and perilipin3 was significantly increased in the adipocytes treated with DHA (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The same responses of different paralogs in the adipocytes during DHA treatment suggest that they might play synergistic roles in the formation of LDs."
0,"Lead is toxic to fish, and its toxicity can be aggravated by the water temperature. Geophagus brasiliensis populations are geographically widespread and thus live in areas with different temperatures. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of lead-contaminated feed in fish (Geophagus brasiliensis) exposed to different temperatures. A factorial experiment was performed with two temperatures (25 and 28°C), and two feeds (control and lead contaminated - 60 mg/kg) for a sum of four treatments (25°C, Control = 25/C; 25°C, 60 mg/kg = 25/60; 28°C, Control = 28/C and 28°C, 60 mg/kg = 28/60). Analyses of the lead accumulation, oxidative stress and genotoxic damage were performed. The gills and liver showed increased lead concentrations in fish receiving lead-contaminated food at both temperatures. The lead concentrations in the intestines and muscles of fish exposed to the 25/60 treatment was greater than it was in fish exposed to the 25/C treatment. The enzyme response in the gills and the micronuclei count increased in fish exposed to the 25/60 treatment. Higher temperatures can be a beneficial factor for Geophagus brasiliensis because they can hinder the absorption of lead, thereby reducing the damage caused to the organism."
0,"To investigate the underlying mechanism of softening of ice-stored grass carp fillet, changes in assembly structure of myofibrillar proteins and potential candidates for regulating this change including myosin regulatory chain phosphorylation, heat shock proteins (Hsp27, Hsp90, αB-crystallin and UNC45) and endogenous protease activity were studied. Comparison of SDS-PAGE pattern of myofibrillar proteins treated with EDC crosslinking showed that thin filament experienced rapid disassembly within initial 8 h, followed by depolymerization of thick filament consisting of myosin, which further exacerbated the myofibril disorganization of fillets. Pearson coefficient analysis showed that UNC45, Hsp90, Hsp27 and αB-crystallin concentration and cathepsin B, D, L activities were significantly correlated with dissociated MHC and actin. Therefore, the significant correlation between shear force and dissociated MHC and actin clearly demonstrated that post mortem disassembly of myofibril filaments, which was regulated by endogenous proteolytic activity and loss of Hsp, contributed to the softening of ice-stored grass carp fillets."
0,"Two complementary (c)DNA fragments, including the complete open reading frame of fabp2 from the common carp Cyprinus carpio, were cloned by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Both were putative intestinal-type fabp genes, named fabp2a and fabp2b. fabp2b was mainly expressed in the intestine and the brain. This gene, however, was nearly not expressed in the liver, heart, pancreas and muscle. fabp2a was only expressed at a very low level in the intestine. Western blot also showed that Fabp2 is relatively highly expressed in the intestine and the brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Fabp2 is widely distributed in the mucosa of the intestine. These findings provide novel insights into the fabp2 gene molecular evolution, as well as its potential features in the intestine and the brain."
0,"Muscle wasting is estimated to affect 40-60% of alcoholics, and is more common than cirrhosis among chronic alcohol abusers. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying alcohol-related musculoskeletal dysfunction are, however, poorly understood. Muscle-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) referred to as myoMirs are now known to play a key role in both myogenesis and muscle atrophy. Yet, no studies have investigated a role for myoMirs in alcohol-related skeletal muscle damage. We developed a zebrafish model of chronic ethanol exposure to better define the mechanisms mediating alcohol-induced muscle atrophy. Adult fish maintained at 0.5% ethanol for eight weeks demonstrated significantly reduced muscle fiber cross-sectional area (∼12%, P < 0.05) compared to fish housed in normal water. Zebrafish miRNA microarray revealed marked changes in several miRNAs with ethanol treatment. Importantly, miR-140, a miRNA that shows 100% sequence homology with miR-140 from both mouse and human, is decreased 10-fold in ethanol treated fish. miR-140 targets several members of the Notch signaling pathway such as DNER, JAG1, and Hey1, and PCR data show that both Hey1 and Notch 1 are significantly up-related (3-fold) in muscle of ethanol treated fish. In addition, miR-146a, which targets the Notch antagonist Numb, is elevated in muscle from ethanol-treated fish. Upregulation of Notch signaling suppresses myogenesis and maintains muscle satellite cell quiescence. These data suggest that miRNAs targeting Notch are likely to play important roles in alcohol-related myopathy. Furthermore, zebrafish may serve as a useful model for better understanding the role of microRNAs in alcohol-related tissue damage."
0,"Nonspecific cytotoxic cells (NCCs) are an important cytotoxic cell population in the innate teleost immune system. The receptor designated ""NCC receptor protein 1"" (NCCRP-1) has been reported to be involved in the recognition and activation of NCCs. In this study, the full-length cDNA of Epinephelus coioides NCCRP-1 (ecnccrp-1) was cloned. The open reading frame (ORF) of ecnccrp-1 is 699 bp, encoding a 232 amino acid protein that includes proline-rich motifs at the N-terminus and is related to the F-box associated family. Although a bioinformatics analysis showed that EcNCCRP-1 had no signal peptide or transmembrane helices, a polyclonal antibody directed against recombinant EcNCCRP-1 efficiently labeled a membrane protein in the head kidney, detected with Western blot analysis, which indicated that the protein localized to the cell surface. RT-PCR showed that the constitutive expression of ecnccrp-1 was higher in the lymphoid organs, such as the trunk kidney, spleen, head kidney, and thymus, and lower in brain, heart, fat, liver, muscle, and skin. After infection with Cryptocaryon irritans, the transcription of ecnccrp-1 was analyzed at the infected sites (skin and gills) and in the systemic immune organs (head kidney and spleen). At the infected sites, especially the skin, ecnccrp-1 expression was upregulated at 6h post infection, reaching peak expression on day 3 post the primary infection. However, the expression patterns differed in the systemic immune organs. In the spleen, ecnccrp-1 was gradually increased in the early infection period and decreased sharply on day 3 post the primary infection, whereas in the head kidney, the transcription of ecnccrp-1 was depressed during almost the whole course of infection. An immunohistochemical analysis showed that EcNCCRP-1(+) cells accumulated at the sites of infection with C. irritans. These results suggested that NCCs were involved in the process of C. irritans infection in E. coioides."
0,"In this study, we isolated and characterized HSP70 cDNA from pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes). The 3053 bp full-length TrHSP70 sequence consisted of a 167 bp 5'-UTR (untranslated region), a 2535 bp open reading frame, and a 351 bp 3'-UTR. BLAST analysis revealed that the TrHSP70 shared high similarity with HSP70 sequences in other species. In our study, we set 3 experimental groups as H1 group (20 °C), H2 group (24 °C), and H3 group (28 °C) for checking the expression level of TrHSP70 in T. rubripes. Tissue-specific gene expression results showed that TrHSP70 had higher expression in the intestines than other tissues of the T. rubripes by RT-qPCR. In the experimental group, we found that the expression of TrHSP70 was upregulated in different tissues in the H3 group. The results show that TrHSP70 is a constitutively expressed gene, which plays an important role in maintaining normal physiological function and coping with stress."
0,"Deep-water fish are becoming an interesting object of studies and research due to the development of deep fishery activities. This paper analyses the chemical composition and nutritional value of the fish species Mora moro (Risso, 1810) inhabiting deep Mediterranean waters. The fatty acid profile and the principal water-soluble proteins present in the white muscle of this fish species have also been determined. The major fatty acids were 22 : 6n-3, 16 : 0, 18 : 1n-9, 20 : 4n-6 and 20 : 5n-3. The polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content was higher than that of saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids, but the ratio PUFA/SFA was lower than the value reported in other studies. Both the atherogenic index and thrombogenic index were very low. Water-soluble proteins were characterised by monodimensional native PAGE and 2-D SDS-gel electrophoresis. Protein patterns showed the presence of parvalbumins and of the principal myofibrillar proteins. Therefore, the deep-water fish M. moro could represent an interesting target for deep-sea fishery and commercial exploitation."
0,"Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) has been identified as a key transcriptional mediator regulating expression of both type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, the cDNA and genomic sequences of IRF5 were isolated from Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. The gene of Japanese flounder (Jf)IRF5 is 7326 bp long, contains 9 exons and 8 introns and encodes a putative protein of 472 amino acids. The predicted protein sequence shares 61.1-81.9% identity to fish IRF5 and possesses a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a middle region (MR), an IRF association domain (IAD), a virus activated domain (VAD) and two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) conserved in all known IRF5s. Phylogenetic analysis clustered it into the teleost IRF5 subgroup within vertebrate IRF5 group. JfIRF5 mRNA was constitutively expressed in all tissues examined, with higher levels observed in the gills and head kidney. Gene expression of JfIRF5 was analyzed over a 7-day time course in the gills, head kidney, spleen and muscle of Japanese flounders challenged with lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). The data showed that JfIRF5 expression was slightly up-regulated by LCDV, but its induction time was clearly moved up; in contrast, the induction upon poly I:C challenge started not earlier than day 2 post-injection and was stronger and more persistent with a later peak time in all four organs. The late and long-lasting inductive expression of JfIRF5 following poly I:C challenge suggests that it might be an interferon stimulated gene (ISG), the induction of which is driven by poly I:C-induced type I IFNs."
0,"Fish protein isolate were recovered from frozen small croaker using pH shift. The partial enzymatic hydrolysates were fractionated as soluble and insoluble parts. They were dried using the drum dryer and their functional properties were examined. The total nitrogen content of the enzymatic hydrolysates ranged from 12.9% to 13.7%. The degree of hydrolysis of precipitates was 18.2% and 12.2% for croaker hydrolysates treated with Protamex 1.5 MG (Bacilllus protease complex) and Flavourzyme 500 MG (endoproteases and exoproteases, Aspergillus oryzae), respectively. The TCA supernatant, after centrifugation of hydrolysates, contained numerous peptides ranging from 100 to 4000 daltons. The solubility of the supernatants was higher than that of the precipitates at 0% to 3% NaCl and pH 2 to 10. The precipitate of Flavourzyme- and Protamex-treated hydrolysates showed a high emulsion activity index value compared to egg white and bovine plasma protein. In addition, the highest emulsion stability was observed for Protamex-treated precipitate hydrolysates. Emulsion stability of Protamex-treated precipitate hydrolysates was comparable to those of protein additives (egg white, bovine plasma protein, and soy protein concentrate). Water and fat binding capacity of precipitates were higher than those of supernatant. The results indicate that precipitate hydrolysate from undersized croaker can be used in processed muscle foods as a functional and nutritional ingredient."
0,"Pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) is a Brazilian fish with a high economic value in pisciculture due to its rusticity and fast growth. Postnatal growth of skeletal muscle in fish occurs by hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy, processes that are dependent on the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts. A class of small noncoding RNAs, known as microRNAs (miRNAs), represses the expression of target mRNAs, and many studies have demonstrated that miR-1, miR-133, miR-206 and miR-499 regulate different processes in skeletal muscle through the mRNA silencing of hdac4 (histone deacetylase 4), srf (serum response factor), pax7 (paired box 7) and sox6 ((sex determining region Y)-box 6), respectively. The aim of our work was to evaluate the expression of these miRNAs and their putative target mRNAs in fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscle of pacu during growth. We used pacus in three different development stages: larval (aged 30 days), juvenile (aged 90 days and 150 days) and adult (aged 2 years). To complement our study, we also performed a pacu myoblast cell culture, which allowed us to investigate miRNA expression in the progression from myoblast proliferation to differentiation. Our results revealed an inverse correlation between the expression of the miRNAs and their target mRNAs, and there was evidence that miR-1 and miR-206 may regulate the differentiation of myoblasts, whereas miR-133 may regulate the proliferation of these cells. miR-499 was highly expressed in slow-twitch muscle, which suggests its involvement in the specification of the slow phenotype in muscle fibers. The expression of these miRNAs exhibited variations between different development stages and between distinct muscle twitch phenotypes. This work provides the first identification of miRNA expression profiles in pacu skeletal muscle and suggests an important role of these molecules in muscle growth and in the maintenance of the muscle phenotype.

0,"Fish is a rich source of proteins for humans and is widely consumed in various places in the world. This study assessed the levels of twenty trace metals (B, Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Ba, Hg and Pb) in fish feeds (n = 2), water (n = 27), and edible muscles of <i>Oreochromis mossambicus</i> (n = 20 from 8 ponds) from fish farms and Luvuvhu River (n = 3 from 1 river site) in Vhembe district of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Physicochemical parameters of water in the study area were analysed. Temperature ranged between 21.4-30.47 °C, pH: 5.59-7.28, electrical conductivity: 608-1216 μS/cm, total dissolved solids: 156-675 mg/l, dissolved oxygen: 0.28 - 0.56 mg/l, turbidity: 3.92-356.7 NTU, respectively. Levels of most trace metals such as Cr (2 μg/l and 1000 μg/kg), Mn (100 μg/l and 500 μg/kg), Fe (10 μg/l and 300 μg/kg), Ni (20 μg/l and 100 μg/kg), As (50 μg/l and 3 μg/kg), Pb (10 μg/l and 300 μg/kg) and Cu (2 μg/l and 2250 μg/kg) in water and <i>O. mossambicus</i> muscles were mostly below the World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)/WHO and European Commission (EC) recommended limit in the collected samples (Tshifulalani site and Duthuni site). However, Cu and Fe recorded concentration above the recommended limit at the control site (Luvuvhu River) in water and <i>O. mossambicus</i> muscles, respectively. Results from the bioaccumulation factor (BF), suggests the presence of metals in the water which can bioaccumulate in the fish muscles. Most of the metals (As, Cd, Hg, Mo, Sr, Sb and Sn) that recorded no possible bioaccumulation also recorded levels that complied with their maximum permissible limit (MPL) of WHO, FAO/WHO and EC guideline values in the fish feeds except for Se and Co. Moderate bioaccumulation was recorded for Cr, Mn, Fe and Zn in some of the sampling sites. Pb and Ni showed extreme bioaccumulation (BF > 5000) in one of the sampling sites and also recorded elevated levels in the fish feeds. Average daily dose (ADD), hazard quotient (HQ) and total hazard quotient (THQ) computed were less than 1. The Cancer risk (CR) evaluated were all below 10<sup>-4</sup> except in one site for children (Tshifulanani 2) but the overall average result showed no carcinogenic health risk to the consumers of the <i>O. mossambicus</i>. Therefore, <i>O. mossambicus</i> intake in the study area should be constantly monitored to prevent future health implications."
0,"The protein phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) is one of the most important serine/threonine phosphatases in eukaryotes. The holoenzyme of PP-2A consists of three subunits: a scaffold A subunit, a catalytic C subunit and a regulatory B subunit. While both A and C subunits are coded by two different genes, the B subunits exist in 26 or more isoforms which are encoded by at least 15 different genes. Previous studies have shown that besides regulating specific PP-2A activity, various B subunits may have other functions. To explore the possible roles of the regulatory subunits of PP-2A in vertebrate development, we have cloned the gene encoding goldfish striatin, a member of the B'"" family regulatory subunits for PP-2A, and determined their tissue-specific and temporal expression patterns."
1,The cDNA cloning was conducted with RT-PCR-based RACE. The mRNA expression levels for the goldfish striatin were analyzed with RT-PCR. The expression levels of the striatin protein from goldfish were determined with Western blot analysis. The semi-quantitation of the mRNA and protein expression levels was conducted with the software of U-scanning.
2,"Our study revealed that the full length cDNA for striatin consists of 2965 bp coding for a deduced protein of 769 amino acids, which bears a very high level of amino acid sequence identity with the homolog protein from other species. The striatin mRNA is highly expressed in the kidney, to a less degree in brain, fin, muscle, liver, ovary and gill, and the lowest in testis and heart. Similar pattern of protein expression is detected in the above 9 tissues. During the development of goldfish, the striatin mRNA maintains a relatively high level at the 2-cell, multiple cell and blastula stages. Then, it drops down substantially at gastrula stage and fluctuates around this level in the next 8 different stages. At the protein level, the striatin maintained higher level from 2-cell to gastrula stages, then decreased at neurula and optic vesicle stages, and gradually increased again to peak at eye pigmentation stage, then slightly decreased in the next few stages of development."
3,"Our results suggest that the striatin may play an important role in regulating goldfish development and adult tissue homeostasis. While the former function may or may not occur through PP- 2A functions, the later function appears to occur via PP-2A activity."
0,"The aim of this work is to underline the biological significance of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) in ectothermic fish using the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) as an experimental model. A contig of 1,990 bp in length was recognized as a UCP1 ortholog after initial searches in the gilthead sea bream AQUAFIRST database ( http://www.sigenae.org/aquafirst ). Additional searches were performed in skeletal muscle by RT-PCR, and the amplified PCR product was recognized as UCP3 after sequence completion by 5'- and 3'RACE. UCP1 expression was mostly detected in liver, whereas UCP3 transcripts were only found in skeletal and cardiac muscle fibres (white skeletal muscle > red skeletal muscle > heart). Specific gene regulation of UCP1 (liver) and UCP3 (white skeletal muscle) was addressed in physiological models of age, seasonal growth and energy-metabolic unbalances. Both the increase in energy demand (stress confinement) and the reduction in energy supply during adaptive cold response in winter down-regulated UCP1 expression. Conversely, transcript levels of UCP3 were higher with age, seasonal fattening and dietary deficiencies in essential fatty acids leading to the increase in fatty acid flux towards the muscle. This close association between UCP1 and UCP3 with the oxidative and metabolic tissue status is perhaps directly related to the ancestral protein UCP function, and allows the use of UCPs as lipotoxicity markers in ectothermic fish."
0,"Toll-like receptor 21 (TLR21) is a non-mammalian TLR recognizing unmethylated CpG DNA and considered as a functional homolog of mammalian TLR9. In the present study, a TLR21 gene was cloned from turbot, Scophthalmus maximus, its immune responsive expression was subsequently studied in vivo. The turbot (Sm)TLR21 gene is an intronless gene with a length of 3527 bp and encodes a peptide of 984 amino acids. The deduced protein possesses a signal peptide sequence, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain composed of 16 LRR motifs, a transmembrane (TM) region and a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. Phylogenetic analysis grouped it with other teleost TLR21s. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis demonstrated the constitutive expression of SmTLR21 mRNA in all twelve examined tissues with higher levels in the lymphomyeloid-rich tissues like spleen and head kidney. Further, upon stimulation with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], turbot reddish body iridovirus (TRBIV) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) 2395, the SmTLR21 mRNA expression was up-regulated in the gills, head kidney, spleen and muscle. The maximum increases of SmTLR21 transcript levels ranged from 1.3 to 8.1-fold and appeared at 3 h to 5 day post-injection depending on different organs and stimuli. These findings suggest that SmTLR21 may play an important role in the immune responses to the infections of a broad range of pathogens that include RNA and DNA viruses and bacteria."
0,"The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene Wt1 is highly conserved among vertebrates. In contrast to mammals, most fish species possess two wt1 paralogs that have been named wt1a and wt1b. Concerning wt1 in fish, most work so far has been done using zebrafish, focusing on the embryonic kidney, the pronephros. In this chapter we will describe the structure and development of the pronephros as well as the role that the wt1 genes play in the embryonic zebrafish kidney. We also discuss Wt1 target genes and describe the potential function of the Wt1 proteins in the adult kidney. Finally we will summarize data on the role of Wt1 outside of the kidney."
0,"The present study aimed to investigate the seasonal cellular stress response in vital organs, like the heart, the liver, the whole blood and the skeletal (red and white) muscles of the Mediterranean fish Sparus aurata during a 1-year acclimatization period in the field, in two examined depths (0-2 m and 10-12 m). Processes studied included heat shock protein expression and protein kinase activation. Molecular responses were addressed through the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90, the phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinases and particularly p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK-1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3). The induction of Hsp70 and Hsp90 and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, JNKs and ERKs in the examined five tissues of the gilthead sea bream indicated a cellular stress response under the prism of a seasonal pattern which was characterized by distinct tissue specificity. Specifically, Hsp induction and MAPK activation occurred before peak summer water temperatures, with no further increases in their levels despite increases in water temperatures. Moreover, although water temperature did not vary significantly with depth of immersion, significant effects of depth on cellular stress response were observed, probably caused by different light regime. The expression and the activation of these certain proteins can be used as tools to define the extreme thermal limits of the gilthead sea bream. "
0,"We have investigated whether mild heat shock, and resulting Hsp70 expression, can confer cross-protection against the stress associated with transfer from freshwater (FW) to seawater (SW) in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). In experimental Series I, juvenile trout reared in FW were transferred from 13.5 degrees C to 25.5 degrees C in FW, held for 2 h, returned to 13.5 degrees C for 12 h, and then transferred to 32 ppt SW at 13.5 degrees C. Branchial Hsp70 increased approximately 10-fold in the heat-shocked fish relative to the control by the end of recovery and remained high 2, 8, and 24 h post-salinity transfer. However, no clear differences could be detected in blood parameters (blood hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCHC, plasma Na(+) and plasma osmolarity) or muscle water content between heat-shocked and sham-shocked fish in SW at any sampling interval (0, 2, 8, 24, 48, 120, 240 and 360 h post-SW transfer). In experimental Series II, trout acclimated to 8 degrees C were heat-shocked at 22 degrees C for 2 h, allowed to recover 18 h, and exposed to a more severe salinity transfer (either 36 or 45 ppt) than in Series I. Branchial Hsp70 levels increased approximately 6-fold in heat-shocked fish, but had declined to baseline after 120 h in SW. Plasma osmolarity and chloride increased in both groups upon transfer to 36 ppt; however, the increase was significantly less in heat-shocked fish when compared to the increase observed in sham-shocked fish at 24 h. No significant differences could be detected in branchial Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity or Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1a and alpha1b mRNA expression between the two groups. Our data indicate that a mild temperature shock has only modest effects on the ability of rainbow trout to resist osmotic stress during FW to SW transfer."
0,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important class of molecules involved in non-specific immunity, and they are also the bridge connecting between non-specific immunity and specific immunity. As a vital member of TLR family TLR9 can be activated by bacterial DNA and induce the production of inflammatory cytokines. In this study, a full length of TLR9 homologue of 3677 bp in Nibea albiflora (named as NaTLR9, GenBank accession no: MN125017.1) was characterized, and its ORF was 3180 bp encoding 1059 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 121.334 kDa (pI = 6.29). Several leucine-rich repeated sequences (LRR domain) and conservative TIR domain were found in NaTLR9, which was mainly expressed in dendritic cells and macrophages. The phylogenetic and synteny analysis further revealed high sequence identity of NaTLR9 with its counterparts of other teleost, confirming their correct nomenclature and conservative during evolution as an important pattern recognition receptor. The NaTLR9-TIR-pEGFP-N1 fusion protein showed green fluorescence and mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. After co-transfection of NaTLR9-TIR-pEGFP-N1 and NaMyD88-pDsRED-Monomer-N1, green fluorescence obviously overlapped with red and changed into yellowish-green, which suggested that there might be the interaction between homologous NaTLR9-TIR and MyD88. Based on this result the pCDNA3.1-NaTLR9-TIR-flag and pcMV-NaMyD88-TIR-Myc plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells for the immunoprecipitation test. According to Western blot, TLR9 and MyD88 protein could interact with each other. Furthermore, NaTLR9 was ubiquitously expressed in all the investigated tissues, most abundantly in head kidney, followed by stomach, spleen, liver and gill, but lower in muscle. The vitro immune stimulation experiments revealed that Pseudomonas plecoglossicida and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] induced higher levels of NaTLR9 mRNA expression with the peaks of 9.52 times at 2 h and 39.91 times at 24 h compared with the control group respectively. The functional domains (LRRs and TIR, named NaTLR9-TIR and NaTLR9-LRR respectively) of NaTLR9 were expressed and purified, the recombinant proteins both could bind three kinds of typical aquatic pathogenic bacteria (Vibrio. parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Vibrio harveyi), which showed that NaTLR9 could couple to bacteria by its function domains. The aforementioned results indicated that NaTLR9 played a significant role in the defense against pathogenic bacteria infection in innate immune response of sciaenidae fish, which may provide some further understandings of the regulatory mechanisms in the teleostean innate immune system."
0,"The study evaluated the nutritional quality and investigated the heavy metals concentration in muscle tissues of five commercially important marine fish species, including brownspotted grouper (Epinephelus chlorostigma), squaretail coralgrouper (Plectropomus areolatus), black pomfret (Parastromateus niger), goldbanded jobfish (Pristipomoides multidens), and blueskin seabream (Polysteganus coeruleopunctatus) from the Red Sea, Jeddah Coast, Saudi Arabia. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in the proximate chemical composition of fish muscles in these species. The highest protein content (17.66 ± 0.58%) was achieved in blueskin seabream while the lowest (15.28 ± 0.46%) was observed in brownspotted grouper. The highest lipid content (2.97 ± 0.45%) was recorded in squaretail coralgrouper while the lowest (1.52 ± 0.26%) was observed in blueskin seabream. Heavy metal concentrations varied significantly within and between fish species under study (p < 0.05). Significant differences in the concentration of heavy metals among fish species were recorded. Results revealed that the bioaccumulation of Cr, Fe, Ni, and Cd in muscles of fish species under study was higher than the standard concentration, but that of Mn, Cu, and Pb were less than the standard concentration recommended in the EU, FAO, and WHO guidelines. In conclusion, these fish species represent a high-quality food source but is unsafe due to the level of certain minerals in their tissues. Results also indicated that the Red Sea environment is contaminated with heavy metals, which was reflected in the tissues of fishes used in this study."
0,"Amazon fish maintain oxygen uptake through a variety of strategies considered evolutionary and adaptive responses to the low water oxygen saturation, commonly found in Amazon waters. Oscar (Astronotus ocellatus) is among the most hypoxia-tolerant fish in Amazon, considering its intriguing anaerobic capacity and ability to depress oxidative metabolism. Previous studies in hypoxia-tolerant and non-tolerant fish have shown that hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) gene expression is positively regulated during low oxygen exposure, affecting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription and fish development or tolerance in different manners. However, whether similar isoforms exists in tolerant Amazon fish and whether they are affected similarly to others physiological responses to improve hypoxia tolerance remain unknown. Here we evaluate the hepatic HIF-1α and VEGF mRNA levels after 3 h of acute hypoxia exposure (0.5 mgO2/l) and 3 h of post-hypoxia recovery. Additionally, hematological parameters and oxidative enzyme activities of citrate synthase (CS) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were analyzed in muscle and liver tissues. Overall, three sets of responses were detected: (1) as expected, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, red blood cells, and blood glucose increased, improving oxygen carrying capacity and glycolysis potential; (2) oxidative enzymes from liver decreased, corroborating the tendency to a widespread metabolic suppression; and (3) HIF-1α and VEGF increased mRNA levels in liver, revealing their role in the oxygen homeostasis through, respectively, activation of target genes and vascularization. This is the first study to investigate a hypoxia-related transcription factor in a representative Amazon hypoxia-tolerant fish and suggests that HIF-1α and VEGF mRNA regulation have an important role in enhancing hypoxia tolerance in extreme tolerant species.

0,"Glucose transport across the plasma membrane is mediated by a family of glucose transporter proteins (GLUTs), several of which have been identified in mammalian, avian, and, more recently, in fish species. Here, we report on the cloning of a salmon GLUT from adipose tissue with a high sequence homology to mammalian GLUT4 that has been named okGLUT4. Kinetic analysis of glucose transport following expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes demonstrated a 7.6 +/- 1.4 mM K(m) for 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) transport measured under zero-trans conditions and 14.4 +/- 1.5 mM by equilibrium exchange of 3-O-methylglucose. Transport of 2-DG by okGLUT4-injected oocytes was stereospecific and was competed by D-glucose, D-mannose, and, to a lesser extent, D-galactose and D-fructose. In addition, 2-DG uptake was inhibited by cytochalasin B and ethylidene glucose. Moreover, insulin stimulated glucose uptake in Xenopus oocytes expressing okGLUT4 and in isolated trout adipocytes, which contain the native form of okGLUT4. Despite differences in protein motifs important for insulin-stimulated translocation of mammalian GLUT4, okGLUT4 was able to translocate to the plasma membrane from intracellular localization sites in response to insulin when expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These data demonstrate that okGLUT4 is a structural and functional fish homolog of mammalian GLUT4 but with a lower affinity for glucose, which could in part explain the lower ability of fish to clear a glucose load."
0,"With the expansion of the aquaculture industry in the last two decades, there has been a large increase in the use of plant ingredients in aquafeeds, which has created new challenges in fish growth, health and welfare. Fish muscle growth is an important trait that is strongly affected by diet, but our knowledge on the effect of plant protein-based diets on global gene expression in muscle is still scant. The present study evaluated nutrigenomic effects of the inclusion of proteins from pea, soy and wheat into aquafeeds, compared to a control diet with fishmeal as the main protein source using the zebrafish model by RNA-seq; these results were extended to an important aquaculture species by analyzing selected differentially expressed genes identified in the zebrafish model on on-growing Atlantic salmon fed with equivalent plant protein-based diets. Expression of selected Atlantic salmon paralogues of the zebrafish homologs was analyzed using paralogue-specific qPCR assays. Global gene expression changes in muscle of zebrafish fed with plant-based diets were moderate, with the highest changes observed in the soy diet-fed fish, and no change for the pea diet-fed fish compared to the control diet. Among the differentially expressed genes were <i>mylpfb</i>, <i>hsp90aa1.1</i>, <i>col2a1a</i>, and <i>odc1</i>, which are important in regulating muscle growth, maintaining muscle structure and function, and muscle tissue homeostasis. Furthermore, those genes and their paralogues were differentially expressed in Atlantic salmon fed with the equivalent percentage of soy or wheat protein containing diets. Some of these genes were similarly regulated in both species while others showed species-specific regulation. The present study expands our understanding on the molecular effects of plant ingredients in fish muscle. Ultimately, the knowledge gained would be of importance for the improved formulation of sustainable plant-based diets for the aquaculture industry."
0,"Contact between upper and lower posterior teeth is crucial for chewing. However, the influence of posterior occluding teeth loss on protein intake and muscle mass was unclear. This cross-sectional study compared consumption frequency of protein food, amount of protein and relevant micronutrient intakes and muscle mass indices among older adults with different Eichner indices (EI) of posterior occluding teeth loss. Ninety Thai healthy adults were divided into three groups (N=30 each) according EI with statistically comparable characters. Food frequency questionnaire, 4-days diet record, and bioelectrical impedance analysis were used for outcome measurement. Our findings suggested that loss of posterior occluding teeth on both sides was associated with less frequent consumption of meat, nut, egg, fish and dairy products, inadequate intakes of protein (< 0.8 g/kg body weight), iron and vitamin B12, and reduced muscle mass indices in older adults. Future large-scale cohort studies are warranted to confirm these findings."
0,"Beta-defensins (β-defensins) are small cationic amphiphilic peptides that are widely distributed in plants, insects, and vertebrates, and are important for their antimicrobial properties. In this study, the β-defensin (Onβ-defensin) gene of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was cloned from spleen tissue. Onβ-defensin has a genomic DNA sequence of 674 bp and produces a cDNA of 454 bp. Sequence alignments showed that Onβ-defensin contains three exons and two introns. Sequence analysis of the cDNA identified an open reading frame of 201 bp, encoding 66 amino acids. Bioinformatic analysis showed that Onβ-defensin encodes a cytoplasmic protein molecule containing a signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of this peptide contains six conserved cysteine residues and two conserved glycine residues, and shows 81.82% and 78.33% sequence similarities with β-defensin-1 of fugu (Takifugu rubripes) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), respectively. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the level of Onβ-defensin expression was highest in the skin (307.1-fold), followed by the spleen (77.3-fold), kidney (17.8-fold), and muscle (16.5-fold) compared to controls. By contrast, low levels of expression were found in the liver, heart, intestine, stomach, and gill (<3.0-fold). Artificial infection of tilapia with Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS] strain) resulted in a significantly upregulated expression of Onβ-defensin in the skin, muscle, kidney, and gill. In vitro antimicrobial experiments showed that a synthetic Onβ-defensin polypeptide had a certain degree of inhibitory effect on the growth of Escherichia coli DH5α and S. agalactiae. The results indicate that Onβ-defensin plays a role in immune responses that suppress or kill pathogens."
0,"Walking is the predominant locomotor behavior expressed by land-dwelling vertebrates, but it is unknown when the neural circuits that are essential for limb control first appeared. Certain fish species display walking-like behaviors, raising the possibility that the underlying circuitry originated in primitive marine vertebrates. We show that the neural substrates of bipedalism are present in the little skate Leucoraja erinacea, whose common ancestor with tetrapods existed ∼420 million years ago. Leucoraja exhibits core features of tetrapod locomotor gaits, including left-right alternation and reciprocal extension-flexion of the pelvic fins. Leucoraja also deploys a remarkably conserved Hox transcription factor-dependent program that is essential for selective innervation of fin/limb muscle. This network encodes peripheral connectivity modules that are distinct from those used in axial muscle-based swimming and has apparently been diminished in most modern fish. These findings indicate that the circuits that are essential for walking evolved through adaptation of a genetic regulatory network shared by all vertebrates with paired appendages. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
0,"The current study investigated whether sardine protein mitigates the adverse effects of fructose on plasma glucagon‑like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and oxidative stress in rats. Rats were fed casein (C) or sardine protein (S) with or without high‑fructose (HF) for 2 months. Plasma glucose, insulin, GLP‑1, lipid and protein oxidation and antioxidant enzymes were assayed. HF rats developed obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and oxidative stress despite reduced energy and food intakes. High plasma creatinine and uric acid levels, in addition to albuminuria were observed in the HF groups. The S‑HF diet reduced plasma glucose, insulin, creatinine, uric acid and homeostasis model assessment‑insulin resistance index levels, however increased GLP‑1 levels compared with the C‑HF diet. Hydroperoxides were reduced in the liver, kidney, heart and muscle of S‑HF fed rats compared with C‑HF fed rats. A reduction in liver, kidney and heart carbonyls was observed in S‑HF fed rats compared with C‑HF fed rats. Reduced levels of nitric oxide (NO) were detected in the liver, kidney and heart of the S‑HF fed rats compared with C‑HF fed rats. The S diet compared with the C diet reduced levels of liver hydroperoxides, heart carbonyls and kidney NO. The S‑HF diet compared with the C‑HF diet increased the levels of liver and kidney superoxide dismutase, liver and muscle catalase, liver, heart and muscle glutathione peroxidase and liver ascorbic acid. The S diet prevented and reversed insulin resistance and oxidative stress, and may have benefits in patients with metabolic syndrome."
0,"The warm temperature acclimation related 65 kDa protein-2 (Wap65-2), a teleost plasma glycoprotein, plays an important role in immune regulation against bacterial infection. Here, for the first time we determined the full length cDNA sequence of the Japanese sea bass Wap65-2 gene (1 601 bp in length excluding the 3'-polyA tail). The sequence contains an open reading frame that encodes a protein of 436 amino acids with a molecular weight of 4.87×10(4). The predicted protein had a signal peptide in the N-terminal domain containing 19 residues. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the Japanese sea bass Wap65-2 has a relatively high similarity to the Dicentrarchus labrax Wap65-2. In the healthy Japanese sea bass, Wap65-2 mRNA was expressed mainly in the liver and weakly in the heart and muscle. qRT-PCR results revealed that liver Wap65-2 transcripts were significantly increased after a Vibrio harveyi infection, and peaked 24 hour post injection (6.89 fold increase). The Japanese sea bass Wap65-2 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and subsequently used for antiserum preparation. Western blot analysis showed that Wap65-2 was significantly increased in V. harveyi infected Japanese sea bass and reached a maximum of 5.33-fold increase at 36 h. In conclusion, the alteration of Japanese sea bass Wap65-2 expression was tightly associated with the progression of the V. harveyi bacterial infection."
0,"Vertebrate skeletal muscles consist of heterogeneous tissues containing various types of muscle fibers, where specification of the fiber type is crucial for muscle development. Fish are an attractive experimental model to study the mechanisms of such fiber type specification because of the separated localization of slow and fast muscles in the trunk myotome. We examined regulation of expression of the torafugu gene of slow/cardiac-type myosin heavy chain, MYH <sub>M5</sub> , and isolated an operational promoter in order to force its tissue-specific expression across different fish species via the transgenic approach in zebrafish and medaka. This promoter activity was observed in adaxial cell-derived superficial slow muscle fibers under the control of a hedgehog signal. We also uncovered coordinated expression of MYH <sub>M5</sub> and Sox6b, which is an important transcriptional repressor for specification of muscle fiber types and participates in hedgehog signaling. Sequence comparison in the 5'-flanking region identified three conserved regions, CSR1-CSR3, between torafugu MYH <sub>M5</sub> and its zebrafish ortholog. Analysis of deletion mutants showed that CSR1 significantly stimulates gene expression in slow muscle fibers. In contrast, deletion of CSR3 resulted in ectopic expression of a reporter gene in fast muscle fibers. CSR3 was found to contain a putative Sox family protein-binding site. These results indicate that the dual mechanism causing inhibition in fast muscle fibers and activation in slow muscle fibers is essential for slow muscle fiber-specific gene expression in fish."
0,"E3 ubiquitin ligases are central for the selection of proteins targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. In this study atrogin-1 (Fbox-32), a major E3 ligase in muscle, has been characterized in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The protein sequence is highly conserved between teleosts and mammals and is characterized by the presence of five conserved motifs related to the identification of protein targets. The genomic structure is conserved between teleosts and mammals and contains 9 exon and 8 introns. The phylogenetic relationship between atrogin-1 and two other closely related ubiquitin E3 ligases FBXO25 and MuRF1 showed atrogin-1 and FBXO25 grouped together with MuRF1 being more distant. The mRNAs were expressed in multiple tissues, atrogin-1 and MuRF1 were most abundant in white muscle and heart whereas FBXO25 had greatest expression in brain, white muscle and heart. The transcriptional modulation of these E3 ligases was examined in starved fish and fish following different immune stimulations. Expression of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 was increased following food deprivation, implementing these two genes in degradation of muscle protein during starvation. During viral infection atrogin-1 expression was not altered, whereas it was increased following stimulation with LPS, indicating an onset of catabolic processes during inflammatory responses."
0,"Brevetoxins (PbTxs) and ciguatoxins (CTXs) are two suites of dinoflagellate derived marine polyether neurotoxins that target the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC). PbTxs are commonly responsible for massive fish kills and unusual mortalities in marine mammals. CTXs, more often noted for human intoxication, are suspected causes of fish and marine mammal intoxication, although this has never been reported in the field. VGSCs, present in the membrane of all excitable cells including those found in skeletal muscle, nervous and heart tissues, are found as isoforms with differential expression within species and tissues. To investigate the tissue and species susceptibility to these biotoxins, we determined the relative affinity of PbTx-2 and -3 and P-CTX-1 to native VGSCs in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle of rat and the marine teleost fish Centropristis striata by competitive binding in the presence of [(3)H]PbTx-3. No differences between rat and fish were observed in the binding of PbTxs and CTX to either brain or skeletal muscle. However, [(3)H]PbTx-3 showed substantial lower affinity to rat heart tissue while in the fish it bound with the same affinity to heart than to brain or skeletal muscle. These new insights into PbTxs and CTXs binding in fish and mammalian excitable tissues indicate a species related resistance of heart VGSC in the rat; yet, with comparable sensitivity between the species for brain and skeletal muscle."
0,"The influence of various freeze-thaw cycles on the physicochemical and histological properties of lightly salted tuna meat was studied. Enhanced water-holding capacity and springiness were obtained in the salted samples even after repeated freezing-thawing, which was ascribed to the modifications in tissue microstructure, ice crystal morphology, and protein properties. Intracellular and spherical ice crystals were observed in the salted meat, rather than the extracellular and large ice columns in the unsalted counterparts. Proteins in the salted meat were more sensitive to the stresses imposed by freezing-thawing and would form hydrophobic interactions more readily. Excessive freeze-thaw cycles accelerated the discoloration of salted meat, probably due to the decreased oxidative stability by salt. The overall quality properties of lightly salted tuna meat could be better maintained when subjected to no more than three freeze-thaw cycles."
0,"This paper is a part of a multi-disciplinary research ""Application of Decentralized On-Site Water Treatment System in Egypt for Use in Agriculture and Producing Safe Fish and Animal Proteins"". The project aimed to investigate the environmental impact of implementing sewage water before and after treatment using the effluent of the on-site decentralized Japanese' Johkasou system, in agriculture and producing fish protein. The aim is to establish such system in Egypt to strengthen the sanitary conditions of water resources. In the present study, the impact of the sewage pollution in some fish farms at El-Fayyum, Port Said and El-Dakahlia governorates in Egypt was carried out. Water and fish (Oreochromis niloticus and Mugil cephalus) samples were collected from private fish farms of such localities. Bacteriological and chemical examination of water samples revealed the existence of coliforms and many other bacterial species of significant human health hazards. The chemical parameters of water showed a marked deviation from normal levels while examination of fish flesh specimens indicated contamination with Streptococcus Sp., Staphylococcus Sp., and Salmonella in all examined localities. Other bacterial isolates of human health importance (Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas cepacia and Enterococcos durans) were identified. The parasitological examination revealed the presence of encysted metacercariae (EMC); Diplostomatidae, Prohemistomatidae and Heterphyidae. Moreover, two protozoan parasites (Mxyoboulus tilapiae and Ichthyophthirius multifilis) were also recorded. The histopathological examination revealed mild tissue reaction in case of bacterial infection and severe pathological lesions in different organs in case of EMC infection. Lamellar hyperplasia and mononuclear cell infiltration in branchial tissue was common findings. In skeletal muscles, atrophy of muscle fibres, myolysis and myophagia were detected."
0,"This report describes the alterations induced by an environmentally realistic concentration of cadmium in skeletal muscle fibre organization, composition, and function in the teleost zebrafish. Results demonstrate that the ion induces a significant quantitative and qualitative deterioration, disrupting sarcomeric pattern and altering glycoprotein composition. These events, together with a mitochondrial damage, result in a significant reduction in swimming performance. In conclusion, the evidence here collected indicate that in presence of an environmental cadmium contamination, important economic (yields in fisheries/aquaculture), consumer health (fish is an important source of proteins), and ecological (reduced fitness due to reduced swimming performance) consequences can be expected.

0,"Muscle foods, particularly fish products are highly exposed to oxidative stress during processing and storage, resulting in oxidative modification of proteins. Protein carbonyls content has been used as one of the measures of oxidative stress. Generally, the resulting carbonylated proteins (CPs) have so far been labeled with 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) hydrazine and detected with anti-DNP antibody. However, the applicability of this method to food samples is limited by its high price, time-consuming procedure and possibility to perform the measurements just on soluble protein fractions. We developed a simpler, faster and cheaper method to assess CP level in muscle foods, including both soluble and insoluble protein fractions, which is based on a direct reaction of protein carbonyls with 7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carbohydrazide (CHH). The paper describes a novel technique to label both soluble and insoluble carbonylated proteins with CHH and determine carbonyl content by fluorescence microscopy assay which correlates (R = 0.911) with conventional ELISA method."
0,"Mechanically-deboned cod muscle proteins were sequentially hydrolysed using pepsin and a trypsin+chymotrypsin combination, which was followed by passing the digest through a 1 kDa equipped tangential flow filtration system; the permeate (<1 kDa peptides) was collected as the cod protein hydrolysate (CPH). Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was used to separate the CPH into four peptide fractions (CF1-CF4) and their in vitro antioxidant properties investigated. Results showed that most of the peptide fractions (CF2-CF4) displayed significantly higher (p<0.05) oxygen radical absorbance capacity values (698-942 μM Trolox equivalents, TE/g) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging activities (17-32%) than those of CPH (613 μM TE/g and 19%, respectively). However, the unfractionated CPH displayed improved capability to scavenge superoxide and hydroxyl radicals as well as significantly higher (p<0.05) ferric iron reduction and chelation of iron than the RP-HPLC peptides. The CPH and peptide fractions displayed a dose-dependent inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation."
0,"This research aimed to assess the influence of dietary addition of rutin on inflammation, apoptosis and antioxidative responses in muscle of silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila). Fish were split into four groups as follows: control, 0.15% rutin, A. hydrophila, 0.15% rutin + A. hydrophila. After 2 weeks of feeding with standard or rutin diets, fish were challenged or not with A. hydrophila for 1 week. Rutin-added diet abrogates A. hydrophila induced-hemorrhage and inflammatory infiltration. It decreases A. hydrophila induced-apoptosis through decreasing the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 and increasing phospho-Akt to Akt ratio. It diminishes the A. hydrophila induced-rise in nitric oxide and superoxide anion levels and reestablishes superoxide dismutase activity as well. Although such diet is unable to recover the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), cysteine and glutamate cysteine ligase, which are depleted as a result of A. hydrophila infection, it diminishes the oxidized glutathione (GSSG) content, thus decreasing GSSG to GSH ratio. It increases the levels of cysteine residues of proteins and diminishes those of thiol-protein mixed disulfides, which were changed after A. hydrophila challenge. Finally, it reduces A. hydrophila induced-lipid peroxidation, markedly elevates ascorbic acid and thus reestablishes total antioxidant capacity, whose levels were decreased after A. hydrophila challenge. In conclusion, the dietary addition of rutin at 0.15% impairs A. hydrophila-induced inflammatory response, inhibits A. hydrophila-induced apoptosis and promotes cell survival. It also reduces the A. hydrophila-induced oxidative stress and stimulates the antioxidative responses in muscle of A. hydrophila-infected silver catfish."
0,"The lectin pathway of the complement system is characterized by two groups of soluble pattern recognition molecules, mannose-binding lectins (MBLs) and ficolins. These molecules recognize and bind carbohydrates in pathogens and activate complement leading to opsonization, leukocyte activation, and direct pathogen killing. While MBLs have been reported in many fish species, ficolins do not appear to be present in the teleost lineage, despite their importance in invertebrate and higher vertebrate innate immunity. A protein with a similar fibrinogen-like domain, microfibrillar-associated protein 4, MFAP4, is present in fish, albeit with no described immune function. We examined whether MFAP4 genes in fish may potentially act as pathogen receptors in the absence of ficolin. We isolated and characterized five MFAP4 genes from channel catfish. Linkage mapping and phylogenetic analysis indicated that at least three of the catfish MFAP4 genes are tightly clustered on a single chromosome, suggesting that they may have arisen through tandem duplication. Divergent, duplicated families of MFAP4 genes are also present in other teleost species. Expression analysis of the catfish MFAP4 transcripts revealed unique patterns of homeostatic expression among the genes in gill, spleen, skin, liver, and muscle. Expression of the five MFAP4 transcripts showed significant changes in expression as soon as 4h after infection with either Edwardsiella ictaluri or Flavobacterium columnare with modulation of expression continuing up to 7 d following pathogen exposure. Several different tissues and gene-specific patterns were captured and transcript expression changes of >30-fold were observed over the course of the bacterial challenges. Our results suggest a novel role for MFAP4 in teleost immune responses."
0,"Ectotherms often respond to prolonged cold exposure by increasing mitochondrial capacity via elevated mitochondrial volume density [V <sub>V</sub>(mit,f)]. In fish, higher V <sub>V</sub>(mit,f) is typically associated with increased expression of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1), a transcription factor that induces expression of nuclear-encoded respiratory genes. To examine if nrf1 expression or the expression of other genes that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis contribute to changes in whole-organism metabolic rate during cold acclimation, we examined the time course of changes in the expression of these genes and in metabolic rate in Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Cold acclimation rapidly decreased metabolic rate, but increased the expression of nrf1 more gradually, with a time course that depended on how rapidly the fish were transitioned to low temperature. Cold-induced nrf1 expression was not associated with increases in biochemical indicators of mitochondrial respiratory capacity, suggesting that cold-induced mitochondrial biogenesis may occur without increases in oxidative capacity in this species. These observations imply that changes in nrf1 expression and metabolic rate due to cold acclimation occur through different physiological mechanisms, and that increases in V <sub>V</sub>(mit,f) are likely not directly related to changes in metabolic rate with cold acclimation in this species. However, nrf1 expression differed between northern and southern killifish subspecies regardless of acclimation temperature, consistent with observed differences in metabolic rate and V <sub>V</sub>(mit,f) at 5 °C between these subspecies. Taken together, these results reveal substantial complexity in the regulation of V <sub>V</sub>(mit,f) and mitochondrial capacity with temperature in fish and the relationship of these parameters to metabolic rate."
0,"In order to study the protein dynamics in the tissues of fish we have developed a proteomics-based strategy to determine the rates of synthesis and degradation of individual proteins. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by measuring the turnover of multiple isoforms of parvalbumin (β1-7) in the skeletal muscle of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). A stable isotope-labelled amino acid ([(2)H(7)] l-leucine) was administered to the carp via the diet and its incorporation into the isoforms of parvalbumin in muscle over time was monitored by LC-MS analysis of signature peptides. The relative isotope abundance was calculated and used to deconvolute the data. The β7 parvalbumin isoform had a rate of synthesis that was greater than the rate of degradation. In contrast the rate of degradation of the β5 isoform exceeded its rate of synthesis, whilst the analysis revealed that the other parvalbumin β-isoforms (β1, β2, β3, β4 and β6) had a rate of synthesis that was equal to the rate of degradation. This work has addressed a number of technical challenges and represents the first study to use proteomic approaches to measure the turnover of individual proteins in fish."
0,"Antioxidant defense system (ADS) and oxidative stress parameters were evaluated in the Antarctic fish Notothenia rossii and N. coriiceps exposed to increasing temperature. Acclimated fish were kept at 0°C or exposed to 4°C for 1day (N. rossii) or to 2 and 4°C for 1 and 6 days (N. coriiceps). Measurements were assessed in brain, gills, liver, white muscle and erythrocytes. Parameters analyzed included antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP); reduced glutathione (GSH) and metallothionein-like proteins (MTLP) concentration; superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) activity; lipid peroxidation (LPO) level and protein carbonyl (PC) concentration. Increased liver GST activity was observed in N. rossii exposed to 4°C for 1day. Increased muscle GPx activity was observed in N. coriiceps after exposure to 2°C for 1day. Reduced gill GPx activity and increased liver SOD activity were observed after exposure to 4°C for 1day. In N. coriiceps, increased gill GCL activity and reduced gill GPx activity, as well as reduced liver MTLP were observed after exposure to 2°C for 6 days. Reduced brain SOD activity and increased brain LPO; reduced gill ACAP, GSH concentration and GPx activity, as well as increased gill GCL activity; reduced liver ACAP, MTLP, SOD activity, GST activity and increased liver and erythrocytes LPO were observed after exposure to 4°C for 6 days. These findings indicate that ADS is more responsive to short-term increasing temperature in the sluggish N. coriiceps than in the active N. rossii. However, responses of N. coriiceps to long-term increasing temperature were transient and did not prevent tissue oxidative damage. Considering the predicted increase in temperature in the Southern Ocean over the next decades, our findings suggest that Antarctic fishes are sensitive to ocean warming, displaying tissue oxidative damage associated with the thermal stress."
0,"This study investigated the muscle quality of the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei fed on a diet containing different proportions of mealworm meal (MW) (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%) as a substitute for fishmeal, which is the normal diet used in shrimp commercial production. The proximate composition, fatty acid profile, colour and texture of the shrimps were evaluated. Moisture, protein, and ash content of shrimp muscle were not significantly altered when fishmeal was replaced by MW (p>0.05). However, the replacement resulted in a linear increase in lipid content (p<0.05). The fatty acid composition of the experimental diets directly mirrored the fatty acid composition of shrimp muscle. The absence of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in MW composition resulted in a linear decrease in eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids in shrimp muscle with increasing levels of MW in the diet. The n-3/n-6 ratio ranged from 0.50 to 0.67. Colour and firmness were unchanged between the treatments. Although the use of MW as a fishmeal substitute in L. vannamei diets has affected the lipid and fatty acid composition of shrimp muscle, from a human nutritional perspective, the lipid content of the shrimps is considered low and the n-3/n-6 ratio remained within the human dietary requirements. Therefore the use of a mealworm diet for shrimp production is a viable alternative to increasingly expensive fishmeal based diets."
0,"Molecular cloning, characterization, and functional analysis of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) in female turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) were evaluated. Results showed that the full-length FSHR cDNA was 3824 bp long and contained a 2202 bp open reading frame that encoded a mature protein of 733 amino acids (aa) and a signal peptide of 18 aa. Multiple sequence analyses showed that turbot FSHR has high homology with the corresponding genes of other teleosts and significant homology with that of Hippoglossus hippoglossus. Turbot FSHR has the typical structural architecture of glycoprotein hormone receptors consisting of a large N-terminal extracellular domain, seven transmembrane domains and short C-terminal intracellular domain. FSHR mRNA was found to be abundant in the ovaries, but deficient in eyes, intestine, brain, muscle, gills, spleen, stomach, heart and kidney. Furthermore, FSHR mRNA was found to increase gradually from pre-vitellogenesis to migratory nucleus stages, with the highest values observed during the late vitellogenesis stage of the reproductive cycle. However, FSHR mRNA was found to decrease dramatically during the atresia stage. Meanwhile, functional analysis with HEK293T cells continual expressing FSHR demonstrated that FSHR was specifically stimulated by ovine FSH, but not ovine LH. These results indicate that turbot FSHR is mainly involved in the stimulation of vitellogenesis, regulation of oocyte maturation as well as promotion of ovarian development via specific ligand binding. These findings open doors to further investigation of physiological functions of FSHR, which will be valuable for fish reproduction and broodstock management."
0,"Marine fish species are an important source of biologically valuable proteins, fats, fat-soluble vitamins, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but they are also susceptible to pollutants. Mercury is liable to bioamplify in the aquatic food chain, and the health risks posed by methylmercury (MeHg) could undermine the benefits of eating fish, so risk-benefit assessments are needed for those fish species regularly consumed. The purpose of this study was to analyze the concentrations of mercury and characteristics of fatty acids in marine fish harvested from Liaodong Gulf, China, so as to better understand the risk-benefit effects of marine fish consumption. We found that the ratio of MeHg to total Hg (THg) was normally distributed. The concentrations of THg and MeHg in marine fish muscles (14 species, a total of 239) ranged from 0.920 to 0.288 μg/g and 0.050 to 0.192 μg/g, respectively. There were no significant interannual differences in the muscles' concentrations of MeHg and THg, or of their fatty acids (p > 0.05). The proportion of total saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) varied significantly among different marine fish-feeding habits (predacious, omnivorous, benthivorous and planktivorous), but the differences between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were not significant, which may be due to the undistinguished fatty acids (p < 0.05). The risk-benefit assessment using the intelligence quotient (IQ) scoring model revealed that all the studied marine fish had positive effects on child IQ under different consumption scenarios. Additionally, the integrated risk-benefit analysis for adult cardiovascular health showed that all the studied marine fish, but especially Ditrema temmincki Bleeker, are capable of reducing the relative cardiovascular risk posed by the MeHg in the fish. We conclude the positive effects of eating common marine fish from the Liaodong Gulf far outweigh their negative ones."
0,"In the present study, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is investigated as a method to measure connective tissue components that are important for the quality of Atlantic cod filets (Gadus morhua L.). The Atlantic cod used in this study originated from a feeding trial, which found that fish fed a high starch diet contained relative more collagen type I, while fish fed a low starch (LS) diet contained relative more glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the connective tissue. FTIR spectra of pure commercial collagen type I and GAGs were acquired to identify spectral markers and compare them with FTIR spectra and images from connective tissue. Using principal component analysis, high and LS diets were separated due to collagen type I in the spectral region 1800 to 800 cm<sup>-1</sup> . The spatial distribution of collagen type I and GAGs were further investigated by FTIR imaging in combination with immunohistochemistry. Pixel-wise correlation images were calculated between preprocessed connective tissue images and preprocessed pure components spectra of collagen type I and GAGs, respectively. For collagen, the FTIR images reveal a collagen distribution that closely resembles the collagen distribution as imaged by immunohistochemistry. For GAGs, the concentration is very low. Still, the FTIR images detect the most GAGs rich regions."

When mince and W-MR-Al were hydrolysed using Alcalase for up to 120 min, a higher degree of hydrolysis (DH) was found in W-MR-Al after 30 min of hydrolysis. Furthermore, hydrolysate from W-MR-Al had lower peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and non-haem iron content throughout hydrolysis period (P<0.05). When hydrolysate powder produced from mince and W-MR-Al (0-0.3%w/v) were fortified in milk, the former resulted in the lower likeness score (P<0.05) at all levels used. The addition of the latter, for up to 0.2%, had no effect on likeness of all attributes, compared with milk without fortification (P>0.05). Therefore, the appropriate pretreatment of mince yielded hydrolysate with lower fishy odour."
0,"In amniotes, limb muscle precursors de-epithelialize from the ventral dermomyotome and individually migrate into limb buds. In catsharks, Scyliorhinus, fin muscle precursors are also derived from the ventral dermomyotome, but shortly after de-epithelialization, they reaggregate within the pectoral fin bud and differentiate into fin muscles. Delamination of muscle precursors has been suggested to be controlled by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its tyrosine kinase receptor (MET) in amniotes. Here, we explore the possibility that HGF/MET signaling regulates the delamination of appendicular muscle precursors in embryos of the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula. Our analysis reveals that Hgf is expressed in pectoral fin buds, whereas c-Met expression in fin muscle precursors is rapidly downregulated. We propose that alteration of the duration of c-Met expression in appendicular muscle precursors might underlie the evolution of individually migrating muscle precursors, which leads to the emergence of complex appendicular muscular systems in amniotes."
0,"Fish myocytes continue to develop active tension when stretched to sarcomere lengths (SLs) on the descending limb of the mammalian length-tension relationship. A greater length-dependent activation in fish than mammals could account for this because the increase in Ca(2+) sensitivity may overcome the tendency for force to fall due to reduced cross-bridge availability at SLs above optimal myofilament overlap. We stretched skinned fish and rat ventricular myocytes over a wide range of SLs, including those on the descending limb of the mammalian length-tension relationship. We found that fish myocytes developed greater active tension than rat myocytes at physiological Ca(2+) concentrations at long SLs as a result of a higher Ca(2+) sensitivity and a steeper relationship between Ca(2+) sensitivity and SL. We also investigated the diastolic properties of fish and rat myocytes at long SLs by measuring titin-based passive tension, titin isoform expression and titin phosphorylation. Fish myocytes produced higher titin-based passive tension despite expressing a higher proportion of a long N2BA-like isoform (38.0+/-2% of total vs 0% in rat). However, titin phosphorylation in fish myocytes was lower than in rat, which may explain some of the difference in passive tension between species. The high level of titin-based passive tension and the differential phosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins in fish myocytes may contribute to the enhanced length-dependent activation and underlie the extended range of in vivo stroke volumes found in fish compared with mammals."
0,"DNA vaccines encoding the viral glycoproteins of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) have proved highly efficient in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) under experimental conditions. Non-specific as well as specific immune mechanisms seem to be activated. Temperature is an important external parameter affecting the immune response in fish. The present study aimed at determining the effectiveness of a DNA vaccine against VHS at different temperatures. Rainbow trout fingerlings acclimated at 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C or 15 degrees C, were given an intramuscular injection of 1 microg purified plasmid DNA and challenged with virulent VHSV 8 or 36-40 days later. The vaccine protected the fish well at all three temperatures, but the involvement of innate and adaptive mechanisms differed: at low temperature, non-specific protection lasted longer and at 36 dpv fish kept at 5 degrees C had no detectable response of neutralizing antibodies while 67% of the fish kept at 15 degrees C had seroconverted. Induction of Mx as measured in liver samples was delayed at 5 degrees C with no detectable response 7 dpv whereas fish maintained at 10 degrees C had significantly elevated levels of Mx3-transcripts at that time point. Immunohistochemical studies of the injection site of vaccinated fish also showed a clear effect of temperature: in fish maintained at 15 degrees C the vhsG-protein appeared earlier on the surface of transfected myocytes and the inflammatory response clearing away these myocytes arose earlier compared to fish kept at the lower temperatures of 5 and 10 degrees C."
0,"The marine carnivore yellowtail kingfish (YTK, Seriola lalandi) was fed diets containing 5% residual fish oil (from the dietary fish meal) plus either 20% fish oil (FO), 20% canola oil (CO), 20% poultry oil (PO), 10% fish oil plus 10% canola oil (FO/CO) or 10% fish oil plus 10% poultry oil (FO/PO) and the effects on fish growth and hepatic expression of two glutathione peroxidase (GPx 1 and GPx 4) and two peroxiredoxin (Prx 1 and Prx 4) antioxidant genes were investigated. Partial (50%) replacement of the added dietary fish oil with poultry oil significantly improved fish growth whereas 100% replacement with canola oil significantly depressed fish growth. The fatty acid profiles of the fish fillets generally reflected those of the dietary oils except that there was apparent selective utilization of palmitic acid (16:0) and oleic acid (18:1n-9) and apparent selective retention of eicospentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3). The Prx 1 and 4 genes were expressed at 10- and 100-fold the level of the GPx 4 and 1 genes, respectively, and at one-tenth the level of the highly expressed β-actin reference gene. Dietary fish oil replacement with canola oil significantly up-regulated GPx 1 gene expression and there was a non-significant tendency towards down-regulation of Prx 1 and Prx 4. The results are discussed in terms of the effects of fish oil replacement on the peroxidation index of the diets and the resulting effects on the target antioxidant enzymes."
0,"Predicting responses of marine organisms to global change requires eco-physiological assessments across the complex life cycles of species. Here, we experimentally tested the vulnerability of a demersal temperate fish (Sparus aurata) to long-lasting heatwaves, on larval, juvenile and adult life-stages. Fish were exposed to simulated coastal (18 °C), estuarine (24 °C) summer temperatures, and heatwave conditions (30 °C) and their physiological responses were assessed based on cellular stress response biomarkers (heat shock protein 70 kDa, ubiquitin, antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation) and phenotypic measures (histopathology, condition and mortality). Life-stage vulnerability can be ranked as larvae > adults > juveniles, based on mortality, tissue pathology and the capacity to employ cellular stress responses, reflecting the different environmental niches of each life stage. While larvae lacked acclimation capacity, which resulted in damage to tissues and elevated mortality, juveniles coped well with elevated temperature. The rapid induction of cytoprotective proteins maintained the integrity of vital organs in juveniles, suggesting adaptive phenotypic plasticity in coastal and estuarine waters. Adults displayed lower plasticity to heatwaves as they transition to deeper habitats for maturation, showing tissue damage in brain, liver and muscle. Life cycle closure of sea breams in coastal habitats will therefore be determined by larval and adult stages."
0,"In this study, the full-length complementary (c)DNA of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 gene (irak1) was cloned from common carp Cyprinus carpio. The complete open reading frame of irak1 contained 2109 bp encoding a protein of 702 amino acid residues that comprised a death domain, a ProST region, a serine-threonine-specific protein kinase catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain. The amino-acid sequence of C. carpio Irak1 protein shared sequence homology with grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idellus (84.5%). The phylogenetic tree of IRAKs separated the polypeptides into four clades, comprising IRAK1s, IRAK2s, IRAK3s and IRAK4s. Cyprinus carpio Irak1 fell into the cluster with previously reported IRAK1s including teleost Irak1s. The irak1 gene was highly expressed in gills, followed by brain, skin, hindgut, buccal epithelium, spleen, foregut, head kidney and liver, and was expressed at lowest levels in gonad and muscle. The irak1 messenger (m)RNA expression was up-regulated in liver, spleen, head kidney, foregut, hindgut, gills and skin after stimulation with Vibrio anguillarum and poly(I:C), and significantly high up-regulated expression was observed in liver and spleen. These results implied that irak1 might participate in antibacterial and antiviral innate immunity. These findings gave the indications that irak1 may participate in antibacterial and antiviral immunity."
0,"Mammalian studies report that methionine restriction (MR) as a dietary regimen extends life span, delays the onset of age-related diseases and enhances fat oxidation in obese subjects with metabolic syndromes. However, the underlying cellular signalling pathways are poorly understood. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a glucose-intolerant species, providing an excellent model for the study of carbohydrate metabolism. MR diets in combination with 12 % (+/-) and 22 % (+/-) carbohydrate-rich meals were fed to rainbow trout for a period of 8 weeks and phenotypic and transcript expression changes in the liver and white muscle were assessed. Fish fed MR diets, irrespective of carbohydrate load, were shown to abolish the glucose-intolerant phenotype 6 h post-feeding. There was a distinct switch in glucose and glycogen content in the liver of fish fed MR diets, with a significantly higher concentration of glycogen, suggesting reduced glycolytic capacity. Transcriptional responses to MR demonstrated decreased expression of hepatic fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory binding protein 1, PPARγ coactivator 1-α and PPARα, indicative of a reduction in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, and a potential decrease in hepatic fat oxidative capacity. Muscle adenylate charge was depressed under MR, and increased expression of AMP-activated protein kinase α1 was detected, indicative of reduced energy availability. Total DNA methylation showed that carbohydrate load, rather than MR, dictated hypomethylation of genomic DNA. This is the first study which demonstrates that MR can abolish a glucose-intolerant phenotype in trout, and identifies trout as a suitable model for studying metabolic syndromes."
0,"Torafugu myosin heavy chain gene, MYH<sub>M2528-1</sub>, is specifically expressed in neonatal slow and fast muscle fibers, suggesting its functional role in indeterminate muscle growth in fish. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of MYH<sub>M2528-1</sub> involved in indeterminate muscle growth in fish remained unknown. We previously isolated a 2100 bp 5'- flanking sequence of torafugu MYH<sub>M2528-1</sub> that showed sufficient promoter activity to allow specific gene expression in neonatal muscle fibers of zebrafish. Here, we examined the cis-regulatory mechanism of 2100 bp 5'-flanking region of torafugu MYH<sub>M2528-1</sub> using deletion-mutation analysis in zebrafish embryo. We discovered that myoblast determining factor (MyoD) binding elements play a key role and participate in the transcriptional regulation of MYH<sub>M2528-1</sub> expression in zebrafish embryos. We further discovered that paired box protein (Pax3) are required for promoting MYH<sub>M2528-1</sub> expression and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) binding sites participate in the transcriptional regulation of MYH<sub>M2528-1</sub> expression in slow/fast skeletal muscles. Our study also confirmed that the nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) binding sites take part in the transcriptional regulation of MYH<sub>M2528-1</sub> expression in slow and fast muscles fiber in relation to indeterminate muscle growth. These results obviously confirmed that multiple cis-elements in the 5'-flanking region of MYH<sub>M2528-1</sub> function in the transcriptional regulation of its expression."
0,"The influence of increasing temperatures in thermal and oxidative stress responses were studied in the muscle of several estuarine fish species (Diplodus vulgaris, Diplodus sargus, Dicentrarchus labrax, Gobius niger and Liza ramada). Selected fish were collected in July at the Tagus estuary (24±0.9°C; salinity of 30±4‰; pH=8). Fish were subjected to a temperature increase of 1°C.h(-1) until they reached their Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax), starting at 24°C (control temperature). Muscle samples were collected during the trial and results showed that oxidative stress biomarkers are highly sensitive to temperature. Results from stress oxidative enzymes show alterations with increasing temperature in all tested species. Catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6) activity significantly increased in L. ramada, D. labrax and decreased in D. vulgaris. Glutathione S-transferase (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) activity increased in L. ramada, D. sargus, D. vulgaris, and D. labrax. In G. niger it showed a cycle of increase-decrease. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) increased in L. ramada, D. sargus and D. labrax. With respect to correlation analysis (Pearson; Spearman r), the results showed that oxidation products and antioxidant defenses were correlated in L. ramada (LPO-CAT and LPO-GST, D. sargus (LPO-CAT), and D. labrax (LPO-CAT). Oxidative biomarkers were correlated with thermal stress biomarker (Hsp70) in L. ramada (CAT-Hsp70), D. vulgaris (LPO-Hsp70), D. labrax (GST-Hsp70) and G. niger (LPO-Hsp70). In conclusion, oxidative stress does occur with increasing temperatures and there seems to be a relation between thermal stress response and oxidative stress response. The results suggest that oxidative stress biomarkers should be applied with caution, particularly in field multi-species/multi-environment studies. "
0,"In the present work, we provide insight into electrostatic interactions and phase behaviors in mixtures of myofibrillar protein (MP) and κ-carrageenan (KC) of various pHs (8.0-3.0) and biopolymer weight ratios [R, from 1:1 to 20:1; total concentration=0.05% (w/w)] through turbidimetric analysis, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential analysis, and optical microscopy. At R=1: 1, critical pH values (i.e., pH<sub>c</sub>, pH<sub>Φ1</sub>, and pH<sub>Φ2</sub>), which indicate phase transitions interrelated to the formation of soluble or insoluble MP-KC complexes, were observed at pH7.6, 6.8, and 3.6, respectively. As the ratio increased, the pH<sub>max</sub> shifted from 4.9 to 5.8. A similar trend was observed for the isoelectric point of MP-KC mixtures, as determined by zeta potential measurements. The maximum interaction indicated by the highest turbidity occurred at pH<sub>max</sub>=5.3, at a ratio of 5:1, whereas pH<sub>c</sub> remained constant during acidification. The changes in electrostatic interactions and transformations of phase behaviors accompanying the complex formation and disassociation processes were further supported by particle size distribution analysis and optical microscopic observations of MP-KC mixtures (R=1:1) at different pH values. This work fills the previous lack of studies on phase behaviors of surimi protein and colloidal polysaccharide in liquid system, and lay the foundation to provide a new way to solve problems of interactions between protein and polysaccharide during the processing of surimi products."
0,"Cryptocaryon irritans is an important protozoan parasite which infects almost all kinds of marine teleosts, causing heavy economic losses. In our previous studies, we found that rabbitfish (Siganus oramin) displayed high resistance to C. irritans infection, and a novel protein, l-amino acid oxidase (LAAO), was identified from the serum that was lethal to C. irritans. In this study, the rabbitfish were firstly infected with a high dose of C. irritans, then the LAAO mRNA expression pattern and the activity of three enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase] were measured in various tissues. The results indicated that, after infection, the feeding and swimming of rabbitfish was normal, and the infection intensity in the host was low. Tissue distribution analysis showed that LAAO mRNA was most pronounced in the head kidney and gill, with lower expression observed in the muscle. After infection with C. irritans, the LAAO mRNA was up-regulated early post infection (from 6 to 24 h) in both gill and spleen, but then returned to normal levels, implying that LAAO may play an important role in the host's early immune response. The SOD activity in the liver was significantly higher in the infection group than in the control group by 48 h post infection, while Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activities in the gill were decreased by 12 and 24 h after infection; no significant difference was detected at the other time points throughout the experiment. Together, these results suggest that biochemical responses of rabbitfish are relatively mild after infection with a high dose of parasite, and the LAAO may play an important role in the host's defense against C. irritans."
0,"The effect and mechanisms of calcium chloride and citric acid addition on the acid method of processing tilapia protein isolates and surimi gels were studied. The alkaline method shows better gel quality than the acid method with lower yield and high lipid content. The addition of calcium chloride increased the breaking force to 494.56 g and citric acid helped reducing the lipid content by 85.85%, resulting in a higher yield of 75.36%. Gels with calcium maintained low levels of expressible moisture (2.30%), indicating a well-organised gel matrix. The decrease in -SH content and increase in ionic bonds content suggested increased formation of disulphide bonds and ionic bonds. Oscillatory dynamic measurement indicated that more heat resistant bonds were formed. The morphology of myofibril proteins studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the height of the proteins in the calcium-added gels decreased 79.4%, which suggested that the protein structure was ""suppressed""."
0,"Previous experiments with Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) have demonstrated that dietary lipid levels above 8% impaired growth and did not promote protein retention. We hypothesised that this low ability to use high-lipid diets may depend on the dietary protein level. In the present study, a 2 × 2 factorial design was applied where two dietary lipid (4-17% DM) and two dietary protein (below and above the requirement levels, 48 and 54% DM) levels were tested in juveniles for 114 d. Growth performance was not improved by the increase in dietary fat, irrespectively of the dietary protein levels. Protein retention was similar among the diets, although fish fed the diets with high lipid content resulted in significantly lower protein gain. Among the enzymes involved in amino acid catabolism, only aspartate aminotransferase activity in the liver was affected by the dietary lipid levels, being stimulated in fish fed high-lipid diets. Moreover, phosphofructokinase 1 activity was significantly elevated in the muscle of Senegalese sole fed 4% lipid diets, suggesting enhanced glycolysis in the muscle when the dietary lipid supply was limited and dietary starch increased. The results confirmed that high-lipid diets do not enhance growth, and data from the selected enzymes support the assumption that lipids are not efficiently used for energy production and protein sparing, even when dietary protein is below the protein requirement of the species. Furthermore, data suggest a significant role of glucose as the energy source in Senegalese sole."
0,"The mucus of fish skin plays a vital role in innate immune defense. Some mucus proteins have the potential to incapacitate pathogens and/or inhibit their passage through the skin. In this study the aim was to isolate and characterize galectin(s), β-galactosides binding proteins, present in skin mucus. A novel short form of galectin-3 was isolated from Atlantic salmon skin mucus by α-lactose agarose based affinity chromatography followed by Sephadex G-15 gel filtration. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that the isolated protein was the C-terminal half of galectin-3 (galectin-3C). Galectin-3C showed calcium independent and lactose inhabitable hemagglutination, and agglutinated the Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria <i>Moritella viscosa</i>. Galectin-3 mRNA was highly expressed in skin and gill, followed by muscle, hindgut, spleen, stomach, foregut, head kidney, and liver. <i>Moritella viscosa</i> incubated with galectin-3C had a modified proteome. Proteins with changed abundance included multidrug transporter and three ribosomal proteins L7/12, S2, and S13. Overall, this study shows the isolation and characterization of a novel galectin-3 short form involved in pathogen recognition and modulation, and hence in immune defense of Atlantic salmon."
0,"Surimi seafoods (fish/poikilotherm protein) in the U.S.A. are typically cooked rapidly to 90+°C, while comminuted products made from land animals (meat/homeotherm protein) are purposely cooked much more slowly, and to lower endpoint temperatures (near 70 °C). We studied heating rate (0.5, 25, or 90 °C/min) and endpoint temperature (45 to 90 °C) effects on rheological properties (fracture, small strain) of washed myofibril gels derived from fish (Alaska pollock) compared with chicken breast at a common pH (6.75). This was contrasted with published data on gelation kinetics of chicken myosin over the same temperature range. Heating rate had no effect on fracture properties of fish gels but slow heating did yield somewhat stronger, but not more deformable, chicken gels. Maximum gel strength by rapid heating could be achieved within 5 min holding after less than 1 min heating time. Dynamic testing by small strain revealed poor correspondence of the present data to that published for gelling response of chicken breast myosin in the same temperature range. The common practice of reporting small-strain rheological parameters measured at the endpoint temperature was also shown to be misleading, since upon cooling, there was much less difference in rigidity between rapidly and slowly heated gels for either species.

0,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are members of the Cys-loop superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. The electric organ of the Torpedo ray is extraordinarily rich in an acetylcholine receptor that is homologous to the human nicotinic receptor found at the neuromuscular junction. Due to this abundant natural source in the fish and the relatively accessible preparation of the neuromuscular junction (compared to a central synapse), this muscle-type receptor and specifically the fish receptors have long been used as the prototype for study of nicotinic receptors. However, an absence of structural detail at high resolution has limited the chemical interpretation of this archetypal nicotinic receptor. One of the main concerns in preparing receptor for high resolution structural analysis was its documented sensitivity to particular detergents and requirements for specific lipids in order to maintain function after reconstitution in a membrane. Here, we present methods for purifying native nicotinic receptor from Torpedo electric tissue that maintains functionality after reconstitution and that is amenable to high resolution structural analysis. The specific developments we describe include detergent exchange during purification, inclusion of specific lipids during purification and for nanodisc reconstitution, and synthesis of a new affinity reagent for rapid isolation of receptors."
0,"Red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus, is an estuarine-dependent fish species commonly found in the Gulf of Mexico and along the coast of the southeastern United States. This economically important species has demonstrated freshwater tolerance; however, the physiological mechanisms and costs related to freshwater exposure remain poorly understood. The current study therefore investigated the physiological response of red drum using an acute freshwater transfer protocol. Plasma osmolality, Cl⁻, Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ were all significantly reduced by 24h post-transfer; Cl⁻ and Mg²⁺ recovered to control levels by 7days post-transfer. No effect of transfer was observed on muscle water content; however, muscle Cl⁻ was significantly reduced. Interestingly, plasma and muscle Na⁺ content was unaffected by freshwater transfer. Intestinal fluid was absent by 24h post-transfer indicating cessation of drinking. Branchial gene expression analysis showed that both CFTR and NKCC1 exhibited significant down-regulation at 8 and 24h post-transfer, respectively, although transfer had no impact on NHE2, NHE3 or Na⁺, K⁺ ATPase (NKA) activity. These general findings are supported by immunohistochemical analysis, which revealed no apparent NKCC containing cells in the gills at 7days post transfer while NKA cells localization was unaffected. The results of the current study suggest that red drum can effectively regulate Na⁺ balance upon freshwater exposure using already present Na⁺ uptake pathways while also down-regulating ion excretion mechanisms."
0,"Fish protein hydrolysate was prepared from muscle of small red scorpionfish (Scorpaena notata) by treatment with a protease from the fungus Penicillium digitatum. Protein hydrolysate was found to strongly inhibit the angiotensin I converting enzyme and exhibited high antioxidative activity through 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging assay. After ultrafiltration, peptides were isolated by a two-step procedure: size exclusion chromatography on a Toyopearl HW-40 followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with a high purification yield of 2.5 mg of peptide per gram of initial protein. Two major peptides were then identified by nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS), corresponding to the following sequences: Leu-Val-Thr-Gly-Asp-Asp-Lys-Thr-Asn-Leu-Lys (1,204.665 Da) and Asp-Thr-Gly-Ser-Asp-Lys-Lys-Gln-Leu (992.511 Da). These peptides, mainly composed of hydrophilic amino acids, showed high antioxidative and angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory activities. These data suggest that the two novel peptides isolated from the muscle hydrolysate of small red scorpionfish can be a beneficial ingredient for functional foods or pharmaceuticals against hypertension and oxidative stress."
0,"The double-Ig-IL-1R related molecule (DIGIRR) is a member of the TIR (Toll -Interleukin-1 receptor) superfamily and plays an important role in the immune system, it is also as a negative regulator of the IL-1 signaling pathway. In this study, we identified and characterized the miiuy croaker DIGIRR (mmi-DIGIRR) gene. The results of gene structure analysis indicated that there were differences between the mmi-DIGIRR and mammalian SIGIRR, which there were two immunoglobulin (Ig) domains contained in extracellular region of mmi-DIGIRR. Sequence alignment analysis showed that fish DIGIRR shared some conserved sequences with other vertebrates and the evolution was relatively conservative. In order to further validate the function of mmi-DIGIRR and its expression levels in various tissues of fish, qRT-PCR has been conducted. The results showed DIGIRR has significant expression levels in liver, skin and muscle while expression levels in heart are low. The LPS-induced NF-κB activation was inhibited by overexpression of DIGIRR significantly. In conclusion, the evolution and function of mmi-DIGIRR were comprehensively analyzed in this study, which would provide a theoretical basis for the future research of fish DIGIRR."
0,"Cathepsin L (Cat L) in carp (Cyprinus carpio) dorsal muscles was purified and its molecular weight determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was 36 kDa. Its optimal temperature and pH were 50 °C and 5.5, respectively. The results of the effects of specific substrates, activators and inhibitors on the enzymatic activity showed that Cat L belongs to the family of cysteine proteinases containing thiol. Compared to the control, the gel strength of surimi with the addition of purified Cat L decreased significantly by 24.33% while that of surimi with both purified Cat L and inhibitors increased by 13.7% and 21.6%, respectively, suggesting the participation of Cat L in the modori phenomenon occurring in carp surimi. Both the SDS-PAGE electrophoretic pattern and microstructure figure revealed that Cat L could hydrolyse the main protein in carp surimi and was one of the enzymes involved in the modori phenomenon."
0,"Thioredoxin(Trx)with a redox-active disulfide/dithiol in the active site, is an ubiquitous disulfide reductase majorly responsible for maintaining the balance of reactive oxygen species. In this study, the complete thioredoxin-like protein 1 (designated as LcTrx) was cloned from large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea through rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The full-length cDNA of LcTrx was 1295 bp in length containing a 131 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR) ,a 3'UTR of 294bp with a poly (A) tail, and an 870 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 289 amino acids. Protein sequence analysis revealed that LcTrx contains the evolutionarily conserved redox motif CRPC (Cys-Arg-Pro-Cys-). Multiple alignments revealed that LcTrx is highly identical to Trx from other organisms, especially in the CRPC motifs. The recombinant LcTrx showed obvious insulin reduction activity in vitro. The LcTrx transcripts were constitutively expressed in all examined tissues with the highest levels found in the muscles and the lowest in the head kidney. Results of Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection experiment showed that the expression levels of LcTrx were tissue and time dependent. In the liver and kidney, LcTrx was down-regulated both at 12 h and 48 h post-infection. In contrast, LcTrx showed induced expression in the spleen and head kidney at same post-infection time points. The different responses to pathogen stimulation indicated the diversified physiological function of LcTrx in the four examined tissues."
0,"Fish can be potentially co-infected by two or more bacterial strains, which can make synergistic influence on the virulence of infection. In this study, two opportunistic and multidrug resistant Aeromonas strains were isolated from wounds of morbid zebrafish with typical deep skin lesions similar to Motile Aeromonas Septicemia. Isolates were genetically identified as A. hydrophila and A. veronii by 16 S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Both isolates were positive for virulent genes (aerA, lip, ser, exu gcaT) and selected phenotypic tests (DNase, protease, gelatinase, lipase, biofilm production and β-haemolysis). A. hydrophila and A. veronii had strong antibiotic resistance against ampicillin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, kanamycin, erythromycin, clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Histopathological studies revealed that co-infection causes severe necrosis and hypertrophy in the muscles, kidney and liver of zebrafish. Naturally co-infected zebrafish showed highly induced tnf-α, il-1β, il-6, il-12, ifn, ifn-γ, cxcl18 b and ccl34a.4 at transcription level compared to healthy fish, suggesting virulence factors may activate immune and inflammatory responses of zebrafish. Experimentally infected zebrafish showed significantly higher mortality under co-infection with A. hydrohila and A. veronii (87%), followed by individual challenge of A. hydrophila (72%) or A. veronii (67%) suggesting that virulence of A. hydrophila have greater pathogenicity than A. veronii during co-infection."
0,"To improve the quality of cultured large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), this study was performed to study the impacts of glycerol monolaurate (GML) on the nutritional value, growth performance, muscle texture, and taste intensity of L. crocea. The results showed that GML as a feed additive significantly increased the crude lipid content and reduced the diameters of muscle fibers, which in turn markedly altered the flesh texture in terms of cohesiveness. Moreover, the taste indicators (umami and richness) and flavor-related amino acid (glutamic acid, glycine, and proline) contents of L. crocea muscle were significantly higher in the GML group. Metabolomic and gene expression analyses showed that GML supplementation could significantly improve amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, promote protein and lipid synthesis, and activate myogenic-related signaling pathways of L. crocea. Consequently, adding an appropriate amount of GML to fish feed would be conducive to providing healthy, nutrient-rich and acceptably flavored aquatic-products."
0,"Siglec-3/CD33 is a myeloid-specific inhibitory receptor that is expressed on cells of the immune system, where it is believed to play a regulatory role, modulating the inflammatory and immune responses. We characterized CD33 (RbCD33) in rock bream which is a transmembrane protein with two IG-like domains and a cytoplasmic tail. It has a deduced amino acid sequence of 390 residues and has tyrosine-based signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic tail. The RbCD33 mRNA was highly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes and was also detected in the muscle, spleen, skin, head kidney, gills, trunk kidney, heart, stomach, brain, intestine and liver by quantitative real-time PCR. A temporal variation in expression of RbCD33 was observed in different tissues after stimulating with E. tarda, S. iniae and red seabream iridovirus (RSIV). In the head kidney tissue, E. tarda and S. iniae induced RbCD33, while a down regulation was observed with RSIV. In addition, in spleen tissue, S. iniae caused a very high induction of RbCD33 in comparison with an E. tarda and RSIV challenge. In the liver and gill tissues, all three pathogens induced a high expression of RbCD33. The expression pattern in various tissues and its high induction after pathogen stimulation suggests that RbCD33 plays an important role in initiating the immune response via the inhibition of signal transduction of the myeloid lineage cells."
0,"Intermuscular bones (IBs) and ribs both are a part of skeletal system in teleosts, but with different developing process. The chemical composition of fish IBs and ribs as well as the underlying mechanism about their development have not been investigated. In the present study, histological structures showed that one bone cavity containing osteoclasts were existed in ribs, but not in IBs of Megalobrama amblycephala. We constructed the first proteomics map for fish bones including IBs and ribs, and identified the differentially expressed proteins between IBs and ribs through iTRAQ LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis."
1,"The proteins extracted from IBs and ribs at 1- to 2-year old M. amblycephala were quantified 2,342 proteins, with 1,451 proteins annotated with GO annotation in biological processes, molecular function and cellular component. A number of bone related proteins as well as pathways were identified in the study. A total of 93 and 154 differently expressed proteins were identified in comparison groups of 1-IB-vs-1-Rib and 2-IB-vs-2-Rib, which indicated the obvious differences of chemical composition between these two bone tissues. The two proteins (vitronectin b precursor and matrix metalloproteinase-2) related to osteoclasts differentiation were significantly up-regulated in ribs compared with IBs (P < 0.05), which was in accordance with the results from histological structures. In comparison groups of 1-IB-vs-2-IB and 1-Rib-vs-2-Rib, 33 and 51 differently expressed proteins were identified and the function annotation results showed that these proteins were involved in regulating bone development and differentiation. Subsequently, 11 and 13 candidate proteins in comparison group of 1-IB-vs-1-Rib and 1-IB-vs-2-IB related to bone development were validated by MRM assays."
2,Our present study suggested the different key proteins involved in the composition of fish ribs and IBs as well as their growth development. These findings could provide important clues towards further understanding of fish skeletal system and the roles of proteins playing in regulating diverse biological processes in fish.
0,"The suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is an essential feedback regulator extensively involved in many different cytokine signaling pathways, such as regulation of the immune system and growth of organism. However, the molecular and functional information on socs1 genes in freshwater fish is unclear. In the present paper, we identified and characterized the full-length closely related but distinct socs1 genes (socs 1a and -1b) in blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala). The bioinformatic analysis results showed that duplicated socs1s shared majority conserved motifs with other vertebrates. Both socs1a and -1b mRNAs were detected throughout embryogenesis, and gradually increase and then constantly expressed after 16 hpf. Whole-mount in situ hybridization demonstrated that socs1a and socs1b mRNAs were detected in the brain at 12hpf and 24hpf, and in the notochord and brain at 36hpf. In adult fish, the socs1a mRNA were strongly expressed in the heart, eye, kidney, spleen and gonad, but were found to be relatively low in the intestine and liver. On the other hand, the expression of socs1b mRNA was significantly high in the muscle, eye and spleen, and relatively low in the intestine, liver, skin and heart. The results of hGH treatment experiment showed that socs1a and 1b mRNAs were upregulated markedly in the kidney, muscle and liver. Overexpression of socs1s significantly inhibit the GH and JAK/STAT factor stat3 and the inhibitory effect of SOCS1s on GH may be involved in JAK-STAT signaling pathway. These results indicate that SOCS1 plays an important role in regulating growth and development."
0,"Successful production of aquaculture species depends on efficient growth with low susceptibility to disease. Therefore, selection programs have focused on rapid growth combined with disease resistance. However, chronic immune stimulation diminishes muscle growth (a syndrome referred to as cachexia), and decreases growth efficiency in production animals, including rainbow trout. In mammals, recent results show that increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as those seen during an immune assault, specifically target myosin and MyoD and inhibit muscle growth. This suggests that increased disease resistance in fish, a desired trait for production, may actually decrease the growth of muscle, the main aquacultural commodity. To test this possibility, a rainbow trout model of cachexia was developed and characterized. A six-week study was conducted in which rainbow trout were chronically immune stimulated by repeated injections of LPS. Growth indices were monitored, and whole body and muscle proximate analyses, real-time PCR, and Western blotting were conducted to examine the resulting cachectic phenotype. Muscle ratio was decreased in fish chronically immunostimulated, however expression levels of MyoD2 and myosin were not decreased compared to fish that were not immunostimulated, indicating that while muscle accretion was altered, the mechanism by which it occurred was somewhat different than that characterized in mammals. Microarray analysis was used to compare gene expression in fish that had been chronically immunostimulated versus those that had not to identify possible alternative mechanisms of cachexia in fish."
0,"Hybrid Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, ♀) × blue tilapia (O. aureus, ♂) is a widely cultured tilapia variety due to its growth vigor compared to the parent species. As a peptide hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) plays a critical role in regulating somatic growth. The present study focuses on the expression characteristics of IGF-1 in hybrid tilapia. The cloned complete open reading frame of IGF-1 in hybrid tilapia is 549 bp in length, encoding a protein of 182 amino acids. The deduced protein is highly similar to that of Nile tilapia and blue tilapia. IGF-1 was found to be primarily expressed in the liver and muscle in the hybrid; lower expression levels were found in other tissues such as the intestine, spleen, and head-kidney. Increased mRNA expression was observed in the liver and muscle of the hybrid compared to Nile tilapia and blue tilapia, indicating a nonadditive expression pattern in the hybrid. An IGF-1 SNP site (397 site: C in Nile tilapia, G in blue tilapia) for differentiating the Nile tilapia or blue tilapia subgenome in hybrids was identified. Pyrosequencing analysis of the liver transcriptome indicated that most of the hybrids (9 of 10 individuals) predominantly expressed the G allele, demonstrating bias of the blue tilapia subgenome. The present study provides novel data indicating, for the first time, overall gene expression of IGF-1 and allele-specific expression in hybrid tilapia."
0,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are the most commercialized nanomaterial worldwide, mainly due to their microbicidal activity. Although, AgNPs have been shown to be toxic to aquatic species, their effect on endemic fish, like Goodeidae, has not been demonstrated. Endemic species are under strong pressures by anthropogenic contamination and destruction of their habitat; therefore, we studied adult Chapalichthys pardalis, an endemic fish of Mexico. We evaluated the toxic effect of AgNPs through oxidative stress, macromolecular and metabolic biomarkers. We determined the LC<sub>50</sub> (96h) and performed subchronic tests (21days) using sublethal AgNPs concentrations (equivalent to CL<sub>1</sub> and CL<sub>10</sub>). At the end of the bioassay, we quantified 10 stress biomarkers in the liver, gills, and muscle, including the antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], and glutathione [GPx]), thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), protein oxidation (CO), macromolecules (proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates), and metabolites (glucose and lactate). In addition, we determined the integrated biomarkers response (IBR). LC<sub>50</sub> was of 10.32mgL<sup>-1</sup>. Results of subchronic exposure (21days) revealed that AgNPs produce oxidative stress in C. pardalis adults, as evidenced by a diminution in antioxidant enzymes activity and an increase in TBARS and oxidized proteins. AgNPs also diminished levels of macromolecules and generated a high-energy consumption, reflected in the reduction of glucose levels, although lactate levels were not altered. The IBR analysis evidenced that the largest effect was produced in organisms exposed to LC<sub>10</sub>, being the liver and gills the organs with the greatest damage. Results demonstrated that exposure to AgNPs induces acute and chronic toxic effects on C. pardalis and forewarns about the impact that these nanomaterials can exert on these ecologically relevant aquatic organisms."
0,"A study was conducted to compare astaxanthin binding ability of solubilized muscle proteins of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus L.) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.). Muscle proteins of juvenile Atlantic salmon, haddock and halibut were solubilized by sequential extraction of muscle tissue using low ionic strength solutions. Electrophoretic protein profiles of the six solubilized fractions from these species were similar. Each solubilized fraction from the three species was examined for its relative astaxanthin binding capacity. The amount of bound astaxanthin was significantly different (P<0.05) among the six fractions of each species. Significant differences in astaxanthin binding were only found for fractions A and E among the species. The amount of bound astaxanthin in various fractions of each species showed a good correlation (R2=0.80-0.92) with the ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate) fluorescence intensity of those fractions. The pattern and extent of astaxanthin binding to the muscle proteins of juvenile salmon, haddock and halibut is comparable to that reported previously for adult Atlantic salmon (Saha, M.R., Ross, N.W., Gill, T.A., Olsen, R.E., Lall, S.P., 2005. Development of a method to assess binding of astaxanthin to Atlantic salmon S. salar L. muscle proteins. Aquacult. Res. 36, 336-343.). These combined observations suggest that the carotenoid binding capacity of the muscle proteins of salmon is not the limiting factor in the deposition of carotenoid in their flesh."
0,"MC analysis of biological tissue is considered to be very difficult due to the lack of validated methods. This is the primary limiting factor for monitoring potential risks in both the flesh of aquatic organisms and the aquatic ecosystem. In this study, an effective method to determine free MCs (MC-LR and MC-RR) in the muscle and liver tissues of freshwater cultured fish was developed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). The extraction solvent, time of extraction, eluent and purification of the extract were optimized. Various SPE cartridges were also investigated. In this optimized analytical procedure, an 85% methanol/water solution (v/v) was selected as the extraction solvent, after which the extracts were purified by removing fats and proteins; a HLB cartridge was chosen for MCs enrichment; and 90% methanol containing 0.02% formic acid/water solution (v/v) was used as the eluent. Under the optimized pretreatment conditions and instrument parameters, good recoveries of MC-LR and MC-RR were obtained at three concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 µg g<sup>-1</sup> dry weight (DW)), with values ranging from 92.5 to 98.3% and 92.1 to 98.6%, respectively. The method detection limit (MDL) for muscle samples was 0.5 µg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 0.4 µg kg<sup>-1</sup> (DW) for MC-LR and MC-RR, respectively. The MDL for the liver samples was 0.8 µg kg<sup>-1</sup> (DW) for both MC-LR and MC-RR. The developed procedure was successfully applied to analyze MCs in the muscle and liver of fish samples collected from a Chinese freshwater aquaculture pond during bloom seasons. The MC-LR concentrations ranged from below the MDL to 4.17 µg kg<sup>-1</sup> and the MC-RR concentrations ranged from below the MDL to 2.64 µg kg<sup>-1</sup>."
0,"The unusual pattern of expression of hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb) among Antarctic notothenioid fishes provides an exceptional model system for assessing the impact of these proteins on oxidative stress. We tested the hypothesis that the lack of oxygen-binding proteins may reduce oxidative stress. Levels and activity of pro-oxidants and small-molecule and enzymatic antioxidants, and levels of oxidized lipids and proteins in the liver, oxidative skeletal muscle and heart ventricle were quantified in five species of notothenioid fishes differing in the expression of Hb and Mb. Levels of ubiquitinated proteins and rates of protein degradation by the 20S proteasome were also quantified. Although levels of oxidized proteins and lipids, ubiquitinated proteins, and antioxidants were higher in red-blooded fishes than in Hb-less icefishes in some tissues, this pattern did not persist across all tissues. Expression of Mb was not associated with oxidative damage in the heart ventricle, whereas the activity of citrate synthase and the contents of heme were positively correlated with oxidative damage in most tissues. Despite some tissue differences in levels of protein carbonyls among species, rates of degradation by the 20S proteasome were not markedly different, suggesting either alternative pathways for eliminating oxidized proteins or that redox tone varies among species. Together, our data indicate that the loss of Hb and Mb does not correspond with a clear pattern of either reduced oxidative defense or oxidative damage."
0,"A 2×3 factorial design was employed to evaluate the effects of dietary vitamin C (l-ascorblyl-2-monophosphate, C2MP) levels on growth and tissue mercury (Hg) accumulations in juvenile olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. Six experimental diets with two levels of mercuric chloride (0 or 20mg HgCl2/kg diet) and three levels of vitamin C (0, 100, or 200mg C2MP/kg diet) were added to the basal diet. At the end of 6 weeks feeding trial, in presence or absence of dietary Hg, fish body weight gain, specific growth rate, feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio and whole body lipid content were increased in a dose-dependent manner as dietary vitamin C level increased in the diets. Interestingly, fish fed 100 or 200mg C2MP/kg diets showed significant interactive effects on reducing Hg content in kidney tissue. These results revealed that dietary vitamin C as 100 or 200mg C2MP/kg diet had protective effect against Hg accumulation in juvenile olive flounder. "
0,"Deletion or inhibition of myostatin in mammals has been demonstrated to markedly increase muscle mass by hyperplasia, hypertrophy, or a combination of both. Despite a remarkably high degree of conservation with the mammalian protein, the function of myostatin remains unknown in fish, many species of which continue muscle growth throughout the lifecycle by hyperplasia. Transgenic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) overexpressing follistatin, one of the more efficacious antagonists of myostatin, were produced to investigate the effect of this protein on muscle development and growth. P(1) transgenics overexpressing follistatin in muscle tissue exhibited increased epaxial and hypaxial muscling similar to that observed in double-muscled cattle and myostatin null mice. The hypaxial muscling generated a phenotype reminiscent of well-developed rectus abdominus and intercostal muscles in humans and was dubbed ""six pack."" Body conformation of the transgenic animals was markedly altered, as measured by condition factor, and total muscle surface area increased. The increased muscling was due almost exclusively to hyperplasia as evidenced by a higher number of fibers per unit area and increases in the percentage of smaller fibers and the number of total fibers. In several individuals, asymmetrical muscling was observed, but no changes in mobility or behavior of follistatin fish were observed. The findings indicate that overexpression of follistatin in trout, a species with indeterminate growth rate, enhances muscle growth. It remains to be determined whether the double muscling in trout is due to inhibition of myostatin, other growth factors, or both."
0,"1. Analysis of stable carbon isotopes is a valuable tool for studies of diet, habitat use and migration. However, significant variability in the degree of trophic fractionation (Delta(13)C(C-D)) between consumer (C) and diet (D) has highlighted our lack of understanding of the biochemical and physiological underpinnings of stable isotope ratios in tissues. 2. An opportunity now exists to increase the specificity of dietary studies by analyzing the delta(13)C values of amino acids (AAs). Common mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus, Linnaeus 1766) were reared on four isotopically distinct diets to examine individual AA Delta(13)C(C-D) variability in fish muscle. 3. Modest bulk tissue Delta(13)C(C-D) values reflected relatively large trophic fractionation for many non-essential AAs and little to no fractionation for all essential AAs. 4. Essential AA delta(13)C values were not significantly different between diet and consumer (Delta(13)C(C-D) = 0.0 +/- 0.4 per thousand), making them ideal tracers of carbon sources at the base of the food web. Stable isotope analysis of muscle essential AAs provides a promising tool for dietary reconstruction and identifying baseline delta(13)C values to track animal movement through isotopically distinct food webs. 5. Non-essential AA Delta(13)C(C-D) values showed evidence of both de novo biosynthesis and direct isotopic routing from dietary protein. We attributed patterns in Delta(13)C(C-D) to variability in protein content and AA composition of the diet as well as differential utilization of dietary constituents contributing to the bulk carbon pool. This variability illustrates the complicated nature of metabolism and suggests caution must be taken with the assumptions used to interpret bulk stable isotope data in dietary studies. 6. Our study is the first to investigate the expression of AA Delta(13)C(C-D) values for a marine vertebrate and should provide for significant refinements in studies of diet, habitat use and migration using stable isotopes."
0,"Fresh sierra fish (Scomberomorus sierra) fillets were packed in low-density polyethylene films with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT-LDPE) added. Fillets packed in LDPE with no BHT were used as controls (LDPE). The packed fillets were stored at -25 degrees C for 120 days in which the film released 66.5% of the antioxidant. The influence of the antioxidant on lipid and protein quality, lipid oxidation, muscle structure changes, and shear-force resistance was recorded. As compared to LDPE films, fillets packed in BHT-LDPE films showed lower lipid oxidation, thiobarbituric acid values (4.20 +/- 0.52 vs 11.95 +/- 1.06 mg malonaldehyde/kg), peroxide values (7.20 +/- 1.38 vs 15.15 +/- 1.48 meq/kg), and free fatty acids (7.98 +/- 0.43 vs 11.83 +/- 1.26% of oleic acid). Fillets packed in BHT-LDPE films showed less tissue damage and lost less firmness than fillets packed in LDPE. A significant relationship between lipid oxidation and texture was detected (R2 adjusted, 0.70-0.73). BHT-LDPE films may be used not only to prevent lipid oxidation but also to minimize protein damage to prolong the shelf life of sierra fish."
0,"The present study is conducted to determine the effect of acute and chronic zinc (Zn) exposure on carnitine concentration, carnitine palmitoyltransferases I (CPT I) kinetics, and expression levels of CPT I isoforms in liver, muscle and heart of yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco. To this end, yellow catfish are subjected to chronic waterborne Zn exposure (0.05 mg Zn L(-1), 0.35 mg Zn L(-1) and 0.86 mg Zn L(-1), respectively) for 8 weeks and acute Zn exposure (0.05 mg Zn L(-1) and 4.71 mg L(-1)Zn, respectively) for 96 h, respectively. Reduced Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) and maximal reaction rates (Vmax) values in liver and muscle are observed in fish exposed to chronic Zn concentration. In contrast, Vmax and Km values in heart increase with increasing Zn concentration. Chronic Zn exposure also significantly influences the contents of free carnitine (FC), total carnitine (TC) and acylcarnitine (AC) in liver and heart, but not in muscle. The acute Zn exposure significantly increases FC, AC, TC contents in liver and muscle, but reduces their contents in heart. The chronic and acute Zn exposure influences the mRNA levels of four CPT I isoforms (CPT Iα1b, CPT Iβ, CPT Iα2a and CPT Iα1a) in liver, muscle and heart. Furthermore, correlations are observed in the mRNA levels between CPT I isoforms and Km, and between isoforms expression and activity of CPT I. Thus, chronic and acute Zn exposure shows differential effects on carnitine content, CPT I kinetics and mRNA levels of four CPT I isoforms in yellow catfish, which provides new mechanism for Zn exposure on lipid metabolism and also novel insights into Zn toxicity in fish."
0,"Aspolin is a muscular protein having unique structural characteristics where the most part of its primary structure is occupied by aspartic acid. Aspolin has been found exceptionally in fish muscle, suggesting its specific role in this tissue. However, biological functions of aspolin have remained unknown. In the present study, we cloned full-length cDNAs encoding zebrafish Danio rerio aspolins 1 and 2, revealed their genomic organization, and examined in vivo function using knockdown techniques. Genomic analysis clearly showed that aspolin is a paralog of the histidine-rich calcium binding protein gene, which encodes a calcium binding protein in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Expression analysis showed that the transcripts and their translated products, aspolins 1 and 2, are distributed in myotomal skeletal muscle, but not in cardiac muscle. Injection of antisense morpholino oligo targeting both aspolins 1 and 2 increased the mRNA levels of calsequestrin 1, another calcium binding protein in SR. These lines of evidence suggest that aspolins regulate calcium concentrations in SR."
0,"Levels of some trace and essential elements, including Al, B, Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Sr, and Zn, were determined in 17 different fish species from Sakarya River, Çark Stream, Sapanca Lake, and Western Black Sea using ICP-OES after microwave (MW) digestion procedure. During preparation of samples for analysis, wet and MW digestion methods were also compared. Accuracy of the digestion methods was checked by the analysis of DORM-3 reference material (Fish Protein Certified Reference Material for Trace Metals). Concentrations of trace elements were found as Al: 6.5-48.5, B: 0.06-3.30, Ba: 0.09-2.92, Cr: 0.02-1.64, Cu: 0.13-2.28, Fe: 7.28-39.9, Mn: 0.08-11.4, Ni: 0.01-26.1, Sr: 0.17-13.5, and Zn: 11.5-52.9 µg g(-1). The obtained results were compared with other studies published in the literature. Trace element levels in various fish species collected from waters in Sakarya region were found to be below limit values provided by Turkish Food Codex (TFC), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and World Health Organization (WHO)."
0,"The relatively easy access to fish worldwide, alongside the increase of aquaculture production contributes to increased fish consumption which result in higher prevalence of respective allergies. Allergies to fish constitute a significant concern worldwide. β-parvalbumin is the main elicitor for IgE-mediated reactions. Creatine, involved in the muscle energy metabolism, and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), a calcium chelator, are potential molecules to modulate parvalbumin. The purpose of this study was to test creatine (2, 5 and 8%) and EDTA (1.5, 3 and 4.5%) supplementation in fish diets to modulate β-parvalbumin expression and structure and its allergenicity in farmed European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) while assessing its effects on the end-product quality. Fish welfare and muscle quality parameters were evaluated by plasma metabolites, rigor mortis, muscle pH and sensory and texture analysis. Proteomics was used to assess alterations in muscle proteome profile and metabolic fingerprinting by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to assess the liver metabolic profile. In addition, IgE-reactivity to parvalbumin was analysed using fish allergic patient sera. Metabolic fingerprinting of liver tissue revealed no major alterations in infrared spectra with creatine supplementation, while with EDTA, only absorption bands characteristic of lipids were altered. Comparative proteomics showed up regulation of (tropo) myosin and phosphoglycerate mutase 2 with Creatine supplementation. In the case of EDTA proteomics showed up regulation of proteins involved in cellular and ion homeostasis. Allergenicity seems not to be modulated with creatine or EDTA supplementation as no decreased expression levels were found and IgE-binding reactivity showed no quantitative differences."
0,"The bulbus arteriosus is the most anterior chamber of the teleost heart. The present study aimed to establish the presence, and to provide semi-quantitative information on the abundance, of several immune and cell-cycle proteins in the bulbus arteriosus of healthy Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Using immunohistochemistry, lymphocyte-like cells were identified in the bulbus arteriosus using antibodies to CD3ε and MHC class IIβ. Few PCNA positive cells were identified in post-smolt fish as compared to moderate levels of staining in fresh water fry. Interestingly no staining was evident in adult fish (1-3 kg), thus there was a loss of cells expressing cell-cycle regulatory proteins with ontogeny/progressive life-history stages. Eosinophilic granulocytes (EGCs) were identified in the bulbus arteriosus using TNFα and HIF1α antibodies. Anti-caspase 3 immune-reaction identified a strong endothelial cytoplasmic staining in the bulbus arteriosus. Taken together, the immunolocalization of immune-related molecules (CD3, MHC class II and TNFα), cell-cycle regulatory proteins (PCNA and HIF1α) and apoptosis markers (TUNEL, caspase 3) suggest that the bulbus arteriosus may have an immune component within its functional repertoire.

0,"The full-length mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase cDNA of blunt snout bream Megalobrama amblycephala (denoted as MamMnSOD) was identified in liver using homology cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The full-length cDNA of MamMnSOD consisted of 986 bp, with an open reading frame encoding 224 amino acids, a 58-bp 5' untranslated region and a 256-bp 3' untranslated region. The deduced amino acid sequences of MamMnSOD showed high sequence homology to mitochondrial MnSODs from crustaceans. Several motifs, including three mitochondrial MnSOD signatures, amino acid residues responsible for coordinating the manganese, and the putative active center, were almost completely conserved in the deduced amino acid sequences of MamMnSOD. The mRNA expression of MamMnSOD in the tissues of heart, liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, intestine, and gill was examined by quantitative real-time PCR; the highest expression was in the liver. Transcription of MamMnSOD was kinetically modulated in response to nitrite stress in liver and gill tissues. The purified recombinant MamMnSOD showed potent antioxidant activity. Polyclonal antibodies generated from the recombinant product of MamMnSOD were used to specifically identify the native protein in liver of M. amblycephala. Collectively, the findings of this study strongly suggested that MamMnSOD combats oxidative stress and cellular damage induced by nitrite, by detoxifying harmful reactive oxygen species in M. amblycephala.

0,"Present work describes a laboratory study aiming at assessing the impact of sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents on fish health by means of biochemical and histopathological biomarkers in muscular tissue of fish. Labeo rohita (7.62 ±0.25 cm, 8.25±0.32 g) was exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of untreated (UT) and treated (T) sewage water obtained from STP, Ludhiana, India. Following the determination of the 96h lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>), the fish were exposed to control (de-chlorinated tap water), treated sewage water, 1/10<sup>th</sup> of LC<sub>50</sub> UT and 1/20<sup>th</sup> of LC<sub>50</sub> UT sewage water. The experiment was conducted for the period of 60 days. Experimental results depicted significant reduction (p<0.05) in muscle-somatic index of 1/10<sup>th</sup> LC<sub>50</sub> UT and 1/20<sup>th</sup> LC<sub>50</sub> UT groups compared to control and treated groups. Fish toxicity induced by untreated sewage water was evident from the significant decrease (p<0.05) in the levels of proteins and significant increase (p<0.05) in content of total lipids in muscular tissue of exposed group fingerlings. Drastic changes in the fatty acids profile and severe histological abnormalities viz. shortening of muscle bundles, edema, hyper-vacuolization, elongation of muscle bundles, gap formation in myofibrils, degenerated myotomes, hemorrhage, inter-myofibrillar space, necrosis, were also recorded in muscular tissue of exposed fingerlings. The intensity of muscular damage in L.rohita was found to increase with increase in duration of exposure. Results demonstrated that untreated sewage water could potentially induce physiological stress and somatic cell toxicity in fish L.rohita. Genotoxicity studies on germ cells of L.rohita fingerlings are further suggested to examine the genotoxic potential of untreated sewage water at high concentrations; this is especially of interest given that many effluents are genotoxic to fish."
0,"Although off-channel habitats in the estuaries of large rivers impart many benefits to fish that rear within them, it is less clear how these habitats benefit migrating anadromous species that utilize these habitats for short periods of time. We evaluated the physiological correlates (nutritional condition, growth, and smoltification) of habitat utilization (main-channel vs. off-channel) by juvenile Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha during emigration. Fish from the off-channel had higher condition factor scores and relative weights than fish from the main-channel throughout the study period. Plasma triglyceride and protein concentrations were significantly different between habitat types and across the sampling period, suggesting that fish utilizing the off-channel habitats were compensating for energy losses associated with emigration as compared to main-channel fish. Growth potential (RNA to DNA ratio) did not vary by habitat or sampling period, presumably due to short residency time. There were no differences in osmoregulatory capacity (gill Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity) based on habitat type. Our results indicate that short-term off-channel habitat use may mitigate for energy declines incurred during migration, but likely does not impart significant gains in energy stores or growth."
0,"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) play an important role in the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer. Although in most species many of these enzymes share high sequence and structural conservation, their existence and functions in the lamprey remain unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBE2A)-like gene in lamprey. The gene, designated as LaUBE2A, contained a 456-bp open reading frame encoding a 152-amino acid protein with a typical UBC domain. Real-time PCR assay showed that LaUBE2A was expressed in various tissues of the adult lamprey, with higher levels in the leukocytes and muscle and lower levels in the skin and liver. The high conservation in amino acid sequence between LaUBE2A and UBE2As from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Cavia porcellus, and Alligator sinensi implied that the function of LaUBE2A may be similar to that of UBE2A."
0,"Leptin is a cytokine that regulates appetite and energy expenditure, where in fishes it is primarily produced in the liver and acts to mobilize carbohydrates. Most fishes have only one leptin receptor (LepR/LepRA1), however, paralogs have recently been documented in a few species. Here we reveal a second leptin receptor (LepRA2) in rainbow trout that is 77% similar to trout LepRA1. Phylogenetic analyses show a salmonid specific genome duplication event as the probable origin of the second LepR in trout. Tissues distributions showed tissue specific expression of these receptors, with <i>lepra1</i> highest in the ovaries, nearly 50-fold higher than <i>lepra2</i>. Interestingly, <i>lepra2</i> was most highly expressed in the liver while hepatic <i>lepra1</i> levels were low. Feed deprivation elicited a decline in plasma leptin, an increase in hepatic <i>lepra2</i> by one week and remained elevated at two weeks, while liver expression of <i>lepra1</i> remained low. By contrast, muscle <i>lepra1</i> mRNA increased at one and two weeks of fasting, while adipose <i>lepra1</i> was concordantly lower in fasted fish. <i>lepra2</i> transcript levels were not affected in muscle and fat. These data show <i>lepra1</i> and <i>lepra2</i> are differentially expressed across tissues and during feed deprivation, suggesting paralog- and tissue-specific functions for these leptin receptors."
0,"For the full use of Spanish mackerel (<i>Scomberomorous niphonius</i>) muscle to produce antioxidant peptides, the proteins of Spanish mackerel muscle were separately hydrolyzed under five kinds of enzymes and in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, and antioxidant peptides were isolated from the protein hydrolysate using ultrafiltration and multiple chromatography methods. The results showed that the hydrolysate (SMPH) prepared using in vitro GI digestion showed the highest degree of hydrolysis (27.45 ± 1.76%) and DPPH radical scavenging activity (52.58 ± 2.68%) at the concentration of 10 mg protein/mL among the six protein hydrolysates, and 12 peptides (SMP-1 to SMP-12) were prepared from SMPH. Among them, SMP-3, SMP-7, SMP-10, and SMP-11 showed the higher DPPH radical scavenging activities and were identified as Pro-Glu-Leu-Asp-Trp (PELDW), Trp-Pro-Asp-His-Trp (WPDHW), and Phe-Gly-Tyr-Asp-Trp-Trp (FGYDWW), and Tyr-Leu-His-Phe-Trp (YLHFW), respectively. PELDW, WPDHW, FGYDWW, and YLHFW showed high scavenging activities on DPPH radical (EC<sub>50</sub> 1.53, 0.70, 0.53, and 0.97 mg/mL, respectively), hydroxyl radical (EC<sub>50</sub> 1.12, 0.38, 0.26, and 0.67 mg/mL, respectively), and superoxide anion radical (EC<sub>50</sub> 0.85, 0.49, 0.34, and 1.37 mg/mL, respectively). Moreover, PELDW, WPDHW, FGYDWW, and YLHFW could dose-dependently inhibit lipid peroxidation in the linoleic acid model system and protect plasmid DNA (pBR322DNA) against oxidative damage induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the tested model systems. In addition, PELDW, WPDHW, FGYDWW, and YLHFW could retain their high activities when they were treated under a low temperature (<60 °C) and a moderate pH environment (pH 5-9). These present results indicate that the protein hydrolysate, fractions, and isolated peptides from Spanish mackerel muscle have strong antioxidant activity and might have the potential to be used in health food products."
0,"Endothermy in vertebrates has been postulated to confer physiological and ecological advantages. In endothermic fish, niche expansion into cooler waters is correlated with specific physiological traits and is hypothesized to lead to greater foraging success and increased fitness. Using the seasonal co-occurrence of three tuna species in the eastern Pacific Ocean as a model system, we used cardiac gene expression data (as a proxy for thermal tolerance to low temperatures), archival tag data, and diet analyses to examine the vertical niche expansion hypothesis for endothermy in situ. Yellowfin, albacore, and Pacific bluefin tuna (PBFT) in the California Current system used more surface, mesopelagic, and deep waters, respectively. Expression of cardiac genes for calcium cycling increased in PBFT and coincided with broader vertical and thermal niche utilization. However, the PBFT diet was less diverse and focused on energy-rich forage fishes but did not show the greatest energy gains. Ecosystem-based management strategies for tunas should thus consider species-specific differences in physiology and foraging specialization. "
0,"Type I interferons are a subset of cytokines playing central roles in host antiviral defense, and their effects depend on the interaction with the heterodimeric receptor complex. Surprisingly, two pairs of the receptor subunits, CRFB1 and CRFB5, and CRFB2 and CRFB5, have been identified in fish, but the studies about preferential receptor usage of different fish IFN subtypes are rather limited. In this study, the three receptor chains of type I IFNs named as On-CRFB1, On-CRFB2 and On-CRFB5 were identified in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. These three genes were constitutively expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest expression level observed in muscle and liver, and were rapidly induced in liver following the stimulation of poly(I:C). Interestingly, it is possible that all three subtypes of tilapia IFNs are able to signal through two pairs of the receptor subunits, On-CRFB1 and On-CRFB5, and On-CRFB2 and On-CRFB5. More importantly, tilapia group I IFNs (On-IFNd and On-IFNh) preferentially signal through a receptor complex composed of On-CRFB1 and On-CRFB5, and group II IFNs (On-IFNc) preferentially signal through a receptor complex comprised of On-CRFB2 and On-CRFB5. The present study thus provides new insights into the receptor usage of group I and group II IFNs in fish."
0,"The micro-flowing water system can improve the flesh quality of freshwater fish using the traditional pond farming method. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon has not yet been explored. This study intends to examine the changes of metabolites in freshwater fish after treatment with the micro-flowing purification system (MFPS). The UPLC-QTOF/MS based metabolomics method was utilized to screen the metabolites and predict the major possible metabolic pathways after MFPS treatment. There were 377 types of metabolites identified in the fish muscle, of which 54-71 represented significant different metabolites identified during different stages of MFPS treatments. The main mechanism of MFPS treatment in improving the quality of grass carp fish muscle was investigated, and the MFPS treatment was shown to improve the flesh quality and the flavor of grass carp fish muscle. This study could provide the theoretical basis for improving the quality of aquatic products."
0,"Two distinct myoglobin (mb) transcripts have been reported in common carp, Cyprinus carpio, which is a hypoxia-tolerant fish living in habitats with greatly fluctuant dissolved oxygen levels. Recombinant protein analysis has shown functional specialization of the two mb transcripts. In this work, analysis for mb-containing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones indicated different genome loci for common carp myoglobin-1 (mb-1) and myoglobin-2 (mb-2) genes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that mb-1 and mb-2 are located on separate chromosomes. In both of the mb-1 and mb-2 containing BAC clones, gene synteny was well conserved with the homologous region on zebrafish chromosome 1, supporting that the common carp specific mb-2 gene originated from the recent whole genome duplication event in cyprinid lineage. Transcription factor binding sites search indicated that both common carp mb genes lacked specificity Protein 1 (Sp1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) binding sites, which mediated muscle-specific and calcium-dependent expression in the well-studied mb promoters. Potential hypoxia response elements (HREs) were predicted in the regulatory region of common carp mb genes. These characteristics of common carp mb gene regulatory region well interpreted the hypoxia-inducible, non-muscle expression pattern of mb-1. In the case of mb-2, a 10 bp insertion to the binding site of upstream stimulatory factor (USF), which was a co-factor of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), might cause the non-response to hypoxia treatment of mb-2. The case of common carp mb gene duplication and subsequent differentiation in expression pattern and protein function provided an example for adaptive evolution toward aquatic hypoxia tolerance."
0,"Lipoic acid (LA) is an antioxidant that also favors glucose uptake in mammals. Until now, there are no studies evaluating the potential effect of this molecule on glycemic control in fish. It was evaluated LA effects on glucose uptake in common carp Cyprinus carpio fed with carbohydrate diets from two carbohydrate sources: glucose (GLU) and starch (STA), and supplemented or not with LA, being the diets: +GLU/-LA (GLU); +GLU/+LA (GLU + LA); +STA/-LA (STA); and +STA/+LA (STA + LA). Carp juveniles (6.5 ± 0.1 g) were fed with each diet ad libitum 4 times a day, during 68 days. Muscle glycogen concentration was higher (p < 0.05) in GLU and GLU + LA than in STA and STA + LA groups. On fish fed with starch, muscle cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were higher (p < 0.05) in fish fed diets supplemented with LA. Muscle protein levels were higher in fish fed with LA, independent of the diet carbohydrate source. Lipid peroxidation was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in fish muscle on fish fed the STA + LA diets when compared with the STA diet. Our findings indicate that LA modulates lipid, proteins and carbohydrate metabolism together with the well-known antioxidant effect. Also, LA showed to enhance starch utilization taking into account muscle cholesterol and triglyceride levels."
0,"Among 15 marine fish species, we sought to identify those most beneficial to renal patients by evaluating their phosphorus (P), protein (PC), and n-3 fatty-acid (n-3 PUFA) content."
1,"These 15 species are all edible. They were obtained and sampled randomly, and were filleted to obtain 100g, enabling us to perform the analysis in triplicate. Crude protein was analyzed with a Kjeltec, and minerals were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry."
2,"The PC values (g/100g) ranged from 14.3 (blue runner; BR) to 22.8 (California butterfly ray). The fish with the highest P (mg/100g) content were spotted sea trout (ST), gafftopsail fish (CF) (289), and BR (274), followed by smalltail shark (272). The species with the lowest ratio of P:n-3 PUFA was dollar fish (DF) (0.28), followed by BR, ST, and vermilion snapper (range, 0.28 to 0.67). The highest ratio of P:n-3 PUFA was found in the small-tail shark (11.6). Fish with a high n-3 PUFA/g PC content were DF (41.7), BR (38.05), ST (34.8), and CF (22.5). There was a tendency of P to increase as muscle fat increased (mg P/100g), i.e., lean fish (194), semifatty fish (239), and fatty fish (262)."
3,"The regular inclusion in the diet, at least three times a week, of the species DF, BR, CF, ST, caitipa mojarra, vermillion snapper, and pot snapper can be considered beneficial to the general health status of renal patients."
0,"HIF-prolyl-hydroxylase-2 (Phd2), a member of the iron (II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family, is one of the key enzymes in hypoxia-sensing pathways. In this study, the phd2 cDNA sequence (1231bp), including an open reading frame (ORF) and encoding 358 amino acid residues was identified in Megalobrama amblycephala (Wuchang bream). The predicted Phd2 protein contained three conserved domains, MYND type zinc finger domain with critical regulatory activity, Fe(2+)-dependent 2OG-Fe (II) oxygenase superfamily domain with prolyl hydroxylase function, and P4Hc (prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha subunit homologues) domain for catalyzing proline hydroxylation. The real-time PCR results showed that phd2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all detected tissues with higher levels in the peripheral blood, heart and brain, and all embryogenesis stages, especially in mid-blastula stage. In larvae M. amblycephala, the expression trend of the phd2 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (hif-1α) mRNA was opposite during hypoxia with an increase (hypoxia for 4h) and then decrease (hypoxia for 12h) for phd2. Whereas in adult fish, the phd2 mRNA appeared a transient increase under hypoxia for 4h (DO: 3.46±0.59 mg/L), and dramatically reduced with further hypoxia exposure to 12h in the peripheral blood, muscle, head kidney, liver and brain, but showed an opposite expression trend in the heart and gill. The hif-1α expression was contrary with phd2 in the peripheral blood, while it gradually decreased in the heart, but increased in the liver with continuous hypoxia treatment. Additionally, hif-1α also showed lower mRNA levels than phd2 in all detected tissues under normoxia and hypoxia conditions. "
0,"The common carp (Cyprinus carpio) as one of the most important aquaculture fishes produces over 3 million metric tones annually, approximately 10% the annual production of the all farmed freshwater fish worldwide. However, the tetraploidy genome and long generation-time of the common carp have made its breeding and genetic studies extremely difficult. Here, TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9, two versatile genome-editing tools, are employed to target common carp bone-related genes sp7, runx2, bmp2a, spp1, opg, and muscle suppressor gene mstn. TALEN were shown to induce mutations in the target coding sites of sp7, runx2, spp1 and mstn. With CRISPR-Cas9, the two common carp sp7 genes, sp7a and sp7b, were mutated individually, all resulting in severe bone defects; while mstnba mutated fish have grown significantly more muscle cells. We also employed CRISPR-Cas9 to generate double mutant fish of sp7a;mstnba with high efficiencies in a single step. These results demonstrate that both TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9 are highly efficient tools for modifying the common carp genome, and open avenues for facilitating common carp genetic studies and breeding.

0,"Hsp70 protein in three tissue types (gill, liver, and muscle) from black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) collected in a highly variable estuarine environment was investigated to determine which tissue provides better intersite discrimination. The usefulness of hsp70 expression to identify anthropogenic stress under field conditions was evaluated. Intersite differences were detected in hsp70 levels in gill and white muscle of black bream while liver showed no spatial difference. There was high interfish variability in hsp70 levels in each tissue group. A post hoc power analysis of the datasets for each tissue found that in black bream, white muscle provided the best discriminatory power to elucidate spatial variability. Only 11 fish per site are required to identify significant intersite differences in white muscle whereas for gill and liver tissues 14 and 21 fish per site, respectively, would be required. Because of high intertissue and interindividual variability, field measurement of hsp70 should be complemented by evidence of changes in other biomarkers of fish health."
0,"Edwardsiella tarda is a rod-shaped Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium that causes hemorrhagic septicemia in fish. Nucleoid-associated protein HU is a basic DNA-binding protein with structural specificity in regulating genes expression. In wild-type E. tarda EIB202, HU is composed of two subunits HUα (hupA) and HUβ (hupB), and exists in homodimer or heterodimer forms. Different from the wild-type and ΔhupB mutant, ΔhupA mutant was found to be defective in cell growth, H2S production, acid adaptation, and exhibited abnormal cell division resulting in a filamentous phenotype in log phase bacteria. The qRT-PCR result showed that deletion of hupA significantly up-regulated the transcription levels of recA and sulA, which in turn stimulated RecA-dependent pathway to prevent cell division, resulting in filamentous morphology in E. tarda. Furthermore, the elongated ΔhupA cells showed a striking defect in EPC cell invasion, and the adhesion and internalization rates were reduced to 25% and 27% of the wild-type in log phase cultures. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that filamentous bacteria failed to adhere to and could not be internalized into EPC. When some of the bacteria regained the rod-shape morphology in stationary cultures, the ΔhupA mutants showed increased adhesion and internalization rates into EPC. Moreover, ΔhupA mutant exhibited delayed mortalities (for two days) in zebrafish but the LD50 increased 17 folds. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that ΔhupA mutant reduced proliferation abilities in the muscle, liver and intestine of zebrafish. This study indicates that HU protein and strains morphology play essential roles in the virulence network of E. tarda. "
0,"A cell line, WE-spleen6, has been developed from the stromal layer of primary spleen cell cultures. On conventional plastic, WE-spleen6 cells had a spindle-shaped morphology at low cell density but grew to become epithelial-like at confluency. On the commercial extracellular matrix (ECM), Matrigel, the cells remained spindle-shaped and formed lumen-like structures. WE-spleen6 cells had intermediate filament protein, vimentin and the ECM protein, collagen I, but not smooth muscle α-actin (SMA) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) and lacked alkaline phosphatase and phagocytic activities. WE-spleen6 was more susceptible to infection with VHSV IVb than a fibroblast and epithelial cell lines from the walleye caudal fin, WE-cfin11f and WE-cfin11e, respectively. Viral transcripts and proteins appeared earlier in WE-spleen6 cultures as did cytopathic effect (CPE) and significant virus production. The synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (pIC), induced the antiviral protein Mx in both cell lines. Treating WE-spleen6 cultures with pIC prior to infection with VHSV IVb inhibited the early accumulation of viral transcripts and proteins and delayed the appearance of CPE and significant viral production. Of particular note, pIC caused the disappearance of viral P protein 2 days post infection. WE-spleen6 should be useful for investigating the impact of VHSV IVb on hematopoietic organs and the actions of pIC on the rhabdovirus life cycle. "
0,"Newborns of diabetic mothers have abnormal circulatory organs, so in this study, we explore insulin signaling in the newborn rat heart."
1,"Pregnant rats were divided into streptozotocin-induced diabetic groups (DM) and control groups (CM). Rats were fed lard (21% fat), fish oil (21% fat), or a control diet (7% fat). To examine changes in insulin signaling in the hearts of infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) in relation to diet, we isolated the hearts from the IDM and control infants and determined the phosphorylation levels of Akt308, Akt473, p38, c-jun-NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), and the expression levels of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kainase1 (PDK1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)."
2,"The mean blood glucose levels in the DM group and their infants were significantly higher than those in the CM group (P < 0.05) and their infants (P < 0.05), but the mean blood glucose levels of all infants was normal on postnatal d 4. Phosphorylation levels of Akt (Thr 308) (P < 0.05) and Akt (Ser 473) and the expression levels of PDK1 and mTOR were lower in infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) than in control infants. The phosphorylation level of Akt (Ser 473) and the expression level of mTOR increased in IDM fed the fish oil diet compared with those fed the lard diet (P < 0.05)."

0,"Considering the excessive lipid accumulation status caused by the increased dietary lipid intake in farmed fish, this study aimed to investigate the systemic effect of dietary lipid levels and α-lipoic acid supplementation on nutritional metabolism in zebrafish. A total of 540 male zebrafish (0.17 g) were fed with normal (CT) and high lipid level (HL) diets for 6 weeks, then fed on 1000 mg/kg α-lipoic acid supplementation diets for the second 6 weeks. HL diets did not affect whole fish protein content, but increased ASNS expression (P < 0.05). Dietary α-lipoic acid increased whole fish protein content, and decreased the expressions of protein catabolism-related genes in muscle of high lipid level groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, HL diets increased the whole fish lipid content and the expressions of gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis-related genes (P < 0.05), and α-lipoic acid counteracted these effects and decreased the whole fish triglyceride and cholesterol contents and expressions of lipogenesis-related genes, with the enhanced expressions of lipolytic genes, especially in high lipid groups (P < 0.05). HL diets did not affect hepatocyte mitochondrial quantity or the mRNA expressions of mitochondrial biogenesis and electron transport chain-related genes; they were significantly increased by dietary α-lipoic acid (P < 0.05). These results indicated that high dietary lipid promotes lipid accumulation, while α-lipoic acid increases protein content in association of enhanced lipid catabolism. Thus, dietary α-lipoic acid supplementation could reduce lipid accumulation under high lipid, which provides a promising new approach in solving the problem of lipid accumulation in farmed fish."
0,"Contusion injury in aging muscle has not been studied in detail, but older adults are at risk for such injuries due to increased risk of falls. As falls in older populations are unlikely to be eliminated, interventions to minimize the negative impact of falls, including contusion injury should be pursued. Dietary fish oil (FO) is a common often supplement in older adults, which is associated with factors that might reduce or worsen the negative impact of contusion."
1,"Here, we investigate whether 8 weeks of FO can blunt the impact of contusion injury in adult (n = 14) and aged (n = 12) rats. We assessed contractility and several biochemical markers in adult and aged gastrocnemius muscles 48 h post-contusion injury, using the uninjured muscles as controls."
2,"Injury reduced force production ~40% (P < 0.001), sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release by ~20% (P = 0.003) and significantly increased several markers of muscle damage (i.e., protein carbonyls, Grp78 abundance (P = 0.022, 0.006, respectively)), and these injury-related changes were not affected by aging. The effects of FO were limited. A main effect (P = 0.018) for FO to increase the myogenic factor Myf5 was observed. In addition FO reduced the injury-associated decline in the mitophagy factor DRP1 (P = 0.027)."
3,"Although age-related differences in certain protein markers differed, aged muscles exhibited no greater acute functional deficits following injury. Similarly, while FO did not reduce functional deficits, it did not worsen them. However, changes in Myf5 and DRP1 with dietary FO suggest the potential to improve recovery from contusion injury, which should be investigated in future studies."
0,"Some technological and food processing treatments applied to parasitized fish kill the Anisakis larvae and prevent infection and sensitization of consumers. However, residual allergenic activity of parasite allergens has been shown. The aim here was to study the effect of different heat treatments used in the fish canning processing industry on the antigen recognition of Anisakis L3. Bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) were experimentally infected with live L3 Anisakis. After 48 h at 5 ± 1 °C, brine was added to the muscle, which was then canned raw (live larvae) or heated (90 °C, 30 min) (dead larvae) and treated at 113 °C for 60 min or at 115 °C for 90 min. Anisakis antigens and Ani s 4 were detected with anti-crude extract and anti-Ani s 4 antisera respectively."
1,"Ani s 4 decreased in all lots, but the muscle retained part of the allergenicity irrespective of the canning method, as observed by immunohistochemistry. Dot blot analysis showed a high loss of Ani s 4 recognition after canning, but residual antigenicity was present."
2,The results indicate that heat treatment for sterilization under the conditions studied produces a decrease in Ani s 4 and suggest a potential exposure risk for Anisakis-sensitized patients.
0,"The H (hypothalamic)-P (pituitary)-I (interrenal) axis plays a critical role in the fish stress response and is regulated by several factors. Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most toxic heavy metals in the world, but its effects on the H-P-I axis of teleosts are largely unknown. Using rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) as an experimental animal, we found that Cd only disrupted the secretion and synthesis of cortisol. Neither hormones at the H or P level nor the expressions of their receptor genes (corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR) and melanocortin receptor 2 (MC2R)) were affected. Steroidogenic acute regulator (StAR), CYP11A1 and CYP11B1, which encode the key enzymes in the cortisol synthesis pathway, were significantly up-regulated in the kidney (including the head kidney). The level of 11β-HSD2, which is required for the conversion of cortisol to cortisone, was increased in the kidney, intestine, brain, and hepatopancreas, whereas the expression of 11β-HSD1, which encodes the reverse conversion enzyme, was increased in the gill, kidney and almost unchanged in other tissues. The enzyme activity concentration of 11β-HSD2 was increased in the kidney as well. The level of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) decreased in the intestine, gill and muscle, and the key GR regulator FK506 binding protein5 (FKBP5) was up-regulated in the GR-decreased tissues, whereas the level of nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (NCoR1), another GR regulator remained almost unchanged. Thus, GR, FKBP5 and 11β-HSD2 may be involved in Cd-induced cortisol disruption. "
0,"Supplies of marine fish oils are limited, and continued growth in aquaculture production dictates that lipid substitutes in fish diets must be used without compromising fish health and product quality. In this study, the total substitution of a fish meal and fish oil by a blend of vegetable meals (corn, soybean, wheat and lupin) and linseed oil in the diet of European sea bass (Dicentrachus labrax) was investigated. Two groups of European sea bass were fed with fish diet (FD) or vegetable diet (VD) for 9months. VD, totally deprived of eicosapentaenoate (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoate (DHA; 22:6n-3), revealed a nutritional deficiency and affected growth performance. Whilst VD induced a significant increase in fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) and sterol binding regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) mRNA levels, the desaturation rate of [1-(14)C]18:3n-3 into [1-(14)C]18:4n-3, analysed in microsomal preparations using HPLC method, did not show an upregulation of FADS2 activities in liver and intestine of fish fed VD. Moreover Western-blot analysis did not revealed any significant difference of FADS2 protein amount between the two dietary groups. These data demonstrate that sea bass exhibits a desaturase (FADS2) activity whatever their diet, but a post-transcriptional regulation of fads2 RNA prevents an increase of enzyme in fish fed a HUFA-free diet. This led to a lower fish growth and poor muscle HUFA content."
0,"The potential of MALDI-TOF MS was investigated in terms of its capability to determine the change of exudates of fish muscle with different freeze-thaw cycles (0, 1 and 2), and frozen storage periods. The exudates were collected from dead chilled marine fish species, large yellow croacker (Larimichthys crocea, LC) and freshly slaughtered freshwater fish species, Japanese seabass (Lateolabrax japonicus) to be studied as models. 109 proteins, in which, 32 are extracellular proteins, and 15 are intracellular proteins, were identified by analyzing exudate of LC using MALDI-TOF MS and HPLC-MS/MS. The results show that the present method may be able to determine the change of fish muscle foods in a more sensitive mode than K value indicated quality control. The feasibility of verifying the storage situation of fish sample was performed by analyzing fish samples obtained from the local market. It is promising to estimate the storage situation of fishery products or other animal muscle foods by analyzing their muscle exudates based on the presently developed strategy."
0,"Living without oxygen is limited to very few vertebrates, one species being the fresh water fish crucian carp (Carassius carassius), which can survive months of anoxia at low temperatures. Mammalian heart and brain are particularly intolerant to oxygen deprivation, yet these organs can be conditioned to display increased resistance, possibly due to activation of several protein kinases. We hypothesized increased phosphorylation status of these kinases in hypoxic and anoxic crucian carp heart and brain. Moreover, we wanted to investigate whether the kinases showing the strongest phosphorylation during hypoxia/anoxia, ERK 1/2, p38-MAPK, JNK, PKCε, and PKCδ, also had increased expression and phosphorylation at cold temperatures, to better cope with the anoxic periods during winter. We found small differences in the phosphorylation status of ERK 1/2, p38-MAPK, JNK, PKCε, and PKCδ during 10 days of severe hypoxia in both heart and brain (0.3 mg O₂/l) and varying responses to reoxygenation. In contrast, 7 days of anoxia (<0.01 mg O₂/l) markedly increased phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, p38-MAPK, JNK in the heart, and p38-MAPK and PKCε in the brain. Similarly, varying acclimation temperature between 4, 10 and 20°C induced large changes in phosphorylation status. Total protein expression in heart and brain neither changed during different oxygen regimes nor with different acclimation temperatures, except for ERK 1/2, which slightly decreased in the heart at 4°C compared with 20°C. A phylogenetic analysis confirmed that these protein kinases are evolutionarily conserved across a wide range of vertebrate species. Our findings indicate important roles of several protein kinases during oxygen deprivation."
0,"In order to investigate the metabolic regulation in Atlantic salmon fries (Salmo salar L.) during their growth, development, and in the course of size divergence, age-related changes in the activity of enzymes involved in the energy and carbohydrate metabolism, including myosin heavy chain isoform expression, RNA/DNA ratio in the white muscles and liver of specimens at ages of 0+; 1+, and 2+, as well as correlations of these characteristics with the body weight of fish specimens were analyzed. Multidirectional changes in the activity of enzymes taking part in aerobic and anaerobic energy metabolism, as well as a decrease in the protein synthesis with age, were revealed. There was a positive correlation between the activities of cytochrome oxidase, lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase, and myosin gene expression in the muscles, cytochrome oxidase activity, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the liver with the body weight of salmon specimens within the age groups."
0,"Dietary fat plays a major role in obesity, lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases. To determine whether the intake of different types of dietary fats affect the muscle fiber types that govern the metabolic and contractile properties of the skeletal muscle, we fed male Wistar rats with a 15% fat diet derived from different fat sources. Diets composed of soybean oil (n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-rich), fish oil (n-3 PUFA-rich), or lard (low in PUFAs) were administered to the rats for 4 weeks. Myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms were used as biomarkers to delineate the skeletal muscle fiber types. Compared with soybean oil intake, fish oil intake showed significantly lower levels of the fast-type MyHC2B and higher levels of the intermediate-type MyHC2X composition in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, which is a fast-type dominant muscle. Concomitantly, MyHC2X mRNA levels in fish oil-fed rats were significantly higher than those observed in the soybean oil-fed rats. The MyHC isoform composition in the lard-fed rats was an intermediate between that of the fish oil and soybean oil-fed rats. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, and porin mRNA showed significantly upregulated levels in the EDL of fish oil-fed rats compared to those observed in soybean oil-fed and lard-fed rats, implying an activation of oxidative metabolism. In contrast, no changes in the composition of MyHC isoforms was observed in the soleus muscle, which is a slow-type dominant muscle. Fatty acid composition in the serum and the muscle was significantly influenced by the type of dietary fat consumed. In conclusion, dietary fat affects the expression of genes related to the contractile and metabolic properties in the fast-type dominant skeletal muscle, where the activation of oxidative metabolism is more pronounced after fish oil intake than that after soybean oil intake.

0,"The rods of anti-parallel myosin molecules overlap at the centre of bipolar myosin filaments to produce an M-region (bare zone) that is free of myosin heads. Beyond the M-region edges, myosin molecules aggregate in a parallel fashion to yield the bridge regions of the myosin filaments. Adjacent myosin filaments in striated muscle A-bands are cross-linked by the M-band. Vertebrate striated muscle myosin filaments have a 3-fold rotational symmetry around their long axes. In addition, at the centre of the M-region, there are three 2-fold axes perpendicular to the filament long axis, giving the whole filament dihedral 32-point group symmetry. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure obtained by a single-particle analysis of the M-region of myosin filaments from goldfish skeletal muscle under relaxing conditions and as viewed in negative stain. This is the first single-particle reconstruction of isolated M-regions. The resulting three-dimensional reconstruction reveals details to about 55 Å resolution of the density distribution in the five main nonmyosin densities in the M-band (M6', M4', M1, M4 and M6) and in the myosin head crowns (P1, P2 and P3) at the M-region edges. The outermost crowns in the reconstruction were identified specifically by their close similarity to the corresponding crown levels in our previously published bridge region reconstructions. The packing of myosin molecules into the M-region structure is discussed, and some unidentified densities are highlighted."
0,"Seven deep-sea fish species were sampled in the Blanes Canyon area (NW Mediterranean) at a depth of 1200 m during winter. The concentrations of nine metals were determined in the liver of these species by ICP-MS. Furthermore, the metal detoxification potential was determined for each species by analysing the hepatic metallothionein (MT) content, relations between metals and the molar ratio between MT and/or selected metals. The potential effect of metal content on their physiology was assessed using general stress markers such as the enzyme activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in muscle. Levels of metals in the seven Mediterranean deep-sea fish species studied were intermediate to equivalent species of fish either from Atlantic waters or hydrothermal vents. The metal detoxification potential varied among species depending on MT, selenium (Se) or zinc (Zn) as reliable mechanisms to handle potential metal toxicity. The role of Se was especially relevant when the liver content of mercury (Hg) was higher. AChE and LDH activities did seem to be affected by metal loads and thus the activities reported would correspond to baseline activities of the selected species."
0,"A major development in fishery science has been the Fulton's condition factor (CF) as a reliable physiological index of fish growth and health status (Fulton 1902). As a general rule, CF-value greater than 1 (>1) should be regarded as an indicator for good growth and health. Therefore, exposure of fish to contaminants in the environment will be expected to produce a reduction in scope for growth, since energy for growth will be allocated to overcome stressful conditions. In the present study, we hypothesized that tilapia species from Ogun River (Nigeria) are experiencing severe contaminant-induced obesogen effects leading to high CF (≥ 2) in fish with pathological alterations. The environmental obesogen hypothesis has related the interaction between environmental pollutants and PPAR isoform activation In this respect, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and biotransformation responses in relation to contaminant burden were investigated in a total of 1074 specimens of Tilapias species (Tilapia guineensis, Sarotherodon galileaus and Oreochromis niloticus) collected from three areas with different degrees of anthropogenic contamination and from a putative control site along the Ogun River. Liver mRNA expression of cytochrome cyp1 isoforms (cyp1a, 1b and 1c) and PPAR isoforms (ppar-α, β and γ) were analyzed using validated real-time PCR. Fish were also analyzed for CF and muscle contaminant burden (aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls). A significant increase in mRNA expression of cyp1- and ppar isoforms was observed in fish from polluted areas, and these results paralleled data on PCBs and PAHs tissue concentrations. Further, cyp1 isoforms showed clear sex-related differences, with higher mRNA expression in male fish than in females. Principal component analysis revealed a relationship between cyp1 isoforms, ppar-α, β, PCBs and PAHs and these interactions may suggest a crosstalk between AhR- and PPARs mediated pathways on metabolic and energetic processes. The PCA biplot also highlighted a positive relationship between ppar-γ, body weight, total length and PAHs. The CF for fish from all the sites was ≥ 2 indicating that this parameter may not be a reliable index for evaluating fish growth and health condition, especially in wild fish population exposed to complex cocktails of environmental pollutants."
0,"Selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) were added at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg per kg diet to assess its effects on the performance, Se bioaccumulation, blood health, and antioxidant status of red sea bream. After 45 days, Se-NPs positively impacted the growth and feed efficiency of red sea bream especially by 1 mg per kg diet. No significant (P > 0.05) changes in survival and somatic indices were noticed among groups. Dietary Se-NPs significantly (P < 0.05) increased the protein, lipid, and Se contents in the whole body, muscle, and liver tissues, whereas decreasing the whole-body moisture content of treated groups compared with the Se-NP-free group. Using of Se-NPs at 2 mg per kg diet resulted in the highest Se content in the complete body, muscle, and liver. Significantly enhanced intestine protease activity and hematocrit levels accompanied with low cholesterol and triglyceride were observed in fish fed Se-NP-enriched diets. Fish fed on Se-NPs at 0.5, 1, and 2 mg Se-NPs per kg diet exhibited significantly higher values of biological antioxidant potential than the control group (P < 0.05). Therefore, the obtained results recommends adding 1 mg Se-NPs per kg diet to improve the growth, feed efficiency, blood health, and antioxidant defense system of red sea bream."
0,"The protein extract of Etroplus suratensis (E. suratensis) collected from Bavanisagar dam was found to be effective against all tested organisms with an inhibition zone ranging from 0.2 to 1.9 mm. When the result was compared with standard antibiotic Streptomycin, a moderate efficiency was observed. In vitro, an antibacterial assay was used to assess the efficacy of fish protein in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbes. The fish protein of E. suratensis collected from Bavanisagar had a broad spectrum of antibacterial potential. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of E. suratensis against pathogens are the highest in protein collected from Bavanisagar. In the fish protein collected from Bavanisagar, it has been shown that the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) value is higher in Bacillus subtilis (0.85/20 µg/ml) and the lowest in Micrococcus (0.1/100 µg/ml). The sub-lethal dose of fish protein was estimated at 1/10 of 96 h LD50 dose (30 µg/ml/Kg), the antibody response was significantly enhanced on day 14 and day 21 (p < 0.01). The highest IgG level was noticed on day 21, which decreased towards day 28. This result showed the antibody production with an increased IgG concentration. The above results demonstrate that fish protein extracts have great potential as immunostimulants against the microorganisms and they can be used in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by the microorganisms.

0,"Few studies have addressed the impact of the upwelling oceanographical conditions on biological processes, such as growth, using a molecular and physiological approach. Upwelling conditions are characterized by low temperature seawater and high nutrient availability, which represents an ideal opportunity to understand how habitat modulates animal performance at different levels of biological complexity. We aimed to assess intraspecific variations in weight, oxygen consumption, protein content, and key signaling pathways involved in muscle-growth (protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)) under experimental trials considering high/low seawater temperatures with full/restricted food rations. For this purpose, we studied Girella laevifrons, one of the most abundant fish species inhabiting rocky intertidal zones along the Eastern South Pacific coasts. Using fish obtained from upwelling (U) and non-upwelling (NU) zones, we reported that U animals displayed higher growth performance during both contrasting trials, with a weight gain (~3 g), lower oxygen consumption (~12%), and higher protein contents (~20%). Only ERK showed significant differences during the trials (~2-fold downregulation between NU and U fish). We also found that U fish increased protein ubiquitination in high water temperature and restricted food ration in contrast to NU fish. Our results help to elucidate how upwelling conditions may influence fish growth at physiological and molecular levels. Still, future analyses are necessary to improve the information regarding the impact of U and NU condition on animals, as well as the possible applications of this data in the aquaculture industry."
0,"This study was designed to evaluate the physiological and immune responses of juvenile turbot to stocking density. Turbot (average weight 185.4g) were reared for 120days in a land based recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) under three stocking densities: low density (LD, ~9.3-26.1kg/m<sup>2</sup>, initial to final density), medium density (MD, ~13.6-38.2kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and high density (HD, ~19.1-52.3kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Fish were sampled at days 0, 40, 80 and 120 to obtain growth parameters and liver tissues. No significant difference was detected in growth, biochemical parameters and gene expression among the three densities until at the final sampling (day 120). At the end of this trial, fish reared in HD group showed lower specific growth rate (SGR) and mean weight than those reared in LD and MD groups. Similarly, oxidative stress and metabolism analyses represented that antioxidants (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH)) and metabolic enzymes (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH)) clearly reduced in the liver of turbot reared in HD group. The gene expression data showed that glutathione S-transferase (GST), cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A), heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) and metallothionein (MT) mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated, and lysozyme (LYS) and hepcidin (HAMP) mRNA levels were significantly down-regulated in HD group on day 120. Overall, our results indicate that overly high stocking density might block the activities of metabolic and antioxidant enzymes, and cause physiological stress and immunosuppression in turbot."
0,"Sodium selenite was added to basal diet at five levels (0.10, 0.42, 0.67, 1.06 and 1.46 mg Se/kg) and fed fish for 8 weeks. The dietary selenium requirement of juvenile blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) was quantified. Dietaryseleniums at 0.67-1.06 mg Se/kg improved weight gain rate, specific growth rate and feed efficiency. The optimal amount was 0.96 mg/kg, for which the specific growth rate was 1.798%/day and the weight gain rate was 173.852% (p < 0.05). Se deposition in muscle was increased (p < 0.05) at ≥0.67 mg/kg, but moisture, protein, lipid and ash content were not affected. Physiological status and lipid metabolism were improved by 1.06-1.46 mg/kg dietary selenium based on total protein and albumin in plasma, and total cholesterol and triglycerides (p < 0.05). Activities of hepatic anti-oxidant enzymes catalase, total superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione were enhanced at Se1.06 (p < 0.05). However, malondialdehyde content was lowered at Se1.06 (p < 0.05). Expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1) in liver were elevated at Se1.06 (p < 0.05), as were mRNA levels of glutathione peroxidase, copper zinc superoxide dismutase and catalase. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 8, tumour necrosis factor-α and transforming growth factor-β were inhibited at 0.67-1.46 mg/kg (p < 0.05). In general, 0.96 mg/kg was optimal, and optimal selenium enhanced antioxidant stress tolerance and anti-inflammatory ability."
0,"Thermal stress, encountered frequently in aquaculture, affects diverse physiological processes and behavior of fish; however, the mechanism underlying these effects may vary among species. Half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) widely inhabits Asian coastal waters and has been intensively cultured in China. In this study, the transcriptomes of three tissues (gill, liver and muscle) of half-smooth tongue sole stressed at temperatures up to 35°C were profiled and compared with those of the fish living at a normal temperature of 25°C. Of 105,228 transcripts, 23,213 were annotated in GO terms, and 718, 1236 and 561 were found to express differentially in gill, liver and muscle from control, respectively. Of the differentially expressed genes, 119 were shared by all three tissues. Tissue-overlapping transcripts and the pathways and functions they defined may underline the primary response of fish to thermostressing. High temperature may cause directly protein mis-folding and hypoxia. Cells suffering thermostress either survive hypoxia or are eliminated by immune system. High temperature may have interacted indirectly through HSPs with HIF-1 and JAKs/STATs signaling pathways. The former up-regulates the expression of hypoxia inducible genes while the later up-regulates the expression of genes associating with insulin and NOD-like receptors signaling pathways. Insulin pathway functions to sustain homeostasis of sugar and lipids, aiding to survive cells, while NOD-like receptors signaling pathway strengthens immune, apoptotic and inflammatory responses, helping to survive cells. These understandings may help improve our culturing practice, the culture performance of half-smooth tongue sole and its breeding. "
0,"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), exhibit antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, diets rich in n-3 PUFAs are known to improve disease resistance and limit pathogen infection in commercial aquaculture fishes. In this study, we examined the effects of transgenic overexpression of n-3 PUFA biosynthesis genes on the physiological response to bacterial infection in tilapia. We first established tilapia strains with single or dual expression of salmon delta-5 desaturase and/or delta-6 desaturase and then challenged the fish with Vibrio vulnificus infection. Interestingly, our data suggest that n-3 PUFA-mediated alterations in gut microbiota may be important in determining disease outcome via effects on immune response of the host. Both liver- and muscle-specific single and dual expression of delta-5 desaturase and delta-6 desaturase resulted in higher n-3 PUFA content in transgenic fish fed with a LO basal diet. The enrichment of n-3 PUFAs in dual-transgenic fish is likely responsible for their improved survival rate and comparatively reduced expression of inflammation- and immune-associated genes after V. vulnificus infection. Gut microbiome analysis further revealed that dual-transgenic tilapia had high gut microbiota diversity, with low levels of inflammation-associated microbiota (i.e., Prevotellaceae). Thus, our findings indicate that dual expression of transgenic delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase in tilapia enhances disease resistance, an effect that is associated with increased levels of n-3 PUFAs and altered gut microbiota composition."
0,"At a resting sarcomere length of approximately 2.2 µm bony fish muscles put into rigor in the presence of BDM (2,3-butanedione monoxime) to reduce rigor tension generation show the normal arrangement of myosin head interactions with actin filaments as monitored by low-angle X-ray diffraction. However, if the muscles are put into rigor using the same protocol but stretched to 2.5 µm sarcomere length, a markedly different structure is observed. The X-ray diffraction pattern is not just a weaker version of the pattern at full overlap, as might be expected, but it is quite different. It is compatible with the actin-attached myosin heads being in a different conformation on actin, with the average centre of cross-bridge mass at a higher radius than in normal rigor and the myosin lever arms conforming less to the actin filament geometry, probably pointing back to their origins on their parent myosin filaments. The possible nature of this new rigor cross-bridge conformation is discussed in terms of other well-known states such as the weak binding state and the 'roll and lock' mechanism; we speculate that we may have trapped most myosin heads in an early attached strong actin-binding state in the cross-bridge cycle on actin."
0,"Histological and Immunohistochemical studies were carried out to document the possible impact of heavy metal contamination in different tissues of Chanos chanos. Heavy metals such as Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Mn and Fe were predominant in water, sediment and biota of Kaattuppalli Island and varied significantly between two different sites. Histological changes such as swelling of muscle fiber and break down of muscle bundles were noted in the muscle. Similarly gill filament cell proliferation, increase in intercellular spaces and primary and secondary lamellar epithelium were evident in gills. The hepatocytes showed damage of central vein and rupture of irregular hepatic plate with more number of vacuoles in the fish collected from polluted site compared to that from the less polluted site. The impact of pollution was also assessed in different tissues by immunohistochemistry using primary antibody (mouse monoclonal HSP70 antibody 1:2000) and secondary antibody (HRP conjugated antibody) for expression of stress protein. Immunostaining analysis showed expression of HSP70 with high intensity in the tissues of fish collected from polluted site compared to less polluted sites. Further, HSP70 positive cells were analyzed from six locations per fish tissue section. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by least significant difference (LSD) was used to check if the expression was significant. Results indicate that the values are statistically significant at the two different sampling sites (P<0.05)."
0,"<b>:</b> Protein denaturation in frozen minced fillets (<i>Ehrenberg's Snapper</i>), stored at -25°C was studied; 50.0 mg biomass/50g mince fillets treated with cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, garlic, ginger and 25.0 mg of vitamin C were used to slow protein denaturation. FT-IR stretching vibration of Amide-A (νNH) at 3300 cm<sup>-1</sup>; Amide-I stretching (νC=O) between 1600-1690 cm<sup>-1</sup> and Amide-II stretching (νCN) and bending (δNH) between 1480 and 1575cm<sup>-1</sup> were used as marker peaks. Garlic was the most significant (P ≤0.01) in controlling the rate of protein denaturation when νNH was used as a marker peak. DSC analysis showed that turmeric presented the highest effect on delaying the denaturation of sarcoplasmic proteins with a ∆H0=73.7J/g followed by garlic-treated mince fillets ∆H0=70.1J/g. All spices used were efficient in stopping the denaturation of myosin with the highest ∆H0=769.3 J/g registered for cinnamon-treated mince fillets. Actin was less vulnerable to denaturation in comparison to myosin and sarcoplasmic proteins."
0,"Human bitter taste receptor TAS2R14 (T2R14) can widely perceive bitterness, which has always been an issue for people to overcome. This study was aimed at identifying bioactive peptides obtained from Oncorhynchus mykiss nebulin hydrolysates as bitter taste receptor blockers by physicochemical property prediction, molecular docking, and in vitro determination of bitterness intensity using electronic tongue. Exploration of the interaction mechanism of these peptides with T2R14 by molecular docking models indicated that peptides ADM and ADW had high affinities for T2R14 to block the binding of bitter substances into the receptor. Addition of ADM and ADW to quinine caused reduction in bitterness intensity, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 420.32 ± 6.26 μM and 403.29 ± 4.10 μM, respectively. Hydrogen bond interaction and hydrophobic interaction were responsible for manifesting the high affinities of these peptides for the receptor. Residues Thr86, Asp168, and Phe247 may be the key amino acids within the binding site."
0,"The heart is considered the powerhouse of the cardiovascular system. Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI), cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) and pancreas disease (PD) are cardiac diseases of marine farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) which commonly affect the heart in addition to the skeletal muscle, liver and pancreas. The main findings of these diseases are necrosis and inflammatory cells infiltrates affecting different regions of the heart. In order to better characterize the cardiac pathology, study of the inflammatory cell characteristics and cell cycle protein expression was undertaken by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin embedded hearts from confirmed diseased cases applying specific antibodies. The inflammatory cells were predominantly CD3(+) T lymphocytes. The PD diseased hearts exhibited moderate hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) immuno-reaction that suggested tissue hypoxia while recombinant tumor necrosis factor-α (rTNFα) antibody identified putative macrophages and eosinophilic granulocytes (EGCs) in addition to endocardial cells around lesions. There were strong to low levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II immunostaining in the diseased hearts associated with macrophage-like and lymphocyte-like cells. The diseased hearts expressed strong to low levels of apoptotic cells identified by caspase 3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The strong signals for proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and TUNEL, and moderate levels of caspase 3 immuno-reactivity suggested a high cell turnover where DNA damage/repair might be occurring in the diseased hearts. Interestingly, the apparently similar cardiac diseases exhibited differences in the immunopathological responses in Atlantic salmon."
0,"Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) was applied to investigate the impact of slaughtering on the postmortem integrity of muscle tissue proteins in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Three different slaughtering techniques were evaluated: asphyxia in air (AA), asphyxia in ice (AI), and spinal cord severance (SCS). Principal components analysis (PCA) revealed a significant divergence of SCS samples, whereas AA and AI samples, although grouped separately, were less divergent and could be included in a single asphyxia cluster. In terms of single proteins, the most significant impact was seen on nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, which was consistently less affected when fish were slaughtered by SCS as compared to asphyxia. Integrity of the sarcomeric proteins myosin heavy chain and myosin binding protein C and of the cytosolic proteins fructose biphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enolase 1 was also better preserved upon SCS slaughtering. Most interestingly, the influence on muscle protein integrity could be detected since the early postmortem phase. In conclusion, slaughtering by SCS preserves protein integrity better than death by asphyxia, either in ice or in air. Both asphyxia conditions are comparably more adverse than SCS to muscle protein integrity, although a general trend favoring AI over AA is observed."
0,"The study mainly aimed at the effects of dietary Senecio scandens buch-ham extract (SSBE) on the growth performance, body composition, plasma biochemical index, intestinal and liver histology and the expression of antioxidant, apoptosis and inflammatory related genes in hybrid grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus♂ × Epinephelus fuscoguttatus♀). Basal diets supplemented with SSBE (10:1) 0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.4% were fed hybrid grouper for 8 weeks. The results showed that WGR and SGR were significantly increased in the week 2 and week 4 in Diet 0.05% group (P < 0.05). The total protein, globulin and albumin significantly increased whereas alanine aminotransferase, triglyceride and alkaline phosphate in the plasma were significantly decreased in Diet 0.1% group (P < 0.05). The villi length, width, muscle thickness and the cross-sectional area of intestine were improved in Diet 0.05% and Diet 0.1% group. The expression levels of PPAR-α and CPT-1 in the liver of hybrid grouper were significantly increased following the supplementation of SSBE (P < 0.05). The expression levels of antioxidant related genes (CAT, GPX, GR and Keap1) and anti-inflammatory factor (IL-10) in liver, head kidney and spleen of hybrid grouper decreased significantly (P < 0.05). In addition, diets supplemented with 0.05%-0.1% SSBE had a good liver-protecting effect, but it would have a detrimental effect on hepatocytes when the content exceeds 0.2%. The above results indicated that the suitable additive amount of SSBE in hybrid grouper feed was 0.05%-0.1%."
0,"Doublesex and Mab3 related transcription factor (DMRT), characterized by a conserved DM domain, function as sex-related transcription factors and also play critical roles in ontogenesis. In this study, 4 Dmrt genes in the blunt snout bream, Megalobrama amblycephala, were identified, characterized and their mRNA expression in different adult organs, during embryogenesis and gonadal development in larvae were determined by quantitative real time PCR. There are 4 Dmrt1 isoforms in the M. amblycephala genome, which were expressed highly in the testis and weakly in the ovary. The complete cDNAs of the M. amblycephala Dmrt2a, Dmrt2b and Dmrt3 were predicted to encode 510, 328 and 449 amino acids, respectively. The M. amblycephala Dmrt2a mRNA peaked at 11hpf (hour post fertilizing) during early embryonic stages, while Dmrt2b was highly expressed during late embryonic stages. Both the M. amblycephala Dmrt2a and Dmrt2b were expressed highly in the gill and exhibited a sexually dimorphic expression pattern. The M. amblycephala Dmrt3 was expressed highly in the gill, muscle and brain, at 40dph (day post hatching) during early development and at stage V in the testis during gonadal development. All fish Dmrts except Dmrt5 were found in the M. amblycephala genome. The observed expression patterns of these Dmrts in developing embryos and larvae, as well as different adult organs indicate conserved sexual or extragonadal functions of the Dmrts through evolution.

0,"Tissue factor pathway inhibitors (TFPIs) are Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors that reversibly regulate the blood coagulation induced by tissue factor. TFPI family contain two members, TFPI-1 and TFPI-2. Recent studies have shown TFPI-1 and TFPI-2 also play important roles in innate immunity, however, the potential function of teleost TFPI are very limited. In this study, we characterized two TFPI (CsTFPI-1 and CsTFPI-2) molecules from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), examined their tissue distributions and expression patterns under pathogens stimulation as well as investigated the antibacterial activity of the C-terminal peptides. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis showed that constitutive CsTFPI-1 expression occurred, in increasing order, in head kidney, intestine, brain, spleen, liver, skin, gills, heart, and muscle; CsTFPI-2 was expressed, in increasing order, in the gills, intestine, skin, head kidney, liver, brain, spleen, muscle, and heart. Under Vibrio anguillarum, Streptococcus agalactiae and fish megalocytivirus stimulation, both CsTFPI-1 and CsTFPI-2 expression increased significantly in a manner that depended on the pathogen, tissue type, and infection stage, which suggested CsTFPI-1 and CsTFPI-2 play important roles in anti-bacterial and anti-viral infection. Finally, C-terminal peptides of CsTFPI-1 and CsTFPI-2, were synthesized and proved to have antibacterial effect against Micrococcus luteus that were independent of host serum. Take together, these results indicate that CsTFPI-1 and CsTFPI-2 play important roles in antimicrobial immunity of this fish."
0,"Analysis of electrophoregrams of water-soluble proteins of white skeletal muscle of 10 fish species belonging to three genera of the Acipenseridae family has allowed revealing an earlier not described system that can serve as a biochemical marker. This protein system represents a set of five fractions (A, B, C, D, E). A part of the studied species is monomorphous for one of these fractions (sterlet, starred sturgeon, great sturgeon, and big shovelnose had phenotype A, barbel sturgeon--phenotype C, great Siberian sturgeon--phenotype D). In all individuals of the Amur sturgeon the identical three-component specter (phenotype ACE) was revealed. In the Sakhalin, Siberian, and Russian sturgeons a clearly expressed polymorphism was observed. Among the studied species the Russian sturgeon was characterized by the highest degree of heterogeneity and polymorphism. In the studied sample of this species all five protein variants are found, whereas in other species--only a part of this set."
0,"Rates of aerobic metabolism vary considerably across evolutionary lineages, but little is known about the proximate and ultimate factors that generate and maintain this variability. Using data for 131 teleost fish species, we performed a large-scale phylogenetic comparative analysis of how interspecific variation in resting metabolic rates (RMRs) and maximum metabolic rates (MMRs) is related to several ecological and morphological variables. Mass- and temperature-adjusted RMR and MMR are highly correlated along a continuum spanning a 30- to 40-fold range. Phylogenetic generalized least squares models suggest that RMR and MMR are higher in pelagic species and that species with higher trophic levels exhibit elevated MMR. This variation is mirrored at various levels of structural organization: gill surface area, muscle protein content, and caudal fin aspect ratio (a proxy for activity) are positively related with aerobic capacity. Muscle protein content and caudal fin aspect ratio are also positively correlated with RMR. Hypoxia-tolerant lineages fall at the lower end of the metabolic continuum. Different ecological lifestyles are associated with contrasting levels of aerobic capacity, possibly reflecting the interplay between selection for increased locomotor performance on one hand and tolerance to low resource availability, particularly oxygen, on the other. These results support the aerobic capacity model of the evolution of endothermy, suggesting elevated body temperatures evolved as correlated responses to selection for high activity levels."
0,"Aromatic-aromatic interactions are a prominent feature of the crystal structure of ELIC [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 2VL0], a bacterial member of the nicotinic receptor superfamily of ion channels where five pore-facing phenylalanines come together to form a structure akin to a narrow iris that occludes the transmembrane pore. To identify the functional state of the channel that this structure represents, we engineered phenylalanines at various pore-facing positions of the muscle acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (one position at a time), including the position that aligns with the native phenylalanine 246 of ELIC, and assessed the consequences of such mutations using electrophysiological and toxin-binding assays. From our experiments, we conclude that the interaction among the side chains of pore-facing phenylalanines, rather than the accumulation of their independent effects, leads to the formation of a nonconductive conformation that is unresponsive to the application of ACh and is highly stable even in the absence of ligand. Moreover, electrophysiological recordings from a GLIC channel (another bacterial member of the superfamily) engineered to have a ring of phenylalanines at the corresponding pore-facing position suggest that this novel refractory state is distinct from the well-known desensitized state. It seems reasonable to propose then that it is in this peculiar nonconductive conformation that the ELIC channel was crystallized. It seems also reasonable to propose that, in the absence of rings of pore-facing aromatic side chains, such stable conformation may never be attained by the ACh receptor. Incidentally, we also noticed that the response of the proton-gated wild-type GLIC channel to a fast change in pH from pH 7.4 to pH 4.5 (on the extracellular side) is only transient, with the evoked current fading completely in a matter of  seconds. This raises the possibility that the crystal structures of GLIC obtained at pH 4.0 (PDB code 3EHZ) and pH 4.6 (PDB code 3EAM) correspond to the to the (well-known) desensitized state."
0,"Soy protein concentrate (SPC), as a protein source, is widely used to replace partial fishmeal (FM) in aquafeeds, especially for carnivorous fish. This study investigated the effects of partial FM replacement by SPC for juvenile pearl gentian grouper. The fish were fed with diets containing six levels of SPC (SPC 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75) for 6 weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, average body weight gain (BWG), specific growth ratio (SGR), and weight gain ratio (WGR) had the highest values in fish fed with diet SPC 15, followed by that of fish fed with SPC 0 while fish fed with SPC 75 had the lowest values (P < 0.05). Fish fed with diet SPC 15 and SPC 30 had the highest protein efficiency ratio (PER) while fish fed with diet SPC 15, SPC 30, and SPC 45 had the highest feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P < 0.05). Daily feed intake (DFI) was significantly decreased in fish fed with diets containing any level of SPC (P < 0.05). Survival rate was significantly higher in fish fed with diets SPC 15, SPC 30, and SPC 45 as compared to other treatments. Fish fed the diet including less than 30% FM replacement showed a higher protein content in the muscle. The ADC of dietary protein and some amino acids were significantly higher in diets SPC 0, followed by SPC 15; while SPC 75 had the lowest content (P < 0.05). Similarly, fish fed with SPC 30 and SPC 15 showed significantly higher protein and amino acid (AA) retention than other dietary treatments. The optimal FM replacement with SPC for specific growth ratio (SGR) was estimated to be 14.41% using a non-linear higher order regression model. These results indicated that pearl gentian grouper has a limited ability to utilize SPC as a protein source, and the FM replacement with SPC should be less than 30% (FM45.5 g 100g -1 and SPC18g 100g -1)."
0,"Myostatin is a TGF-beta family member that plays a key role in regulating skeletal muscle growth. Previous studies in mammals have demonstrated that myostatin is capable of binding the two activin type II receptors. Additionally, activin type II receptors have been shown to be capable of binding a number of other TGF-beta family members besides myostatin. An injection of a soluble form of activin type IIB receptor obtained from CHO cells into wild-type mice generated up to a 60% increase in muscle mass in 2 weeks. The knowledge on the role of activin receptors in fish is limited. In the present study, we examined the growth effect of administering a recombinant, soluble form of goldfish activin type IIB receptor extracellular domain to juvenile and larval goldfish (Carassius auratus), African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) larvae and tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) larvae. We have expressed the goldfish activin type IIB receptor extracellular domain in the yeast Pichia pastoris and we have demonstrated for the first time that this recombinant molecule stimulates growth in teleost fish in a dose-dependent manner. We provide evidence that this body weight increase is achieved by an increase in muscle mass and protein content. Histological analysis of the goldfish muscle revealed that treated fish exhibited hyperplasia as compared to controls. These findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate growth in non-mammalian vertebrates and suggest a powerful biotechnology approach to improving fish growth in aquaculture."
0,"The role of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) on regulation of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) as well as the possible involvement of IGF-1 receptor subtype a (IGF-1Ra) mRNA was assessed in juvenile specimens of Sparus aurata. IGF-1Ra was successfully cloned, and active receptor domains were localized in its mRNA precursor. Also, phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequence indicated a closer proximity to IGF-1Ra isoform found in zebrafish and other teleosts, than to the isoform IGF-1Rb. The most abundant presence of IGF-1Ra mRNA was detected in white muscle, whereas head kidney showed the lowest gene expression among 24 different studied tissues. Pituitaries of juvenile specimens of S. aurata were incubated in vitro with different doses of IGF-1 (0, 1, 100, and 1000 ng mL(-1)) during a period of 10 h. Total RNA with a high quality could be obtained from these pituitaries. PRL mRNA expression significantly increased with increasing IGF-1 doses. Similarly, IGF-1Ra mRNA increased its expression in response to IGF-1. However, GH mRNA levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner after IGF-1 treatment. The contradictory responses of GH and PRL expressions to IGF-1 in our experiment are possibly mediated by IGF-1Ra presence on the somatotrophs and prolactotrophs. The increase in IGF-1Ra mRNA levels may be related to the proper activation of the PI3-K/Akt signal transduction pathways which are normally involved in GH and PRL regulation."
0,"In this study, we evaluated the effects of prolonged exposure to two different nano-TiO2 crystal phases under different illumination conditions. Fish (Piaractus mesopotamicus) were exposed for 21 days to 100 mg/L of nano-TiO2 anatase and a mixture of anatase:rutile (80%:20%) under visible light and UV light (UVA and B, 22.47 J/cm2/h). The following oxidative stress biomarkers were mon- itored: concentrations of lipid hydroperoxide (LPO), carbonylated proteins (PCO), and specific activ- ities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Other biomarkers as well as specific activities of acid phosphatase (AP), Na+, K(+)-ATPase and metalloth- ionein levels (MT) were also evaluated. Moreover, micronucleus and comet assays were performed to assess genotoxicity. Our results showed low toxicity of nano-TiO2 to fish and lack of titanium accumulation in muscle tissue. However, it was observed the occurrence of sublethal effects that were influenced by nano-TiO2 crystal phase and illumination condition. Pure anatase caused more oxidative damage without co-exposure to UV, while the mixture anatase:rutile caused more sub- lethal effects when exposure occurred under UV. These findings show that the specific activity of CAT, GST, PCO levels and comet assay are useful as biomarkers of prolonged exposure to nano- TiO2. Overall, our study substantiates the development and implementation of nanoecotoxicological protocols."
0,"Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is an adapter protein involved in the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). In this study, a full length cDNA of MyD88 was cloned from turbot, Scophthalmus maximus. It is 1619 bp in length and contains an 858-bp open reading frame that encodes a peptide of 285 amino acid residues. The putative turbot (Sm)MyD88 protein possesses a N-terminal death domain and a C-terminal Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain known to be important for the functions of MyD88 in mammals. Phylogenetic analysis grouped SmMyD88 with other fish MyD88s. SmMyD88 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues of healthy turbots, with higher levels observed in immune-relevant organs. To explore the role of SmMyD88, its gene expression profile in response to stimulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) or turbot reddish body iridovirus (TRBIV) was studied in the head kidney, spleen, gills and muscle over a 7-day time course. The results showed an up-regulation of SmMyD88 transcript levels by the three immunostimulants in all four examined tissues, with the induction by CpG-ODN strongest and initiated earliest and inducibility in the muscle very weak. Additionally, TRBIV challenge resulted in a quite high level of SmMyD88 expression in the spleen, whereas the two synthetic immunostimulants induced the higher levels in the head kidney. These data provide insights into the roles of SmMyD88 in the TLR/IL-1R signaling pathway of the innate immune system in turbot. "
0,"Interactions between fish myoglobin (Mb) and myofibrillar proteins were investigated in a Mb-natural actomyosin (NAM) model at 4 degrees C. Increases in metmyoglobin (MetMb) formation and the relative content of bound Mb were observed, as were decreases in whiteness and Ca(2+)-ATPase activity (P < 0.05). During the first 6 h of incubation, Mb bound preferably to myosin at domains other than the head portion, as evidenced by measurable ATPase activity. The potential binding of Mb to myosin heads occurred after 24-h incubation as evidenced by the marked decrease in Ca(2+)-ATPase activity of the NAM-Mb mixture when compared to that of NAM alone (P < 0.05). The interaction between fish Mb and myofibrillar proteins was more pronounced with increased storage time; formation of high-molecular-weight aggregates (> 206 kDa) also increased with time. Electrophoretic study revealed that disulfide bonds were not involved in Mb-NAM interactions."
0,"The isolated cathepsin D-like enzyme from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) liver was shown to be a monomer with a molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa. It was inhibited by Pepstatin A and had an optimum for degradation of haemoglobin at pH 3.0. The purified enzyme had lower temperature stability than bovine cathepsin D. Antibodies raised against the purified enzyme and against two C-terminal peptides of cod cathepsin D recognized a 40 kDa protein in immunoblotting of the samples from the purification process. Both antisera showed cross reactivity with a similar sized protein in liver from cod, saithe (Pollachius virens L.), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus L.) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). A protein of same size was detected in wolffish (Anarhichas lupus L.) liver with the antibody directed against the purified enzyme. This antibody also recognized the native enzyme and detected the presence of cathepsin D in muscle of cod, saithe, herring and salmon. These antibodies may be useful in understanding the mechanisms of post mortem muscle degradation in fish by comparing immunohistochemical localization and enzyme activity, in particular in cod with different rate of muscle degradation. They may also be used for comparing muscle degradation in different fish species."
0,"To investigate the effect of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on the circadian rhythm pathway, we cloned clock and circadian rhythmic pathway-associated genes (e.g. Per2, Cry1, Cry2, and BMAL1) in the self-fertilizing mangrove killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus. The promoter region of Km-clock had 1 aryl hydrocarbon receptor element (AhRE, GTGCGTGACA) and 8 estrogen receptor (ER) half-sites, indicating that the AhRE and ER half sites would likely be associated with regulation of clock protein activity during EDCs-induced cellular stress. The Km-clock protein domains (bHLH, PAS1, PAS2) were highly conserved in five additional fish species (zebrafish, Japanese medaka, Southern platyfish, Nile tilapia, and spotted green pufferfish), suggesting that the fish clock protein may play an important role in controlling endogenous circadian rhythms. The promoter regions of Km-BMAL1, -Cry1, -Cry2, and -Per2 were found to contain several xenobiotic response elements (XREs), indicating that EDCs may be able to alter the expression of these genes. To analyze the endogenous circadian rhythm in K. marmoratus, we measured expression of Km-clock and other circadian rhythmic genes (e.g. Per2, Cry1, Cry2, and BMAL1) in different tissues, and found ubiquitous expression, although there were different patterns of transcript amplification during different developmental stages. In an estrogen (E2)-exposed group, Km-clock expression was down-regulated, however, a hydroxytamoxifen (TMX, nonsteroid estrogen antagonist)-exposed group showed an upregulated pattern of Km-clock expression, suggesting that the expression of Km-clock is closely associated with exposure to EDCs. In response to the exposure of bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-tert-octyphenol (OP), Km-clock expression was down-regulated in the pituitary/brain, muscle, and skin in both gender types (hermaphrodite and secondary male). In juvenile K. marmoratus liver tissue, expression of Km-clock and other circadian rhythmic pathway-associated genes showed a regular oscillation pattern over a period of approximately 24h during a 12L:12D cycle. However, the circadian rhythm of BPA-exposed juvenile K. marmoratus liver tissue was perturbed over a 12L:12D period. This study will aid in our understanding of how EDCs perturb endogenous circadian rhythms, particularly in BPA-exposed fish liver tissue. "
0,"Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are one of the most widely used nanomaterials in various fields. Especially, the unique chemical and physical properties make them as the promising candidates in drug target identification, unfortunately, little is known about their application in parasites. In this paper, GNPs were employed as new solid support to identify drug targets of natural bioactive compound arctigenin (ARG) against fish monogenean parasite Gyrodactylus kobayashi. Before target identification, GNPs with ARG on the surface showed the ability to enter the live parasites even the nucleus or mitochondria, which made the bound compounds capable of contacting directly with target proteins located anywhere of the parasites. At the same time, chemically modified compound remained the anthelminthic efficacy against G. kobayashii. The above results both provide assurance on the reliability of using GNPs for drug target-binding specificity. Subsequently, by interrogating the cellular proteome in parasite lysate, myosin-2 and UNC-89 were identified as the potential direct target proteins of ARG in G. kobayashii. Moreover, results of RNA-seq transcriptomics and iTRAQ proteomics indicated that myosin-2 expressions were down-regulated after ARG bath treatment both in transcript and protein levels, but for UNC-89, only in mRNA level. Myosin-2 is an important structural muscle protein expressed in helminth tegument and its identification as our target will enable further inhibitor optimization towards future drug discovery. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the power of GNPs to be readily applied to other parasite drugs of unknown targets, facilitating more broadly therapeutic drug design in any pathogen or disease model."
0,"Dendritic cells (DCs) have a strong ability to stimulate naive T lymphocyte proliferation, so DCs play an important regulatory role in the initiation of the specific immune response. DCs cannot play the role of antigen presentation without the expression of surface molecules. The chemokine receptor CCR7 and the costimulatory molecules CD80/86 and CD83 are not only markers of DC maturation but also important functional molecules in the immune response of DC-T cells. In this study, partial cDNA sequences of CCR7, CD80/86 and CD83 were obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technology from yellow catfish. Bioinformatics analysis of deduced amino acid sequences of these three genes showed that CCR7, CD80/86 and CD83 genes in yellow catfish have similar functional domains to the homologs in other vertebrates, which indicated that the functions of these genes may be somewhat conserved during the evolution process. Afterward, the expression characteristics of these three genes in different tissues were detected by q-PCR. This result indicated that CCR7, CD80/86 and CD83 were expressed in all examined tissues, and the highest expression levels of CCR7 and CD80/86 and CD83 were detected in the trunk kidney, muscle and midgut, respectively. Meanwhile, the expression levels of CCR7 and CD80/86 were lowest in the gill, and the expression of CD83 was lowest in the stomach. Finally, healthy yellow catfish were infected with A.hydrophila (1.0 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mL) or E.ictaluri (1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL), q-PCR results indicated that both pathogenic bacteria can induce significant upregulation of CCR7, CD80/86 and CD83 in immune organs, and the expression levels of these genes in the intestine were higher than those in the skin and gill. Our results in this study provide a molecular basis for exploring the role of CCR7, CD80/86 and CD83 in the immune responses induced by bacteria, and can help us to understand the difference of immune responses induced by extracellular and intracellular bacteria."
0,"Most studies on dietary vegetable oil in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have been conducted on a background of dietary EPA (20 : 5n-3) and DHA (22 : 6n-3) contained in the fishmeal used as a protein source in aquaculture feed. If dietary EPA and DHA repress their endogenous synthesis from α-linolenic acid (ALA, 18 : 3n-3), then the potential of ALA-containing vegetable oils to maintain tissue EPA and DHA has been underestimated. We examined the effect of individual dietary n-3 PUFA on the expression of the biosynthetic genes required for metabolism of ALA to DHA in rainbow trout. A total of 720 juvenile rainbow trout were allocated to twenty-four experimental tanks and assigned one of eight diets. The effect of dietary ALA, EPA or DHA, in isolation or in combination, on hepatic expression of fatty acyl desaturase (FADS)2a(Δ6), FADS2b(Δ5), elongation of very long-chain fatty acid (ELOVL)5 and ELOVL2 was examined after 3 weeks of dietary intervention. The effect of these diets on liver and muscle phospholipid PUFA composition was also examined. The expression levels of FADS2a(Δ6), ELOVL5 and ELOVL2 were highest when diets were high in ALA, with no added EPA or DHA. Under these conditions ALA was readily converted to tissue DHA. Dietary DHA had the largest and most consistent effect in down-regulating the gene expression of all four genes. The ELOVL5 expression was the least responsive of the four genes to dietary n-3 PUFA changes. These findings should be considered when optimising aquaculture feeds containing vegetable oils and/or fish oil or fishmeal to achieve maximum DHA synthesis. "
0,"Pax3 and Pax7 are the regulators and markers of muscle progenitors and satellite cells that contribute to the embryonic development and postembryonic growth of skeletal muscle in vertebrates, as well as to its repair and regeneration. However, information regarding them in vertebrate genome model, torafugu Takifugu rubripes, has remained unknown. Therefore, as an initial step, here we characterized Pax3 and Pax7 from torafugu and investigated their expression patterns during different developmental stages by RT-PCR. In silico analysis with the Fugu genome database (ver. 4.0) yielded two distinct genes each for Pax3 (Pax3a and Pax3b) and Pax7 (Pax7a and Pax7b). The 75th amino acid, glutamine (Gln75), from the N-terminus was replaced by proline in the paired box domain (PD) of Pax3a. One single cDNA clone encoding Pax3a had deletion of Gln75 in PD, suggesting the presence of alternatively spliced variants (Q+/Q-). This was further supported by identification of two adjacent alternative 3' splice acceptor sites which produce Pax3b Q+ (aagCAGGGA) and Q- (aagcagGGA) variants. Interestingly, torafugu Pax7a, but not Pax7b, had an insert encoding five amino acid residues (SGEAS) in a C-terminal region of PD in two out of three cDNA clones. Genomic analysis showed two alternate splice donor sites at exon 4 of Pax7a. In synteny analysis, torafugu Pax3a showed syntenic relationship with the corresponding regions in other teleosts only, whereas Pax3b and Pax7b showed high syntenic relationship with the corresponding regions of both mammals and other teleosts. RT-PCR revealed that expression of Pax3a and Pax3b transcripts was restricted to embryonic stages only, whereas those of Pax7a and Pax7b was continued to be expressed in larvae and importantly those of Pax7a were found in adult skeletal muscles. Therefore, Pax3 appears to be most important for primary myogenesis and Pax7 for secondary myogenesis and growth by hyperplasia in fish. In this regard, the transcripts of torafugu Pax3 and Pax7 genes might be used for further investigation as a marker for identification of muscle precursor cells during different phases of growth, and this ambiguity is the next target of our research.

0,"It is widely believed that enzymatic activities in ectothermic organisms adapt to environmental temperatures. However, to date, no study has thoroughly compared multiple thermodynamic enzymatic characteristics across species living in dramatically different environments. To start to address this gap, we compared the characteristics of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) purified from the muscles from slime flounder Microstomus achne white muscle and bovine skeletal muscle (bM<sub>4</sub>) and heart. The K <sub>m</sub> and V <sub>max</sub> for pyruvate reduction were about three times higher for M. achne LDH than bM<sub>4</sub> Surprisingly, maximum LDH activity was observed at ∼30 °C and ∼50 °C for M. achne and bovine LDHs, respectively, suggesting that the maximum enzymatic activity of LDH is set at a temperature ∼20 °C higher than environmental or body temperature across species. Although K <sub>m</sub> and V <sub>max</sub> values of these LDHs increased with temperature, the V <sub>max</sub>/K <sub>m</sub> ratio for M. achne LDH and bM<sub>4</sub> was independent. Differential scanning calorimetry and enthalpy change measurements confirmed that M. achne and bovine muscle-specific LDHs shared similar properties. Based on the present findings and previous reports, we hypothesize that the function and thermodynamic properties of muscle LDH are highly conserved between a teleost adapted to cold, M. achne, and bovine."
0,"The function of the transcriptional enhancer, Emu3', of the IgH locus of the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, involves the interaction of E-protein and Oct family transcription factors. The E-proteins [class I basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family] are encoded in mammals by three genes: E2A (of which E12/E47 are alternatively spliced products), HEB, and E2-2. An E2A homologue has been identified in a catfish B-cell cDNA library and contains regions homologous to the bHLH and activation domains of mammalian and other vertebrate E2A proteins. E2A message is widely expressed, being readily detected in catfish B cells, T cells, kidney, spleen, brain, and muscle. Its expression is lower than that previously observed for TF12/CFEB, the catfish homologue of HEB. E2A strongly activated transcription of a muE5 motif-dependent construct in catfish B cells, and also activated transcription from the core region of the catfish IgH enhancer (Emu3') in a manner dependent on the presence of the muE5 site. Catfish E2A, expressed in vitro, bound the muE5 motif present in the core region of Emu3'. These results document the conservation of structure and function in vertebrate E2A and suggest a potential role of E2A in driving expression of the IgH locus at the phylogenetic level of a teleost fish."
0,"C-Reactive protein (CRP) plays an important role in the acute phase response. Transcripts encoding two new CRP-like molecules (ccCRP1 and ccCRP2) from European common carp have been characterized which has enabled seven CRP-like genes to be identified in zebrafish. 79.3% (ccCRP1) and 74.5% (ccCRP2) identity to CRP from East-Asian common carp occurs and fish CRP genes form a distinct clade. ccCRP2 gene organization comprises four exons and three introns, in contrast to the two exons/one intron organization of mammalian CRP genes. Gene expression assays showed both ccCRP-like molecules are constitutively expressed in liver, skin, gill, gut, muscle, kidney, spleen and blood. Protein levels of ccCRP in serum and spleen were significantly different from other organs analyzed, and levels were greatest in the liver. It is proposed that the two carp CRP genes defined differ in their expression profiles which may suggest differences in their biological activities."
0,"The highly conserved protein prohibitin 2 (PHB2) has been implicated as a cell-surface receptor in the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, transcription, and mitochondrial protein folding. In the present study, we identified a Lampetra morii homologue of PHB2, Lm-PHB2, showing greater than 61.8% sequence identity with its homologues. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the position of Lm-PHB2 is consistent with lamprey phylogeny. Expression of the Lm-PHB2 protein was nearly equivalent in the heart, liver, kidneys, intestines, and muscles of normal lampreys. However, the Lm-PHB2 protein was down-regulated in the myocardia of lampreys challenged for 5 days with adriamycin (Adr), followed by a significant up-regulation 10 days after treatment. In vitro, recombinant Lm-PHB2 (rLm-PHB2) protein could significantly enhance the H2O2-induced oxidative stress tolerance in Chang liver (CHL) cells. Further mechanism studies indicated that the nucleus-to-mitochondria translocation of Lm-PHB2 was closely involved in the oxidative stress protection. Our results suggests that the strategies to modulate Lm-PHB2 levels may constitute a novel therapeutic approach for myocardial injury and liver inflammatory diseases, conditions in which oxidative stress plays a critical role in tissue injury and inflammation. "
0,"The relationship between fish health and muscle growth is critical for continued expansion of the aquaculture industry. The effect of immune stimulation on the expression of genes related to the energy balance of fish is poorly understood. In mammals immune stimulation results in major transcriptional changes in muscle, potentially to allow a reallocation of amino acids for use in the immune response and energy homeostasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of immune stimulation on fish muscle gene expression."
1,"Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) primary muscle cell cultures were stimulated with recombinant (r)IL-1β, a major proinflammatory cytokine, for 24 h in order to simulate an acute immune response. The transcriptomic response was determined by RNA hybridization to a 4 × 44 K Agilent Atlantic salmon microarray platform. The rIL-1β stimulation induced the expression of genes related to both the innate and adaptive immune systems. In addition there were highly significant changes in the expression of genes related to regulation of the cell cycle, growth/structural proteins, proteolysis and lipid metabolism. Of interest were a number of IGF binding proteins that were differentially expressed, which may demonstrate cross talk between the growth and immune systems."
2,"We show rIL-1β modulates the expression of not only immune related genes, but also that of genes involved in processes related to growth and metabolism. Co-stimulation of muscle cells with both rIGF-I and rIL-1β demonstrates cross talk between these pathways providing potential avenues for further research. This study highlights the potential negative effects of inflammation on muscle protein deposition and growth in fish and extends our understanding of energy allocation in ectothermic animals."
0,"Swimming behavior in fish is driven by coordinated contractions of muscle fibers. In zebrafish, slow muscle cell migration is crucial for the formation of the muscle network; slow myoblasts, which arise from medial adaxial cells, migrate radially to the lateral surface of the trunk and tail during embryogenesis. This study found that the zebrafish A-kinase anchoring protein (akap)12 isoforms akap12α and akap12β are required for muscle morphogenesis and locomotor activity. Embryos deficient in akap12 exhibited reduced spontaneous coiling, touch response, and free swimming. Akap12-depleted slow but not fast muscle cells were misaligned, suggesting that the behavioral abnormalities resulted from specific defects in slow muscle patterning; indeed, slow muscle cells and muscle pioneers in these embryos showed abnormal migration in a cell-autonomous manner. Taken together, these results suggest that akap12 plays a critical role in the development of zebrafish locomotion by regulating the normal morphogenesis of muscles. "
0,"ATP released from immune cells plays an important role in activation of host innate immunity. However, the molecular mechanisms for pathogen infection-induced ATP release in fish remains unclear. Pannexin1 (Panx1) is a recently identified ATP release channel important for controlling immune responses. The immune relevance of Panx1 in fish, however, is still poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a Panx1 gene homologue (termed tPanx1) from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and analyzed its expression in response to different immune challenges. We also investigated the role of tPanx1 channel in bacterial infection-induced ATP release. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that tPanx1 gene is expressed in all tested tissues with predominant expression in intestine. Immune challenges with lipopolysaccharide, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid and zymosan led to increased gene expression of tPanx1 in tilapia head kidney cells and peripheral blood leucocytes. In addition, tPanx1 gene was up-regulated in hepatopancreas, muscle, spleen, gill, head kidney and blood after Aeromonas hydrophila infection. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of tPanx1 channel activity with Panx1 channel inhibitor, carbenoxolone, significantly attenuated A. hydrophila infection-induced ATP release in tilapia head kidney cells. Taken together, our findings suggested that tPanx1 is an important immune response gene involved in bacterial infection-induced ATP release in tilapia O. niloticus."
0,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether feeding cats reduced protein and phosphorus foods with added fish oil, L-carnitine, and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) altered serum biomarkers of renal function. Thirty-two healthy cats, mean age 14.0 (8.3-19.6) years, were fed control food or one of two experimental foods for 6 months. All foods had similar concentrations of moisture, protein, and fat (approximately 8.0%, 26.5%, and 20.0%, respectively). Both experimental foods contained added fish oil (1.5%) and L-carnitine (500 mg/kg). Experimental-food 2 also contained increased MCT (10.5% from coconut oil), 1.5% added corn oil, and reduced animal fat. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum biochemistries, renal function biomarkers including serum creatinine (sCr) and symmetrical dimethylarginine (SDMA), and plasma metabolomic profiles were measured at baseline, and at 1.5, 3, and 6 months. Body composition was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Although both experimental foods altered plasma fatty acids, carnitine and related metabolites, and lysophospholipid concentrations, there were no changes in renal function biomarkers. There was, however, a benefit in using SDMA versus sCr to assess renal function in older cats with less total lean mass. Compared with cats <12 years, those >15 years had lower total lean mass (P < 0.01), lower GFR (P = 0.04), and lower sCr concentrations (P < 0.01). However, SDMA concentrations (P < 0.01) were higher in older cats. This study shows that in cats, serum SDMA concentration is more highly correlated with GFR than sCr concentration, and, unlike sCr, which declines with age because of muscle wasting, SDMA increases as GFR declines with age."
0,"In order to investigate the influence of non-thermal effects of microwaves on the flavour of fish and meat products, the G-actin of grass carp in ice baths was exposed to different microwave powers (0, 100, 300 or 500 W); the surface hydrophobicity, sulfhydryl contents, secondary structures and adsorption capacity of G-actin to ketones were determined."
1,"As microwave power increased from 0 to 300 W, the surface hydrophobicity, total and reactive sulfhydryls increased; α-helix, β-sheet and random coil fractions turned into β-turn fractions. As microwave power increased from 300 to 500 W, however, hydrophobicity and sulfhydryl contents decreased; β-turn and random coil fractions turned into α-helix and β-sheet fractions. The tendencies of adsorbed capacity of ketones were similar to hydrophobicity and sulfhydryl contents."
2,"The increased adsorbing of ketones could be attributed to the unfolding of secondary structures by revealing new binding sites, including thiol groups and hydrophobic binding sites. The decreased binding capacity was related to the refolding and aggregation of protein. The results suggested that microwave powers had obvious effects on the flavour retention and proteins structures in muscle foods. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry."
0,"Muscle development in teleost embryos has been shown to depend on myogenic cell recruitment from the dermomyotome (DM). However, little is known as to the cellular mechanisms that account for myotome growth after the dissociation of the DM. Here we combine immunolabeling for cell-specific markers with quantitative analysis to determine the sources and patterns of activation of myogenic cells in pearlfish larvae. Results demonstrate that appearance of mitotically active myogenic precursors inside the myotome coincides with the dissociation of the DM. Such cells are preferentially aggregated within the posterior lateral fast muscle. We therefore propose a growth model in which a pool of proliferative DM-derived precursors transferred to the posterior lateral fast muscle functions as an important source of myogenic cell spread to carry forward stratified fast muscle hyperplasia. This indicates that postembryonic teleost muscle growth includes a cellular mechanism that has no direct equivalent in the amniotes."
0,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of innate immune receptors that recognize molecular patterns associated with microbial pathogens (PAMP) and induce antimicrobial immune responses. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a TLR1 homologue from the large yellow croaker (LycTLR1). The complete cDNA of LycTLR1 is 3487 nucleotides long, encoding a protein of 802 amino acids. The deduced LycTLR1 has a typical TLR domain architecture including 4 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (residues 42-491), one C-terminal LRR domain (residues 527-583) at the extracellular region and a TIR domain (residues 646-791) in the cytoplasmic region. Homology comparison shows that LycTLR1 has 76.8%-47.6% amino acid identity to known fish TLR1. Genomic analysis revealed that LycTLR1 consisted of only one exon in the coding region, which is conserved among other TLR1 from different mammalian species and fish analyzed to date, except the zebrafish. The mRNA of LycTLR1 was constitutively expressed in spleen, head kidney, blood, liver, heart, gills, intestine, brains and muscle, with the highest levels in spleen and blood. Upon stimulation with LPS, the LycTLR1 expression obviously increased in the anterior kidney cells of large yellow croaker, suggesting a role for LycTLR1 in the immune response to LPS. "
0,"Although some commercial vaccines against grass carp reovirus (GCRV) are available, given the many varieties of GCRV and limited types of vaccines, the disease caused by GCRV remains a major problem, which leads to economic losses in grass carp aquaculture. A reovirus strain (GCRV-HN14) was recently isolated from local diseased fish in our laboratory. The S11 segment of GCRV-HN14 was speculated to encode the virus capsid protein VP35. In our study, the S11 segment was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) to construct the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-s11, which was then transfected into CIK cells, and the VP35 protein was successfully expressed. Grass carp was immunized with pcDNA3.1-s11, and the in vivo distribution and expression of the pcDNA3.1-s11 plasmids were analyzed by PCR and Western blot. Recombinant plasmids were detected in the blood, liver, spleen, kidney, and muscle. However, protein expression could only be detected in the muscle. The immune protection of the pcDNA3.1-s11 plasmid in grass carp was evaluated using a series of experiments. Results showed that the population of white blood cells significantly increased at 1, 7, and 14 days post-immunization (dpi) and reached a peak with (9.58 ± 0.72) × 10<sup>7</sup>/ml at 7 dpi (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). The percentage of neutrophils reached a peak with (24.13 ± 2.38)% at 7 dpi (P < 0.01), whereas the lymphocytes peaked with (93.30 ± 4.71)% at 14 dpi (P < 0.05). Serum antibody levels were significantly enhanced in immunized fish at 14, 21, and 28 dpi (P < 0.01). The mRNA expression levels of type I interferon, immunoglobulin M, Toll-like receptor 22, and major histocompatibility complex class I were significantly up-regulated in the head kidney and spleen of immunized fish (P < 0.05). Grass carp immunized with pcDNA3.1-s11 exhibited a higher survival percentage (70.4%-73.3%) than the controls (5%-13%). Overall, as a DNA vaccine, the pcDNA3.1-s11 plasmid could induce immune protection against GCRV."
0,"The present study explored the impact of dietary isoleucine (Ile) on fish growth and flesh quality and revealed a possible role of muscle antioxidant defense in flesh quality in relation to dietary Ile. Grass carp (weighing 256.8±3.5 g) were fed diets containing six graded levels of Ile (3.8, 6.6, 9.3, 12.5, 15.2 and 18.5 g/kg) for eight weeks. The results indicated that compared with Ile deficiency (3.8 g/kg diets) and excess (18.5 g/kg diets) groups, 9.3-15.2 g Ile/kg diet supplementations promoted fish growth and muscle fat deposition, whereas 6.6-15.2 g Ile/kg diets supplementation enhanced muscle nutrients (protein and total EAAs) deposition. Furthermore, muscle shear force, pH value, and hydroxyproline concentration were improved by 9.3-12.5, 9.3 and 9.3 g Ile/kg diet supplementations, respectively. However, muscle cooking loss, lactate content, and activities of cathepsin B and L were decreased by 6.6-15.2, 9.3-12.5, 9.3-12.5 and 9.3-15.2 g Ile/kg diet supplementations, respectively. Additionally, 6.6-15.2 and 6.6-12.5 g Ile/kg diet supplementations attenuated malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents, respectively. The activities of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione content were enhanced by 6.6-9.3, 6.6-12.5 and 6.6-15.2 g Ile/kg diet supplementations, respectively. Moreover, the relative mRNA expressions of antioxidant enzymes, including Cu/Zn-SOD (6.6-12.5 g/kg diets) and GPx (12.5 g/kg diets), as well as antioxidant-related signaling molecules, including NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (6.6-12.5 g/kg diets), target of rapamycin (6.6-12.5 g/kg diets), ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (9.3-12.5 g/kg diets) and casein kinase 2 (6.6-12.5 g/kg diets), were up-regulated when Ile diet supplementations were administered at these levels, respectively, whereas the relative mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 was down-regulated with 9.3 g Ile/kg diet supplementations. Collectively, the present study indicated that optimum isoleucine improved flesh quality, partly due to the activation of antioxidant defense through the Nrf2 signaling pathway. "
0,"The dietary lysine requirement of sub-adult grass carp (460 ± 1.5 g) was assessed by feeding diets supplemented with grade levels of lysine (6.6, 8.5, 10.8, 12.9, 15.0 and 16.7 g kg(-1) diet) for 56 days. The test diets (28% CP) contained fish meal, casein and gelatin as sources of intact protein, supplemented with crystalline amino acids. Weight gain (WG), feed intake and feed efficiency were significantly improved with increasing levels of lysine up to 12.9 g kg(-1) diet and thereafter declined (P < 0.05). Quadratic regression analysis of WG at 95% maximum response indicated lysine requirement was 10.9 g kg(-1) diet. Activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase and alkaline phosphatase in intestine, creatine kinase activity in proximal and mid-intestine responded similar to WG (P < 0.05). In addition, lipid and protein oxidation decreased with increasing levels of lysine up to certain values and increased thereafter (P < 0.05); the anti-hydroxyl radical capacity, dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities and glutathione content were increased with increasing dietary lysine levels up to certain values in the detected tissues, except for hepatopancreatic GST. Requirement estimated on the basis of malondialdehyde content in intestine and hepatopancreas was 10.6 and 9.53 g lysine kg(-1) diet, respectively."
0,"Several researches reported that piscidin members of teleosts owned strong antiparasitic activity. Cryptocaryon irritans, a type of ectoparasite, could infect most of the marine teleosts. Larimichthys crocea could severely suffer from marine white spot disease caused by C. irritans, and their mortality rate was significantly high. Concentrating on this problem, we have done many related works. Piscidin 5 like (termed Lc-P5L) was another piscidin member isolated from a comparative transcriptome of C. irritans-immuned L. crocea. In the paper, quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed Lc-P5L was upregulated in examined tissues, including gill, head kidney, muscle, liver, spleen and intestine after challenged by C. irritans, the significant upregulation time was in accordance to key developmental stages of C. irritans, which implied different infection stages could result in host immune response. Furthermore, using microscope techniques, we observed theronts or trophonts became weakly motile, cilia became detached, cells were out of shape, membranes eventually lysed in different cell positions and cytoplasmic contents leaked. Laser confocal scanning microscope (LCSM) observed theronts macronucleus grew swell and depolymerized after treated by recombinant Lc-P5L (rLc-P5L). Data suggested rLc-P5L was significantly lethal to C. irritans, and the death state of the parasite incubated with rLc-P5L was remarkably similar to other piscidin members or other antiparasitic peptides (APPs). Thus, these data provided new insights into L. crocea immunity against C. irritans and potential of rLc-P5L as a therapeutic agent against pathogen invasion."
0,"The present study investigates the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of protein hydrolysates obtained from zebra blenny (Salaria basilisca) muscles treated with three different crude alkaline protease extracts in alloxan-induced diabetic rats (AIDR). Analysis of amino acid composition revealed that zebra blenny protein hydrolysates (ZBPHs) were valuable sources of essential amino acids and rich in leucine, which is one of the active ingredients for blood glucose control by inducing insulin release in both rats and humans. Treatment of AIDR with ZBPHs revealed a significant inhibition of α-amylase activity in serum and the intestine, as well as a reduction of blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in diabetic rats. Further, ZBPHs also decreased significantly the triglyceride (TG), total-cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) levels in the serum and liver of diabetic rats, while they increased the HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) level, which helped to maintain the homeostasis of blood lipids. Furthermore, ZBPHs exhibited potent protective effects against heart attack markers by reversing myocardial enzyme serum back to normal levels. ZBPHs may also exert significant protective effects on liver function, evidenced by a marked decrease in the level of serum bilirubin as well as in the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). These beneficial effects of ZBPHs were confirmed by histological findings in the hepatic and pancreatic tissues of diabetic rats. Indeed, they avoid lipid accumulation in the hepatocytes and protect the pancreatic β-cells from degeneration. Overall, the findings of the current study indicate that ZBPHs significantly attenuated hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in AIDR. "
0,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta promotes fatty acid catabolism and energy expenditure in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. A ligand for PPARdelta is required to activate PPARdelta function. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are potential ligands for PPARdelta activation. The current experiment was designed to determine the potential for PUFA, particularly from dietary fish oil, to activate porcine PPARdelta in vivo. Transgenic mice were generated to overexpress porcine PPARdelta in the adipose tissue. Mice were fed a high-saturated fat (13% beef tallow), or high-unsaturated fat (13% fish oil) diet, or a diet containing 4 mg/kg of a PPARdelta ligand (L165041) for 4 mo. Compared with beef tallow feeding, fish oil feeding reduced fat mass and decreased (P < 0.05) plasma triacylglycerol and FFA concentrations in the transgenic mice. Adipose tissue expression of genes involved in adipogenesis (i.e., lipoprotein lipase and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein) was decreased in transgenic mice fed fish oil or the PPARdelta ligand. In the same mice, expression of the lipolytic gene, hormone-sensitive lipase was increased (P < 0.05). Fish oil feeding also stimulated expression of genes participating in fatty acid oxidation in the liver of transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice. Overall, these results indicate that PUFA may serve as natural and effective regulators of lipid catabolism in vivo and many of these effects may be generated from activation of PPARdelta."
0,"One key bottleneck in understanding the human genome is the relative under-characterization of 90% of protein coding regions. We report a collection of 1200 transgenic zebrafish strains made with the gene-break transposon (GBT) protein trap to simultaneously report and reversibly knockdown the tagged genes. Protein trap-associated mRFP expression shows previously undocumented expression of 35% and 90% of cloned genes at 2 and 4 days post-fertilization, respectively. Further, investigated alleles regularly show 99% gene-specific mRNA knockdown. Homozygous GBT animals in <i>ryr1b</i>, <i>fras1</i>, <i>tnnt2a</i>, <i>edar</i> and <i>hmcn1</i> phenocopied established mutants. 204 cloned lines trapped diverse proteins, including 64 orthologs of human disease-associated genes with 40 as potential new disease models. Severely reduced skeletal muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in GBT <i>ryr1b</i> homozygous animals validated the ability to explore molecular mechanisms of genetic diseases. This GBT system facilitates novel functional genome annotation towards understanding cellular and molecular underpinnings of vertebrate biology and human disease."
0,"The thermal stability of the Antarctic Ocean raises questions concerning the metabolic plasticity of Antarctic notothenioids to changes in the environmental temperature. In this study, Notothenia rossii survived 90 days at 8 °C, and their condition factor level was maintained. However, their hepatosomatic (0.29×) index decreased, indicating a decrease in nutrient storage as a result of changes in the energy demands to support survival. At 8 °C, the plasma calcium, magnesium, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations decreased, whereas the glucose (1.91×) and albumin (1.26×) concentrations increased. The main energy substrate of the fish changed from lipids to glucose due to a marked increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity, as demonstrated by an increase in anaerobic metabolism. Moreover, malate dehydrogenase activity increased in all tissues, suggesting that fish acclimated at 8 °C exhibit enhanced gluconeogenesis. The aerobic demand increased only in the liver due to an increase (2.23×) in citrate synthase activity. Decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase to levels that are most likely sufficient at 8 °C were observed, establishing a new physiological activity range for antioxidant defense. Our findings indicate that N. rossii has some compensatory mechanisms that enabled its long-term survival at 8 °C."
0,"We studied the effects of starvation and re-feeding on the levels of plasma IGF-1, IGFBP-1 and expressions of hepatic IGF-1 mRNA and muscle IGF-1R mRNA in Carassius auratus gibelio. During the two week starvation period, both the levels of plasma IGF-1 and IGFBP-1 decreased and were significantly lower on day 14 (P <0.05). On the first day of re-feeding, the level of plasma IGF-1 increased sharply, to the level of control group, and had no significant changes for the remaining days. While the level of plasma IGFBP-1 was still greatly lower than that of control group at the first day of re-feeding, it increased significantly higher than that of control group by day 14 (P <0.05). During the starvation period, expression of IGF-1 mRNA in liver decreased, but it was not statistically different from that of the control group (P>0.05). During the early period of re-feeding, the abundance of IGF-1 mRNA was still significantly lower than that of control group (P <0.05), then increased to the level of control group on day 7. IGF-1R mRNA showed a decreasing trend after starvation, and reached a significantly low value on day 3 (P <0.05). After re-feeding, the abundance of IGF-1R mRNA increased to peak at day 14. These results indicate that the higher level of IGFBP-1 in serum and IGF-1R mRNA in muscle after re-feeding could improve the promoting growth effect of IGF-1 to participate in the regulation of compensatory growth."
0,"The viral hemorrhage disease caused by grass carp reovirus (GCRV) is a serious contagious disease of grass carp that mainly infects fingerlings and yearlings. Epidemiological studies have shown that GCRV genotype II is currently the prominent genotype. However, little is known about the histopathological characteristics, virus distribution, and expression of immunity-related genes in grass carp infected by GCRV genotype II. In this study, we found that grass carp infected by GCRV genotype II lost appetite, swam alone, and rolled, and their fins, eyes, operculum, oral cavity, abdomen, intestine, and muscles showed pronounced punctate hemorrhage. Congestion, swelling, deformation, thinning of membranes, dilatation and darkened color of nucleoli, cathepsis, erythrocyte infiltration, and vacuole formation were observed in some infected tissues. A qRT-PCR test showed that the 11 genome segments of GCRV had similar expression patterns in different tissues. The S8 segment, with unknown function and no homologous sequences, had the highest expression level, while the most conserved segment, L2, had the lowest expression level. GCRV particles were distributed in different tissues, especially in the intestine. In the infected intestine, the expression of various receptors and adaptor molecules was modulated at different levels. Pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression was 2160.9 times higher than that in the control group. The upregulation of immunity-related genes activated the antiviral immunity pathways. Therefore, the intestine might play a dual role in mediating GCRV infection and the antiviral immune response. This study provides detailed information about the pathogenicity of GCRV and expression of immunity-related genes, laying the foundation for further research on virus control and treatment."
0,"Glutathione peroxidases (GPXs; EC 1.11.19) are key enzymes in the antioxidant defence systems of living organisms, including fish. Here we report the cloning of two GPX cDNAs from southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii). One encodes a GPX1 or classical GPX and the other encodes a GPX4 or phospholipid hydroperoxide GPX. The 898 base-pair (bp) SBT GPX1 cDNA (GenBank accession no. EF452497) includes the complete protein coding region plus 35bp of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) and 296bp of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). The 974bp SBT GPX4 cDNA (GenBank accession no. EF452498) includes the complete protein coding region plus 101bp of the 5'-UTR and 306bp of the 3'-UTR. Both cDNAs contain a selenocysteine (Sec) codon in the protein coding region and a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element in the 3'-UTR. The SBT GPX4 cDNA may encode a mitochondrial targeting sequence. A deduced amino acid sequence comparison revealed that the SBT GPX1 sequence was 67% identical to a human GPX1 sequence (GenBank accession no. X13709) and 69-83% identical to other fish GPX1 sequences. Similarly, the SBT GPX4 sequence was 63% identical to a human GPX4 sequence (GenBank accession no. BC046163) and 72-93% identical to other fish GPX4 sequences. GPX1 and GPX4 gene expressions and total GPX enzyme activity were investigated in SBT liver, muscle, kidney, spleen, heart, stomach, gill and pyloric caeca. Expression of the two genes varied from one tissue to the next and roughly paralleled the inter-tissue variation in GPX enzyme activity. The results are discussed in relation to possible roles for GPX1 and GPX4 genes in antioxidant defense in SBT."
0,"The precise control of spatiotemporal expression of target genes is crucial when establishing transgenic animals, and the introduction of genes for fluorescent marker proteins is inevitable for accelerating research at molecular levels. To assist this, we constructed a novel dual promoter expression vector for two independent reporter genes, green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (mCherry). Their expression is designed under the control of two distinct tissue-specific promoters, e.g. zebrafish cardiac muscle-specific promoter (cmlc2) and medaka skeletal muscle-specific promoter (myl2) derived from the myosin light chain 2 genes, and they are placed in a head-to-head orientation. After microinjecting the dual promoter expression vector into fertilized eggs of medaka, the developing fish embryos and the resulting transgenic fish lines showed strong GFP signal in the whole body (skeletal muscle) and mCherry signal in the heart (cardiac muscle). However, weak GFP signal was observed in the heart, indicating a leakiness of the skeletal muscle promoter. To improve the stringency of dual promoter expression, we inserted two chicken-derived insulators, e.g. tandem copies of the core sequence (250 bp) of cHS4 (5'-hypersensitive site-4 chicken beta-globin insulator), in the boundary of two promoters. The dual promoter expression vector with insulator now ensured the stringent tissue-specific expression in the transgenic fish lines. Thus, our dual promoter expression system with insulator is compatible to the conventional IRES and fused reporter gene systems and will be an alternative method to produce the transgenic fishes."
0,"Metazoan akirin genes regulate innate immunity, myogenesis, and carcinogenesis. Invertebrates typically have one family member, while most tetrapod and teleost vertebrates have one to three. We demonstrate an expanded repertoire of eight family members in genomes of four salmonid fishes, owing to paralog preservation after three tetraploidization events. Retention of paralogs secondarily lost in other teleosts may be related to functional diversification and posttranslational regulation. We hypothesized that salmonid akirins would be transcriptionally regulated in fast-twitch skeletal muscle during activation of conserved pathways governing catabolism and growth. The in vivo nutritional state of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) was experimentally manipulated, and transcript levels for akirin family members and 26 other genes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), allowing the establishment of a similarity network of expression profiles. In fasted muscle, a class of akirins was upregulated, with one family member showing high coexpression with catabolic genes coding the NF-kappaB p65 subunit, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, E3 ubiquitin ligases, and IGF-I receptors. Another class of akirin was upregulated with subsequent feeding, coexpressed with 14-3-3 protein genes. There was no similarity between expression profiles of akirins with IGF hormones or binding protein genes. The level of phylogenetic relatedness of akirin family members was not a strong predictor of transcriptional responses to nutritional state, or differences in transcript abundance levels, indicating a complex pattern of regulatory evolution. The salmonid akirins epitomize the complexity linking the genome to physiological phenotypes of vertebrates with a history of tetraploidization."
0,"This study aimed to characterize the full-length cDNA of AMPKα2 in Megalobrama amblycephala, and evaluate its potential role in glucose homeostasis and carbohydrate metabolism. The cDNA obtained covered 1942bp with an open reading frame of 1635bp encoding 545 amino acids. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic analysis revealed a high homology (91-100%) among most fish and higher vertebrates. This AMPKα2 mRNA predominantly expressed in muscle, liver and brain, while little in gill and intestine. Then, the AMPKα2 expressions were determined in the muscle, liver and brain of fish subjected to a glucose load (injected intraperitoneally with 0, 1.67 and 3.34g glucose per kg body weight) and after a 12-week feeding trial (fed two dietary carbohydrate levels: 30% and 43%), respectively. After the glucose load, plasma glycemia peaked at 1h in fish. Thereafter, it decreased significantly to the basal level at 8h. However, AMPKα2 expression in muscle, liver and brain all decreased significantly during the first 2h, then returned to the basal value at 24h. Unlikely, tissue AMPKα2 expression of fish receiving saline solution increased significantly during the whole sampling period. Additionally, high-carbohydrate diet enhanced its expression in liver and muscle, but not that in brain. These findings indicated that the AMPKα2 gene shared a high degree of conservation with that of the other vertebrates. Muscle, liver and brain AMPKα2 expressions were highly induced by glucose administration. Furthermore, high dietary carbohydrate modified its expressions in these tissues."
0,"Fish allergy is associated with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions to parvalbumins, which are small calcium-binding muscle proteins and represent the major and sole allergens for 95% of fish-allergic patients. We performed Fourier transform infrared and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy to explore the pressure-temperature (p-T) phase diagram of cod parvalbumin (Gad m 1) and to elucidate possible new ways of pressure-temperature inactivation of this food allergen. Besides the secondary structure of the protein, the Ca(2+) binding to aspartic and glutamic acid residues was detected. The phase diagram was found to be quite complex, containing partially unfolded and molten globule states. The Ca(2+) ions were essential for the formation of the native structure. A molten globule conformation appears at 50 °C and atmospheric pressure, which converts into an unordered aggregated state at 75 °C. At >200 MPa, only heat unfolding, but no aggregation, was observed. A pressure of 500 MPa leads to a partially unfolded state at 27 °C. The complete pressure unfolding could only be reached at an elevated temperature (40 °C) and pressure (1.14 GPa). A strong correlation was found between Ca(2+) binding and the protein conformation. The partially unfolded state was reversibly refolded. The completely unfolded molecule, however, from which Ca(2+) was released, could not refold. The heat-unfolded protein was trapped either in the aggregated state or in the molten globule state without aggregation at elevated pressures. The heat-treated and the combined heat- and pressure-treated protein samples were tested with sera of allergic patients, but no change in allergenicity was found."
0,"Selenium (Se) deficiency and excess can lead to protein degradation in fish. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the main pathway of muscle proteolysis. This study aimed to investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of dietary Se on ubiquitin-mediated muscle protein degradation in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The fish were fed with the Se-deficient diet (0 mg/kg, DSe), Se-adequate diet (4 mg/kg, ASe), and Se-excessive diet (16 mg/kg, ESe), respectively. After a 10-week feeding trial, the growth performance, body composition, antioxidant enzyme activities, and UPS-related gene and protein expressions were detected. Results indicated that DSe and ESe diets significantly decreased the weight gain rate, specific growth rate, feed efficiency, and muscle crude protein content compared with ASe diet. The histological analysis showed that the mean diameter of muscle fibers was significantly decreased in DSe and ESe groups. And DSe and ESe diets significantly increased the contents of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide, but reduced the glutathione peroxidase activity. Additionally, the abundance of muscle ubiquitinated proteins and the expression levels of MuRF1 and Atrogin-1 were significantly increased in DSe and ESe groups. Compared to ASe diet, DSe and ESe diets significantly decreased the phosphorylation level of Akt Ser<sup>473</sup> and the ratio of p-FoxO3a/FoxO3a, but significantly increased the phosphorylation level of IκBα and upregulated the expressions of TNF-α, IL-8, and NF-κB. Overall, this study indicated that dietary Se deficiency and excess accelerated the ubiquitin-mediated muscle protein degradation through regulating Akt/FoxO3a and NF-κB signaling pathways in rainbow trout."
0,"Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is a pivotal economic fish that has been plagued by Streptococcus infections. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 5 (TRAF5) is a crucial adaptor molecule, which can trigger downstream signaling cascades involved in immune pathway. In this study, Nile tilapia TRAF5 coding sequence (named OnTRAF5) was obtained, which contained typical functional domains, such as RING, zinc finger, coiled-coil and MATH domain. Different from other TRAF molecules, OnTRAF5 had shown relatively low identify with its homolog, and it was clustered into other teleost TRAF5 proteins. qRT-PCR was used to analysis the expression level of OnTRAF5 in gill, skin, muscle, head kidney, heart, intestine, thymus, liver, spleen and brain, In healthy Nile tilapia, the expression level of OnTRAF5 in intestine, gill and spleen were significantly higher than other tissues. While under Streptococcus agalactiae infection, the expression level of OnTRAF5 was improved significantly in all detected organs. Additionally, over-expression WT OnTRAF5 activated NF-κB, deletion of RING or zinc finger caused the activity impaired. In conclusion, OnTRAF5 participate in anti-bacteria immune response and is crucial for the signaling transduction."
0,"One of the most fundamental biological processes in living organisms that are affected by environmental fluctuations is growth. In fish, skeletal muscle accounts for the largest proportion of body mass, and the growth of this tissue is mainly controlled by the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system. By using the carp (Cyprinus carpio), a fish that inhabits extreme conditions during winter and summer, we assessed the skeletal muscle plasticity induced by seasonal acclimatization and the relation of IGF signaling with protein synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis. The expression of igf1 in muscle decreased during winter in comparison with summer, whereas the expression for both paralogues of igf2 did not change significantly between seasons. The expression of igf1 receptor a (igf1ra), but not of igf1rb, was down-regulated in muscle during the winter as compared to the summer. A decrease in protein contents and protein phosphorylation for IGF signaling molecules in muscle was observed in winter-acclimatized carp. This was related with a decreased expression in muscle for markers of myogenesis (myoblast determination factor (myod), myogenic factor 5 (myf5), and myogenin (myog)); protein synthesis (myosin heavy chain (mhc) and myosin light chain (mlc3 and mlc1b)); and ribosomal biogenesis (pre-rRNA and ribosomal proteins). IGF signaling, and key markers of ribosomal biogenesis, protein synthesis, and myogenesis were affected by seasonal acclimatization, with differential regulation in gene expression and signaling pathway activation observed in muscle between both seasons. This suggests that these molecules are responsible for the muscle plasticity induced by seasonal acclimatization in carp. "
0,"The characteristic increase in protein catabolism during muscle atrophy is largely the result of an increase in E3 ubiquitin ligase expression, specifically that of atrogin-1, or FBXO32, which functions to polyubiquitinate proteins. In rainbow trout, the cDNA sequences of two E3 ubiquitin ligase F-box proteins, FBXO32 and FBXO25, were characterized and their expression across tissues in response to feed deprivation was determined. The cDNA sequence for FBXO32 encodes a protein 355 amino acids long and is 97% identical to the homologous protein in salmon, 85% to zebrafish and 72% identical to both human and mouse. The cDNA for FBXO25 encodes a protein 356 amino acids in length that is 98% identical to the homologous protein in salmon, 84% to zebrafish, and 75% to human. After 28days of feed deprivation, FBXO32 expression increased by approximately 13-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold in white muscle, red muscle, and intestine, respectively (P<0.05). Expression of FBXO32 and FBXO25 in kidney decreased 0.3-fold and 0.2-fold, respectively, and FBXO25 expression decreased by 0.2-fold in liver (P<0.05). These results indicate that these protein sequences are conserved and suggest that the up-regulation of FBXO32 is associated with skeletal and smooth muscle atrophy that occurs during fasting."
0,"In fish, T cell lineage commitment has not been studied, although there are reports related to CD4 and CD8 positive cells. This study describes the cloning and analysis of a master regulator involved in this process, the Th-POK gene in Japanese pufferfish, Takifugu rubripes. The Fugu Th-POK cDNA was composed of 1901 bp, with a 75 bp 5'-UTR, a 131 bp 3'-UTR, and a 1692 bp open reading frame which translates into a peptide of 564 amino acid residues. The deduced Fugu Th-POK protein contained a BTB/POZ domain, Krüppel motif (H/C linker) and Krüppel-like zinc finger DNA binding domain with C2H2 structure. The homology analysis of Fugu Th-POK (ZBTB7B) with other known ZBTB7 members (ZBTB7A, 7C) showed low identity, and the phylogenetic tree analysis showed the Fugu Th-POK clustered with the mammalian Th-POK, away from other ZBTB7 members. The analysis of transcriptional control region of Th-POK gene suggested that the 5'-flanking region and intron 1 include numerous canonical binding motifs for transcription factors regulating T cell development. The genomic organization of the Fugu Th-POK gene was composed of three exons and two introns, and its structure was identical to that of its human counterpart. Comparison of the Fugu and human genomes showed that high levels of conserved synteny existed around the Th-POK gene. The high expression of the Fugu Th-POK gene in unstimulated tissues was seen in head kidney, muscle, skin and gills. Moreover, the expression of the Fugu Th-POK gene in thymic cells was increased by LPS, polyI:C and PHA stimulation."
0,"Unique amongst the teleost, Plotosidae catfish possess a dendritic organ (DO) as a purported salt secreting organ, whereas other marine teleosts rely on their gill ionocytes for active NaCl excretion. To address the role of the DO in ionregulation, ligation experiments were conducted in brackish water (BW) 3‰ and seawater (SW) 34‰ acclimated Plotosus lineatus and compared to sham operated fish. Ligation in SW resulted in an osmoregulatory impairment in blood (elevated ions and hematocrit) and muscle (dehydration). However, SW ligation did not elicit compensatory changes in gill or kidney Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity and/or protein expression while a decrease in anterior intestine and increased in posterior intestine were observed but this was not reflected at the protein level. Following ligation in SW, protein levels of carbonic anhydrase (CA) and V-ATPase B subunit (VHAB) were higher in kidney but either lower (CA) or unchanged (VHAB) in other tissues. Taken together, the osmotic disturbance in ligated SW fish indicates the central role of the DO in salt secretion and the absence of a compensatory response from the gill."
0,"Frozen storage of fish is known to enhance lipid oxidation, resulting in the development of an unpleasant rancid taste and odor. Frozen storage of fish is also known to reduce protein solubility, and proteins are expected to be oxidatively modified; however, these oxidative mechanisms are poorly understood. Generally, protein oxidation leads to a wide range of modifications; the most studied being the formation of carbonyl groups. The present work shows, by UV spectrophometric determination of protein carbonyl groups in rainbow trout muscle, that storage at -20 degrees C resulted in a 2-fold increase in protein carbonylation compared to storage at -30 or -80 degrees C. Furthermore, low-salt-soluble proteins in fish that were either fresh or stored for 3 years at -80 degrees C were found to have similar extents of carbonylation. Proteome analysis and two-dimensional immunoblotting of rainbow trout low-salt- and high-salt-soluble proteins gave a detailed description of the protein carbonylation pattern. Several carbonylated proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS, such as nucleoside diphosphate kinase, adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase, actin, creatine kinase, tropomyosin, myosin light chains 1 and 2, and myosin heavy chain. Furthermore, the results showed a reduced solubility of nucleoside diphosphate kinase in fish stored at -20 degrees C for 2 years compared to fish stored at -80 degrees C. It was observed that low-abundant proteins could be relatively more carbonylated than high-abundant proteins, thereby indicating that some proteins are more susceptible to oxidation than others, due to either their cellular localization, amino acid sequence, or biochemical function."
0,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of threonine (Thr) on the digestive and absorptive ability, proliferation and differentiation of enterocytes, and gene expression of juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian). First, seven isonitrogenous diets containing graded levels of Thr (7.4-25.2 g/kg diet) were fed to the fishes for 60 days. Second, enterocyte proliferation and differentiation were assayed by culturing enterocytes with graded levels of Thr (0-275 mg/l) in vitro. Finally, enterocytes were cultured with 0 and 205 mg/l Thr to determine protein synthesis. The percent weight gain (PWG), specific growth rate, feed intake, feed efficiency, protein retention value, activities of trypsin, lipase and amylase, weights and protein contents of hepatopancreas and intestine, folds heights, activities of alkaline phosphatase (AKP), γ- glutamyl transpeptidase and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in all intestinal segments, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) activities in hepatopancreas, and 4E-BP2 gene expression in muscle, hepatopancreas and intestinal segments were significantly enhanced by Thr (p<0.05). However, the plasma ammonia concentration and TOR gene expression decreased (p<0.05). In vitro, Thr supplement significantly increased cell numbers, protein content, the activities of GOT, GPT, AKP and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, and protein synthesis rate of enterocytes, and decreased LDH activity and ammonia content in cell medium (p<0.05). In conclusion, Thr improved growth, digestive and absorptive capacity, enterocyte proliferation and differentiation, and protein synthesis and regulated TOR and 4E-BP2 gene expression in juvenile Jian carp. The dietary Thr requirement of juvenile Jian carp was 16.25 g/kg diet (51.3 g/kg protein) based on quadratic regression analysis of PWG. "
0,"The muscle is the main portion of fish that is consumed by humans. Copper (Cu) can induce oxidative damage in fish muscle. However, the effects of Cu exposure on the muscle antioxidant system and molecular patterns and preventive measures against these effects remain unclear. In this study, ROS production, enzymatic and mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling-related molecules, antioxidant response element (ARE) binding ability, DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activities were analyzed in fish muscle following Cu exposure or myo-inositol (MI) pre-administration. The results indicated that contamination due to copper exposure caused an approximately three-fold increase in ROS production, induced lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, and resulted in depletion of the glutathione (GSH) content of fish muscle. Moreover, Cu exposure caused decreases in the activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), CuZnSOD, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) that were accompanied by decreases in CuZnSOD, GPx1a, GPx1b and signaling factor protein kinase C delta mRNA levels. The decreases in the antioxidant enzyme gene mRNA levels were confirmed to be partly due to the reduced nuclear Nrf2 protein levels, poor ARE binding ability and increased caspase-3 signaling-modulated DNA fragmentation in the fish muscle. Interestingly, MI pre-treatment prevented fish muscle from Cu-induced oxidative damages mainly through increasing the GSH content, and increasing the CuZnSOD and GPx activities and corresponding mRNA levels and ARE binding ability. Taken together, our results show for the first time that Cu exposure caused oxidative damage to the muscle by decreasing the antioxidant enzyme activities via the down-regulation of the expression of genes related to the disruption of the Nrf2/ARE signaling, and this down-regulation was partially caused by caspase-3-regulated DNA fragmentation. Finally, MI protects fish against Cu toxicity. "
0,"Following the ban of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs) flame retardants under well-documented toxicity issues, organophosphate such as tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and tris(2-cloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) were considered as potential substitutes. Although TBOEP and TCEP are consistently detected in the aquatic environment, there are few data about the possible toxicological effects of these compounds on aquatic organisms, including fish. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of TBOEP and TCEP on neuro- and interrenal steroidogenesis of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), after a seven-day exposure to four different concentrations (0 (control), 0.04, 0.2 and 1mg/L) of each compound. TBOEP and TCEP were diluted in Milli-Q water. The expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis (StAR, cyp19a, cyp19b, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-hsd), and 11β-hydroxylase (cyp11β)), were analyzed in the brain and head kidney using real-time PCR. Plasma 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) analysis was performed using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Our results showed that TBOEP accumulated more rapidly than TCEP in fish muscle tissue. Surprisingly, TBOEP produced less pronounced effects than TCEP on neural and interrenal steroidogenic responses, despite the observed rapid uptake and bioaccumulation pattern. Specifically, TBOEP produced significant and consistent concentration-specific alterations on neural- and interrenal steroidogenesis. Plasma levels of 11-KT were not significantly altered by any of the exposures. The increased expression of steroidogenic genes demonstrated in the present study could produce time-specific alterations in the production of glucocorticoids and steroid hormones that play integral roles in fish metabolism, stress responses and adaptation, sexual maturation, reproduction and migration with overt consequences on reproductive success and survival."
0,"Myostatin (MSTN) is an important member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily and is a muscle growth inhibitor. In the present study, we cloned the Chinese perch MSTN cDNA sequence and analyzed its expression patterns under various conditions. The MSTN full cDNA sequence was 3347 bp long, including an open-reading frame of 1131 bp, which encoded 376 amino acids. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the MSTN shared a highly conserved signal peptide, a TGF-β functional peptide, a hydrolytic site (RARR), and nine conservative cysteine residues with other members of the TGF-β superfamily. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analyses indicated that the MSTN had a close relationship with teleostean fish, but they are far separated from mammals. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the MSTN was strongly expressed in the skeletal muscle and heart tissues. Temporal expression analysis demonstrated that the MSTN gene was expressed in very low levels, from 20 to 90 dph (post-hatching development), and was at its highest level at 150 dph (P < 0.05). The fasting-re-feeding experiment showed that the expression of the MSTN gene was initially decreased in response to a single meal, after seven days of fasting, and subsequently increased significantly, and finally decreased back to its original level. Together, our results provided valuable knowledge regarding the regulation of MSTN gene expression in Chinese perch. "
0,"High content of carotenoids in tissues of salmonid species suggests possible functional importance, which has so far remained unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of astaxanthin on performance and gene expression of sea water adapted Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fed diets with low content of marine ingredients (7.5% fishmeal and 5% fish oil). Salmon with start weight 197 g were fed two diets with identical proximate composition except for the content of astaxanthin (<1 and 48 mg/kg, respectively) for 84 days. Absence of dietary astaxanthin caused significant transcriptome changes revealed with DNA microarray. The growth rate was not optimal for the two diet groups but was not affected by dietary astaxanthin concentration. Accumulation of lipid in the intestine and liver was found in salmon fed both diets, indicating malabsorption of lipid. Salmon fed the diet without astaxanthin had larger livers and higher fat content in liver due to accumulation of triglycerides, but the difference in fat content was not significant. Transcriptome responses in different organs suggested that lack of dietary astaxanthin may have functional consequences in salmon fed low marine diets. In the intestine of astaxanthin deprived salmon, decreased expression was observed in a suite of immune genes including genes of innate antiviral immunity, transporters and enzymes of glycan metabolism. Transcriptome responses in liver suggested effect of absence of astaxanthin on lipid metabolism and especially on increased biosynthesis of terpenoids and steroids and only minor effects on immune genes. The greatest transcriptome changes were observed in skeletal muscle in the absence of astaxanthin, with an up-regulation of immune-related genes (119) and multiple genes with well-established association with stress. The condition resembled a mild inflammation of the muscle. Small or moderate scale of gene expression changes were in concordance with equal growth performance of fish fed both diets, however their character may indicate potential risk of absence of dietary carotenoids."
0,"In fish, intramuscular (i.m) injection of plasmid DNA encoding viral proteins has proved a highly effective vaccination strategy against some viral pathogens. The efficacy of DNA vaccination in teleost fish is based on the high level of viral antigen expression in muscle cells inducing a strong and long-lasting protection. However, the mechanisms through which this protection is established and effectuated in fish are still not fully understood. Moreover, similarities to mammalian models cannot be established since DNA vaccination in mammals usually induces much weaker responses. In this work, we have focused on the characterization of the immune cells that infiltrate the muscle at the site of DNA injection in vaccinated fish and the chemokines and chemokine receptors that may be involved in their infiltration. We have demonstrated through diverse techniques that B lymphocytes, both IgM⁺ and IgT⁺ cells, represented a major infiltrating cell type in fish vaccinated with a viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) glycoprotein-encoding DNA vaccine, whereas in control fish injected with an oil adjuvant mainly granulocyte/monocyte-type cells were attracted. Among twelve chemokine genes studied, only CXCL11_L1, CK5B and CK6 mRNA levels were up-regulated in DNA vaccinated fish compared to fish injected with the corresponding vector backbone. Furthermore, the transcription of CXCR3B, a possible receptor for CXCL11_L1 was also significantly up-regulated in vaccinated fish. Finally, experiments performed with recombinant trout CK5B and CK6 and chemokine expression plasmids revealed that these chemokines have chemotactic capacities which might explain the recruitment of B cells to the site of DNA injection. Altogether, our results reveal that there is an early chemokine-related B cell recruitment triggered by i.m. DNA vaccination against VHSV which might play an important role in the initial phase of the immune response."
0,"Mammalian secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is the primary regulator of cell shape and cell adhesion to fibronectin. We, for the first time, report the complete sequencing of SPARC cDNA from orange-spotted grouper. Despite the difference in the lengths of the SPARC transcripts, all of the SPARC molecules encoded a signal peptide, follistain-like copper binding sequence (KGHK) domain, and extracellular domain. The grouper SPARC gene was differentially expressed in vivo and contributed differently to high-level expression of SPARC in muscle. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated a decreased level of SPARC in nodavirus-infected grouper compared with healthy grouper. Comparative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses of eye tissues of viral nervous necrosis grouper and healthy grouper were performed. Recombinant SPARC produced changes in grouper cell shape 24 h after treatment. The results provide new insight into the pathogenesis of nodavirus, and demonstrate an experimental rationale for SPARC characterization in nodavirus-infected grouper."
0,"Animal communication systems are subject to natural selection so the imprint of selection must reside in the genome of each species. Electric fish generate electric organ discharges (EODs) from a muscle-derived electric organ (EO) and use these fields for electrolocation and communication. Weakly electric teleosts have evolved at least twice (mormyriforms, gymnotiforms) allowing a comparison of the workings of evolution in two independently evolved sensory/motor systems. We focused on the genes for two Na(+) channels, Nav1.4a and Nav1.4b, which are orthologs of the mammalian muscle-expressed Na(+) channel gene Nav1.4. Both genes are expressed in muscle in non-electric fish. Nav1.4b is expressed in muscle in electric fish, but Nav1.4a expression has been lost from muscle and gained in the evolutionarily novel EO in both groups. We hypothesized that Nav1.4a might be evolving to optimize the EOD for different sensory environments and the generation of species-specific communication signals. We obtained the sequence for Nav1.4a from non-electric, mormyriform and gymnotiform species, estimated a phylogenetic tree, and determined rates of evolution. We observed elevated rates of evolution in this gene in both groups coincident with the loss of Nav1.4a from muscle and its compartmentalization in EO. We found amino acid substitutions at sites known to be critical for channel inactivation; analyses suggest that these changes are likely to be the result of positive selection. We suggest that the diversity of EOD waveforms in both groups of electric fish is correlated with accelerations in the rate of evolution of the Nav1.4a Na(+) channel gene due to changes in selection pressure on the gene once it was solely expressed in the EO."
0,"To investigate the endocrine signalling from dietary plant protein on somatotropic system and gastrointestinal hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), two iso-amino acid diets based on either high plant or high fish meal protein were fed to Atlantic salmon. Salmon with an average starting weight of 641+/-23 g (N=180), were fed a fish meal (FM) based diet (containing 40% FM) or diets mainly consisting of blended plant proteins (PP) containing only 13% marine protein, of which only 5% was FM for 3 months. mRNA levels of target genes GH, GH-R, IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, IGF-IR in addition to CCK-L, were studied in brain, hepatic tissue and fast muscle, and circulating levels of IGF-I in plasma of Atlantic salmon were measured. We detected reduced feed intake resulting in lower growth, weight gain and muscle protein accretion in salmon fed plant protein compared to a diet based on fish meal. There were no significant effects on the regulation of the target genes in brain or in hepatic tissues, but a trend of down-regulation of IGF-I was detected in fast muscle. Lower feed intake, and therefore lower intake of the indispensable amino acids, may have resulted in lower pituitary GH and lower IGF-I mRNA levels in muscle tissues. This, together with higher protein catabolism, may be the main cause of the reduced growth of salmon fed plant protein diet. There were no signalling effects detected either by the minor differences of the diets on mRNA levels of GH, GH-R, IGF-IR, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, CCK or plasma protein IGF-I."
0,"Lysozymes are important defense proteins of the innate immune system and possess high antibacterial activities. In the present study, a full-length c-type lysozyme cDNA (HtLysC) was cloned and characterized from taimen (Hucho taimen, Pallas). The cDNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 432 bp encoding 143 amino acid (aa), with 97% identity to LysC of Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The amino acid sequence possessed a LYZ1 domain (16-140 aa) which contained two conserved residues (Glu 50 and Asp 67), eight conserved cysteine residues and a calcium binding site. RT-PCR analysis showed that HtLysC transcripts were most abundant in liver and less in muscle. The expression of HtLysC was up-regulated in the liver when challenged with Yersinia ruckeri. The recombinant HtLysC (rHtLysC) had lytic activities against Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Aeromonas salmonicida and Y. ruckeri. Enzyme assay showed that the optimal temperature and pH of rHtLysC were 55 °C and 6.0, respectively. Taken together, these results indicated that HtLysC might play an important role in innate immune defense against bacterial pathogens as a functional lysozyme."
0,"The aim of this study was to characterise a primary cell culture isolated from fast skeletal muscle of the gilthead sea bream. Gene expression profiles during culture maturation were compared with those obtained from a fasting-refeeding model which is widely used to modulate myogenesis in vivo. Myogenesis is controlled by numerous extracellular signals together with intracellular transcriptional factors whose coordinated expression is critical for the appropriate development of muscle fibres. Full-length cDNAs for the transcription factors Myf5, Mrf4, Pax7 and Sox8 were cloned and sequenced for gilthead sea bream. Pax7, sox8, myod2 and myf5 levels were up-regulated during the proliferating phase of the myogenic cultures coincident with the highest expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In contrast, myogenin and mrf4 transcript abundance was highest during the differentiation phase of the culture when myotubes were present, and was correlated with increased myosin heavy chain (mhc) and desmin expression. In vivo, 30days of fasting resulted in muscle fibre atrophy, a reduction in myod2, myf5 and igf1 expression, lower number of Myod-positive cells, and decreased PCNA protein expression, whereas myogenin expression was not significantly affected. Myostatin1 (mstn1) and pax7 expression were up-regulated in fasted relative to well-fed individuals, consistent with a role for Pax7 in the reduction of myogenic cell activity with fasting. The primary cell cultures and fasting-feeding experiments described provide a foundation for the future investigations on the regulation of muscle growth in gilthead sea bream. "
0,"The aim of this study was to investigate application of fish protein hydrolysates (FPHs) as cryoprotectants for cod fish mince subjected to freeze-thaw abuse. Response surface methodology revealed little difference in cryoprotectant ability between FPHs produced from Pacific hake muscle within the range of conditions studied, namely Flavourzyme® enzyme/substrate ratio (E/S 1-4%), time (1-6h) and pH (5-7). When added at 4% or higher concentrations, FPH minimized expressible moisture and cook loss, while maximizing salt extractable protein from freeze-thaw abused fish mince, providing similar or better cryoprotection compared to an 8% sucrose-sorbitol blend, and a stabilizing effect of FPH on myosin was observed by differential scanning calorimetry. Sensory evaluation showed that addition of 8% FPH in fish ball products increased the perception of fishiness, saltiness, bitterness and firmness while decreasing moistness. FPH could be a viable alternative to the sugar-based cryoprotectants currently used for frozen fish products."
0,"Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) is a reovirus that has predominantly been detected in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). PRV is associated with heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in farmed Atlantic salmon, and recently erythrocytes were identified as major target cells. The study of PRV replication and pathogenesis of the infection has been impeded by the inability to propagate PRV in vitro. In this study we developed an ex vivo cultivation system for PRV in Atlantic salmon erythrocytes. PRV was successfully passaged to naïve erythrocytes using lysates of blood cells from infected salmon. During cultivation a significant increase in viral load was observed by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry, which coincided with the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions. The inclusions resembled viral factories and contained both PRV protein and dsRNA. In addition, the erythrocytes generated an antiviral immune gene activation after PRV infection, with significant up-regulation of IFN-α, RIG-I, Mx and PKR transcripts. Supernatants from the first passage successfully transmitted virus to naïve erythrocytes. This study demonstrates that PRV replicates in Atlantic salmon erythrocytes ex vivo. The ex vivo infection model closely reflects the situation in vivo and can be used to study the infection and replication mechanisms of PRV, as well as the antiviral immune responses of salmonid erythrocytes.

0,"Mercury has the ability to bind to a variety of biomolecules, which can compromise its structure and functionality and thus promote its toxic effects. The aim of this study is to identify possible mercury biomarkers in muscle samples of Plagioscion squamosissimus (carnivorous fish) and Colossoma macropomum (omnivorous fish), from the Amazon region. The muscle proteome of fish species was separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), and the total mercury concentrations in protein spots were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). The protein spots containing mercury were characterized by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The mercury concentrations in the protein spots were in the range of 1.10 ± 0.02-23.90 ± 0.33 μg g<sup>-1</sup>. The proteins phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (P. squamosissimus), hemoglobin β and cytochrome P450scc (C. macropomum), identified by ESI-MS/MS and showing the highest values of mercury concentration, may be considered possible mercury biomarkers."
0,"During certain stages in an animal's life cycle, energy requirements may exceed energy intake from the diet. The spawning migration of temperate eels is a textbook example of negative energy balance, forcing these fish to rely on stored fats (triacylglycerides) to provide their muscles with energy for swimming and their growing oocytes with the nutrients needed to develop and support healthy offspring. We predicted broad implications of this great need for endogenous triacylglycerides in terms of their packaging, transport, and ovarian uptake. To test this, serum lipid concentrations and transcript abundances of intestinal and hepatic triacylglyceride packagers and ovarian triacylglyceride modifiers and receivers were investigated throughout previtellogenesis (feeding phase) and into early vitellogenesis (fasting phase) in short-finned eels. A switch from exogenous to endogenous triacylglyceride packaging was seen as the liver upregulated transcript levels of apolipoprotein B and microsomal triacylglyceride transport protein and downregulated those of apolipoprotein E and lipoprotein lipase. In the intestine, the reverse response was observed. Furthermore, ovarian transcript abundances of triacylglyceride modifiers and receivers increased (apolipoprotein E, lipoprotein lipase, and vitellogenin receptor), indicative of increased triacylglyceride uptake during previtellogenesis. We propose that increased hepatic apolipoprotein B production is a conserved vertebrate response to prolonged periods of negative energy balance. "
0,"Red-spotted grouper (Epinephelus akaara) is one of the high economic value grouper species, however, the knowledge regarding its growth is limited. In this study, full-length cDNAs of growth hormone (gh) and its receptors (ghr1 and ghr2) were cloned from the pituitary and liver of red-spotted grouper, respectively. Tissue distribution analysis showed that gh mRNA was predominantly expressed in the pituitary. ghr1 mRNA was highly expressed in the liver, muscle, fat and gonad, while ghr2 mRNA expression was ubiquitously high in the peripheral tissues. However, the mRNA expression of both ghr isoforms was relatively low in the central nervous system. Secretory recombinant grouper GH (rgGH) was expressed in yeast Pichia pastoris and verified. HEK293T cells transiently transfected with the GHR isoforms were used to elucidate the receptor-mediated signaling pathways related to growth regulation. rgGH activated rapid phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 through GHR1, but only STAT5 was phosphorylated via GHR2. rgGH strongly activated STAT5 phosphorylation and significantly stimulated ghr1, ghr2 and insulin-like growth factor (igf1, igf2) mRNA expression in primary cultured hepatocytes. Data showed that the recombinant protein rgGH played effects on igf1/2 mRNA expression via GHR-mediated signaling pathways. Our findings provide essential information about GH and GHRs characteristics in red-spotted grouper."
0,"Chemokines are a class of small molecular weight cytokines of 6-14 kDa, exerting important roles in the regulation of various inflammatory diseases and immune cell migration. In this study, we have identified the CXCL12 gene from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), including CXCL12a (OnCXCL12a) and CXCL12b (OnCXCL12b). The open reading frames of OnCXCL12a and OnCXCL12b are 309 and 297 bp, encoding 102 and 98 amino acids, respectively. Multiple alignment showed that OnCXCL12a and OnCXCL12b have characteristics of CXC chemokines and share high identity with CXCL12 amino acid sequences from the known species. Tissue distribution in the healthy fish indicated that OnCXCL12a and OnCXCL12b expressed in all examined tissues, with the highest expression in muscle and anterior kidney, respectively. After challenged by Streptococcus agalactiae, Poly(I:C) and LPS in vivo and in vitro, OnCXCL12 is transcriptionally up-regulated in immune tissues and cells significantly. The recombinant OnCXCL12 proteins, (r)OnCXCL12a and (r)OnCXCL12b, enhance the release of nitric oxide and increase the expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10) in anterior kidney leukocytes, as well as exhibit chemotactic activity for leukocytes from anterior kidney. Summarizing, these results indicate that OnCXCL12 is involved in the immune response of Nile tilapia against pathogen infection and may play an important role in mediating inflammatory response."
0,"Fish hemoglobins (Hbs) frequently contain glycine at site E14 while mammalian Hbs contain larger residues (e.g., alanine and serine). These differences were examined by creating structural variants at E14 using recombinant bovine myoglobin (Mb) as a model heme protein that contains alanine at E14. The Ala(E14)Gly mutation increased k(ox) and hemin loss 3-fold and 45-fold, respectively. Glycine at E14 creates a channel for solvent to enter the heme crevice, which enhances autoxidation and hemin loss rates. Hydration of the proximal heme pocket facilitates hemin loss because protonation of the proximal histidine weakens the linkage of the imidazole group to the iron atom of the hemin moiety. Ala(E14)Gly promoted lipid oxidation in washed fish muscle more rapidly during iced storage compared to wild type Mb at pH 5.7. This suggested that the rapid hemin loss from Ala(E14)Gly accelerated lipid oxidation. Ala(E14)Ser and Ala(E14)Val had little effect on k(ox) but somewhat accelerated net hemin loss. These studies suggest that enhanced access of solvent to the heme crevice of many fish Hbs at site E14 facilitates rapid hemin loss and moderately accelerates autoxidation. This likely is part of the reason fish Hbs promote lipid oxidation much more effectively compared to mammalian Hbs."
0,"Myostatin, through type I receptor (kinase 4, 5, ALK4/5), functions to participate in the immune system and negatively regulate muscle growth in mammals. However, the role of myostatin (mstn) in the immune system of teleosts is largely unknown. In a previous study, we cloned the mstn1 cDNA encoding myostatin in Qi river crucian carp (Carassius auratus). In the present study, we have cloned mstn2 cDNA, which was characterized and analyzed together with mstn1. Tissue distribution analysis showed that both mstn genes are expressed in numerous tissues, with mstn1 dominantly expressed in the muscle and brain, whereas mstn2 is mainly expressed in the brain. During embryogenesis, mstn1 and mstn2 exhibit different expression patterns. Both mstn1 and mstn2 expression increased stepwise in the brain at different developmental stages. Furthermore, both genes are differentially regulated during different periods of fasting/re-feeding. Following the exposure of C. auratus to polyI:C, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and Aeromonas hydrophila, both genes were upregulated in different tissues, which indicated that they might be involved in the immune response against pathogenic invasion. Blocking the Mstn signal pathway with SB-431542 (a chemical inhibitor of ALK4/5) resulted in significantly increased body length and weight. However, the mortality of SB-431542-treated fish was higher after A. hydrophila challenge. Moreover, decreased expression of lysozymes (lyz), complement component 3 (c3), β-defensin 3 (defb3), and interferon γ (ifnγ) were exhibited in treated fish, compared with the controls. Furthermore, the expression of nf-κb1, three pro-inflammatory cytokines (il1β, il6, and tnfα), and inflammatory cytokines (il8 and il10) were significantly increased in both the SB-431542-treated group and the control after A. hydrophila infection, suggesting that the NF-κB pathway was not suppressed in the SB-431542-treated fish. Taken together, our data suggest that both mstn1 and mstn2 play important roles in early body development, muscle growth, and the immune system by acting downstream of the NF-κB signal pathway."
0,"Calpains (CAPNs) belong to the papain superfamily of cysteine proteases, and they are calcium-dependent cytoplasmic cysteine proteases that regulate a variety of physiological processes. We obtained the sequence of CAPN3 from an NGS-based analysis of Pagrus major (PmCAPN3) and confirmed the conserved molecular biological properties in the predicted amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence and predicted domains of CAPN3 were found to be highly conserved in all of the examined species, and one catalytic domain and four calcium binding sites were identified. In healthy P. major, the PmCAPN3 mRNA was most abundantly expressed in the muscle and skin, and ubiquitously expressed in the other tissues used in the experiment. After artificial infections with fish pathogens, significant changes in its expression levels were found in immune-related tissues, most of showed upregulation. In particular, the highest level of expression was found in the liver, a tissue associated with protease activity. Taken together, these results suggest a physiological activity for PmCAPN3 in P. major and reveal functional possibilities that have not yet been reported in the immune system."
0,"Neuromedin S (NMS) has been demonstrated to have important roles in many vertebrate physiological processes. However, the function of NMS in teleost fishes remains unclear. We explored the physiological roles of the NMS gene in the zebrafish model. An NMS cDNA was cloned from zebrafish brain tissue, and the full-length cDNA sequence was 521 bp in length and encoded a precursor of 110 amino acid residues. Interestingly, fish prepro-NMS is predicted to generate a short 34-residue peptide, designated as NMS-related peptide (NMSRP). Zebrafish prepro-NMS does not contain the NMS peptide which is found in the NMS precursors of mammals, and just retains the MNSRP peptide. A multiple-species sequence alignment showed that NMSRPs are conserved among the other sampled vertebrates. Zebrafish NMS mRNA was detected by RT-PCR revealing a tissue-specific distribution with high levels of expression in the brain, spleen, ovary, pituitary, and muscle. Furthermore, the locations of NMS-expressing cells in the zebrafish brain were detected by in situ hybridization in the parvocellular preoptic nucleus (PPa), the ventral zone of the periventricular hypothalamus (Hv), and lateral hypothalamic nucleus (LH). The levels of NMS mRNA in the hypothalamus were significantly increased after three days of food deprivation. Administration of zebrafish NMSRP by intraperitoneal injection significantly promoted the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexin, suggesting an orexigenic role for NMSRP in zebrafish. The present study offers a new understanding of the NMS gene in vertebrates and increases our knowledge of the neuroendocrine regulation of feeding. "
0,"The limited activity of Δ6 fatty acid desaturase (FAD6) on α-linolenic (ALA, 18:3n-3) and linoleic (LA, 18:2n-6) acids in marine fish alters the long-chain (≥C(20)) polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) concentration in fish muscle and liver when vegetable oils replace fish oil (FO) in aquafeeds. Echium oil (EO), rich in stearidonic acid (SDA, 18:4n-3) and γ-linoleic acid (GLA, 18:3n-6), may enhance the biosynthesis of n-3 and n-6 LC-PUFA by bypassing the rate-limiting FAD6 step. Nutritional and environmental modulation of the mechanisms in LC-PUFA biosynthesis was examined in barramundi, Lates calcarifer , a tropical euryhaline fish. Juveniles were maintained in either freshwater or seawater and fed different dietary LC-PUFA precursors present in EO or rapeseed oil (RO) and compared with FO. After 8 weeks, growth of fish fed EO was slower compared to the FO and RO treatments. Irrespective of salinity, expression of the FAD6 and elongase was up-regulated in fish fed EO and RO diets, but did not lead to significant accumulation of LC-PUFA in the neutral lipid of fish tissues as occurred in the FO treatment. However, significant concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6), but not docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), appeared in liver and, to a lesser extent, in muscle of fish fed EO with marked increases in the phospholipid fraction. Fish in the EO treatment had higher EPA and ARA in their liver phospholipids than fish fed FO. Endogenous conversion of dietary precursors into neutral lipid LC-PUFA appears to be limited by factors other than the initial rate-limiting step. In contrast, phospholipid LC-PUFA had higher biosynthesis, or selective retention, in barramundi fed EO rather than RO."
0,"Giant groupers, the largest grouper type in the world, are of economic importance in marine aquaculture for their rapid growth. At the same time, bacterial and viral diseases have become the main threats to the grouper industry. Here, we report a high-quality genome of a giant grouper sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq X-Ten and PacBio Bioscience Sequel platform. A total of 254 putative antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes were identified, which can be divided into 34 classes according to the annotation of the Antimicrobial Peptides Database (APD3). Their locations in pseudochromosomes were also determined. Thrombin-, lectin-, and scolopendin-derived putative AMPs were the three largest parts. In addition, expressions of putative AMPs were measured by our transcriptome data. Two putative AMP genes (<i>gapdh1</i> and <i>gapdh2</i>) were involved in glycolysis, which had extremely high expression levels in giant grouper muscle. As it has been reported that AMPs inhibit the growth of a broad spectrum of microbes and participate in regulating innate and adaptive immune responses, genome sequencing of this study provides a comprehensive cataloging of putative AMPs of groupers, supporting antimicrobial research and aquaculture therapy. These genomic resources will be beneficial to further molecular breeding of this economically important fish."
0,"The gene encoding HSP70 was isolated from Microptenus salmoides by homologous cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The HSP70 transcripts were 2116 bp long and contained 1953 open reading frames encoding proteins of 650 amino acids with a molecular mass of 71.2 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point of 5.22. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the HSP70 gene was differentially expressed in various tissues under normal conditions, and the highest HSP70 level was observed in the spleen and the lowest levels in the muscle and heart. The clear time-dependent expression level of HSP70 was observed after bacterial challenge and heat stress. A significant increase in HSP70 expression level was detected and reached a maximum at 3 h and 6 h in liver, spleens and gill tissues after Aeromonas hydrophila infection and heat stress, respectively (P < 0.05). As time progressed, the expression of HSP70 transcript was downregulated and mostly dropped back to the original level at 48 h. The concentration of cortisol, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased as the time of stress progressed, with the highest level found on 3 h and later declined rapidly and reached to the control levels at the 48 h. Those results suggested that HSP70 was involved in the immune response to bacterial challenge and heat stress. The cloning and expression analysis of the HSP70 provide theoretical basis to further study the mechanism of anti-adverseness in Microptenus salmoides."
0,"The Gadd45aa and Gadd45 ab genes are members of the Gadd45 family, which are critically involved in immunological and apoptosis functions. In this study, we isolated and characterized Gadd45aa and Gadd45 ab cDNA from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) (designated CiGadd45aa and CiGadd45 ab). The CiGadd45aa and CiGadd45 ab fragments spanned 1272 bp/1248 bp, which contained 474 bp/480 bp open reading frames encoding 157/159 amino acid proteins. BLAST analysis revealed that CiGadd45aa and CiGadd45 ab shared high similarity with known Gadd45a sequences. qRT-PCR analysis showed widespread and abundant expression of CiGadd45aa in gill, intestine, kidney, brain, blood, skin and fin, but low in liver, spleen, head kidney, heart, and muscle. CiGadd45 ab was expressed highly in liver, spleen and blood but at low levels in gill, intestine, kidney, head kidney, heart, brain, skin, muscle, and fin. Following challenge of grass carp with Aeromonas hydrophila, CiGadd45aa and CiGadd45 ab expression was upregulated. In immune-relevant tissues and MAPK family genes (p38, JNK and ERK) were upregulated by CiGadd45aa and CiGadd45 ab overexpression and partly downregulated by interfered in the CIK grass carp kidney cell line. In addition, transcription of the cytokine-encoding il-8 gene was upregulated/downregulated by CiGadd45aa and CiGadd45 ab overexpression and interference. These results suggest that CiGadd45aa and CiGadd45 ab play roles in innate immune responses against A. hydrophila in grass carp."
0,"Teleosts of the genus Seriola, commonly known as amberjacks, are of high commercial value in international markets due to their flesh quality and worldwide distribution. The Seriola species of interest to Mediterranean aquaculture is the greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili). This species holds great potential for the aquaculture industry, but in captivity, reproduction has proved to be challenging, and observed growth dysfunction hinders their domestication. Insights into molecular mechanisms may contribute to a better understanding of traits like growth and sex, but investigations to unravel the molecular background of amberjacks have begun only recently."
1,"Illumina HiSeq sequencing generated a high-coverage greater amberjack genome sequence comprising 45 909 scaffolds. Comparative mapping to the Japanese yellowtail (Seriola quinqueriadiata) and to the model species medaka (Oryzias latipes) allowed the generation of in silico groups. Additional gonad transcriptome sequencing identified sex-biased transcripts, including known sex-determining and differentiation genes. Investigation of the muscle transcriptome of slow-growing individuals showed that transcripts involved in oxygen and gas transport were differentially expressed compared with fast/normal-growing individuals. On the other hand, transcripts involved in muscle functions were found to be enriched in fast/normal-growing individuals."
2,"The present study provides the first insights into the molecular background of male and female amberjacks and of fast- and slow-growing fish. Therefore, valuable molecular resources have been generated in the form of a first draft genome and a reference transcriptome. Sex-biased genes, which may also have roles in sex determination or differentiation, and genes that may be responsible for slow growth are suggested."
0,"The aim of this study was to determine differences among volatile compounds composition of Senegalese sole muscle fed with extruded diets containing different plant protein (PP) and vegetable oil (VO) sources. Two set of experiments were performed on growing sole. One growth trial used a control diet containing fish meal (FM) as the main protein source and different PP-based diets. Another growth trial compared a control diet containing fish oil (FO) as the main lipid source and different VO-based diets; after a period, all sole were fed with the FO diet. Results showed that the incorporation of PP sources up to 75% allowed the production of a similar content of major volatile compounds to the control diet. In VO-based diets, some significant differences were found in the levels of some volatile compounds in sole muscle; however, no significant differences were obtained through sensory evaluation. "
0,"A functional understanding of processes involved in adaptive divergence is one of the awaiting opportunities afforded by high-throughput transcriptomic technologies. Functional analysis of coexpressed genes has succeeded in the biomedical field in identifying key drivers of disease pathways. However, in ecology and evolutionary biology, functional interpretation of transcriptomic data is still limited. Here, we used Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of coexpressed genes in muscle and brain tissue of a lake whitefish backcross progeny. Modules were connected to gradients of known adaptive traits involved in the ecological speciation process between benthic and limnetic ecotypes. Key drivers, that is, hub genes of functional modules related to reproduction, growth, and behavior were identified, and module preservation was assessed in natural populations. Using this approach, we identified modules of coexpressed genes involved in phenotypic divergence and their key drivers, and further identified a module part specifically rewired in the backcross progeny. Functional analysis of transcriptomic data can significantly contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying ecological speciation. Our findings point to bone morphogenetic protein and calcium signaling as common pathways involved in coordinated evolution of trophic behavior, trophic morphology (gill rakers), and reproduction. Results also point to pathways implicating hemoglobins and constitutive stress response (HSP70) governing growth in lake whitefish."
0,"This study investigated the biochemical changes (proteins degradation, total volatile basic nitrogen, biogenic amines, volatile organic compounds, nucleotides catabolism and related enzymes) of bighead carp samples inoculated with four different bacteria (Shewanella putrefaciens, Aeromonas sobria, Acinetobacter bohemicus, and Pseudomonas helmanticensis) during storage at 4 ± 1 °C. A. sobria exhibited the strongest proteolytic activity. A. sobria, P. helmanticensis, and S. putrefaciens were responsible for putrescine production, whereas S. putrefaciens was the sole producer of cadaverine. Alcohols and S-compounds were mainly released by A. sobria and S. putrefaciens, respectively. The fastest degradation rates of hypoxanthine riboside and hypoxanthine were found in samples inoculated with P. helmanticensis and S. putrefaciens. Inosine nucleosidase was mainly resulted by A. sobria, P. helmanticensis and S. putrefaciens, whereas xanthine oxidase was derived from both fish muscle and secretions of P. helmanticensis and S. putrefaciens."
0,"In the present study, we analyzed endocrine and nutritional regulation of fatty acid (FA) transporters mRNA expression fatty acid transport protein (FATP1) and fatty acid translocase (CD36) in rainbow trout in vivo and in adipocytes and myocytes in vitro. The expression of FATP1 increased with adipocyte and that of CD36 with myocyte in vitro differentiation suggesting a different role for each transporter during the two cell differentiation programs. Food deprivation (15, 25 and 35 days) increased FATP1 and CD36 mRNA expression in white muscle, red muscle and adipose tissue while insulin administration decreased the FATP1 expression in adipose tissue in vivo (21.6 pmol/g body mass) and in vitro (1 μM) in adipocytes. In trout myotubes insulin (1 μM) decreased FATP1 and increased CD36 mRNA expression. Thus, regulation of FA transporters expression by insulin is complex and directed to specific tissue needs. Although FATP1 and CD36 mRNA levels are controlled by insulin, it appears that FATP1 respond more clearly to situations of hyper and hypo-insulinemia in trout muscle and adipose tissue than CD36. FATP1 and CD36 transcription was also modulated by growth hormone in cultured myotubes and isolated adipocytes. Lipopolysaccharide administration (E. coli, serotype O26:B6, 6 μg/g body mass) decreased FATP1 mRNA expression in red muscle, adipose tissue and liver after 24h according to changes in lipid metabolism during infection. Tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) (100 ng/ml) reduced FATP1 expression in isolated adipocytes. Further, insulin (1μM) and IGF-I (100 nM) increased the FA uptake in rainbow trout myotubes through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Overall, we demonstrated not only that feeding condition regulates FATP1 and CD36 mRNA expression in a tissue-specific manner, but also that insulin is an important regulator of these genes in vivo and in vitro and also it stimulates FA uptake in trout muscle cells."
0,"Transcriptomic studies are facilitating the search for the molecular bases of adaptation in natural populations, but the impact of these differences in mRNA content on animal physiology are often unknown. One way to determine if molecular changes have the potential to influence animal physiology and performance is to test for correlated changes at higher levels of biological organization, including enzyme activity. Here, we measure the activities of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes to test if previously documented genetic and transcriptomic variation between 'dwarf' and 'normal' Lake Whitefish ecotypes are associated with corresponding changes in enzyme activity (measured as maximal rate, V<sub>max</sub>) in liver and skeletal muscle. We use laboratory-reared fish from the same populations as prior transcriptomic studies and find that white muscle mRNA content is a good predictor of glycolytic and glycogen metabolism enzyme activity, and dwarf whitefish have evolved higher activities than normal whitefish. However, the differences in hepatic mRNA content found between ecotypes in prior studies are not associated with comparable changes in enzyme activity. For example, dwarf whitefish have lower enzyme activities, but higher transcript abundances for two glycolytic enzymes compared to normal whitefish. Overall, we find that transcriptomic studies successfully highlight evolutionary variation in enzyme activities, but not always in the direction predicted, indicating that a variety of tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms contributed to the evolution of energy metabolism in Lake Whitefish."
0,"Gobionellus oceanicus is a species widely distributed on the Atlantic coast and may be susceptible to anthropic effects. This study evaluated the morphology and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity of G. oceanicus gills considering the concentration of metals in the fish and Subaé River estuary. Although the metal concentrations detected in the water and sediment did not exceed certain limits, CONAMA (Brazilian Environment Council), TEL (Threshold Effect Level), and PEL (Probable Effect Level), the metals levels in gills plus muscle and skin of G. oceanicus were above the permitted setting of the Ministry of Health, Brazil. The pavement epithelial cells (PVC) of the gill filament was observed that there were long microridges either in the apical surface or in the lamella; especially, microridges degeneration was shown in some PVC from filament epithelium. The number of ionocyte and the volume density were (0.02 ± 0.001)/μm and (0.38 ± 0.27) %, respectively. The activity of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was 1.13 ± 0.76 μM Pi mg protein<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. We describe the volume density and number of ionocytes and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase enzymatic activity in G. oceanicus for the first time, which is useful for basic and comparative future studies to support aquatic biomonitoring."
0,"In this study, the dicer gene (designated as cidicer) was identified and characterized from grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella. The complementary DNA (cDNA) of cidicer contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 5646 nucleotides (nts) encoding a putative protein of 1881 amino acids (aa). The deduced Dicer protein contained all known functional domains identified in other organisms. Tissue tropism analysis indicated that cidicer is abundantly expressed in brain, gill, head kidney, liver, spleen, heart, muscle and intestine. In the C. idella kidney (CIK) cells, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of cidicer was significantly up-regulated at 24 h (6·36-fold, P < 0·01) after grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection, and its transcriptional expression level was also transiently induced to a high level (6·54-fold, P < 0·01) at 2 h post-stimulation of synthetic double-stranded polyinosinic-polycytidylic potassium salt [poly(I:C)]. In vivo analysis further showed that the expression of cidicer mRNA in the liver was induced to a significantly high level at 12 h (8·46-fold, P < 0·01), and then dropped to normal level at 72 h post-challenge with GCRV. The transcriptional expression pattern of cidicer in the spleen tissue was similar to that of liver tissue upon GCRV challenge. These results collectively implied that the identified cidicer was an inducible gene responding to viral infection both in vitro and in vivo, and the data would shed light on the interaction between RNA interference (RNAi) antiviral pathway and aquareovirus infection.

0,"The experiment aimed to measure post-prandial protein synthesis at three different temperatures. Juvenile barramundi (10.81+/-3.46 g) were held at 21, 27 and 33 degrees C and fed to satiation daily. Samples were taken over a 24h period at 0 (24h after the previous meal) and then at 4, 8, 12 and 24h after feeding to measure protein synthesis in the white muscle, liver and remaining carcass. Protein synthesis at 27 and 33 degrees C peaked 4h after feeding in all tissues and returned to pre-feeding rates by 12h. At 21 degrees C protein synthesis remained constant over 24h in all tissues. While the concentration of RNA remained stable over the 24h cycle and across temperatures, the ribosomal activity increased after feeding. This meant k(RNA), not the absolute amount of RNA, was the driving force underlying the post-prandial increase in protein synthesis. However, relative differences in protein synthesis between tissues were attributed to differences in RNA concentration. There was a significant positive relationship between white muscle and whole body protein synthesis. This was the first study to show an interaction between temperature and the time after feeding on protein synthesis for an ectotherm, and that a post-prandial peak in protein synthesis only occurred under optimum temperature conditions."
0,"Due to the substantial photosynthetic biomass in their habitat, salmonids such as the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) can be subject to hyperoxia in addition to high temperatures associated with climate change. Both stressful conditions increase the incidence of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). The mitochondrial association of hexokinase has been shown to increase in the hearts of certain fish experiencing hypoxia in a putative cardioprotective response to oxidative stress. In this study, the mitochondrial association of hexokinase I (HKI) and markers of oxidative damage and metabolic stress were probed to elucidate the cardioprotective role of hexokinase in the rainbow trout. Results showed that the co-administration of hyperoxia and hyperthermia increased the ventricular mitochondrially-bound fraction of HKI, whereas exposure to hyperthermia in normoxia had no effect; in the combined condition there was little evidence of increased stress. A second in vitro study using ventricular strips and isolated cardiomyocytes was undertaken to reconcile the cardioprotective role of HK in the rainbow trout with findings in mammalian studies, confirming that mitochondrial association of HK maintains aerobic efficiency and inhibits apoptosis. Finally, protein sequence analysis suggested that the physiological contributions of HKI and HKII in salmonids vary from those in mammals, further explaining the dynamic nature of the traditionally-inert HKI. Together, these findings help to explain the broader functions of HKI in the salmonid heart, and illustrate the role of complex environmental conditions in defining physiological responses."
0,"Understanding the effects of dietary carbohydrates on transcription factors that regulate myogenesis provides insight into the role of nutrient sensing by satellite cells towards myocyte differentiation. We evaluated the influence of dietary carbohydrate level (0, 15, 25 or 35%) on the temporal mRNA expression patterns (4, 8 or 12 weeks) of transcription factors that regulate satellite cell myocyte addition (MA) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), a vertebrate with indeterminate growth. Relative to the 0% carbohydrate (NC) diet, 15 (IC-15) and 25% (IC-25) carbohydrate containing diets significantly up-regulate MyoD and Myf5, but not Pax7, after 12 weeks of feeding. Simultaneously, the Pax7/MyoD mRNA expression ratio declined significantly with both the IC diets. Myogenin mRNA expression also increased in rainbow trout (RBT) fed the IC-15 diet. The high carbohydrate (HC) diet (35%) attenuated the increased mRNA expression of these transcription factors. It is of note that the 4 and 8 week samples lacked the promyogenic expression patterns. The myogenic gene expression in fish fed the IC-15 diet for 12 weeks indicate a transcriptional signature that reflects increased satellite cell myogenesis. Our results suggest a potential role for satellite cells in the nutrient sensing ability of a vertebrate with indeterminate skeletal muscle growth."
0,"Betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT, EC 2.1.1.5) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from betaine to homocysteines (Hcy) to form dimethylglycine and Met, respectively. A full-length cDNA of the BHMT in Lateolabrax japonicus was amplified using RT-PCR and SMART RACE methods. The cDNA of the BHMT in L. japonicus is 1 461 bp in size, with 72 bp 5'-UTR, 183 bp 3'-UTR and 1206 bp ORF, encoding a protein of 401 amino acids with a molecular weight of 44.32 kD and pI 7.21. The sequence analysis indicated that the deduced amino acid sequence of BHMT shared high identity (77%-93%) with nine other species; the highest was 93% with Perca flavescens. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to characterize the expression of BHMT in ten tissues including muscle, heart, eye, brain, gill, liver, intestine, kidney, adipose tissue and spleen. The results showed that BHMT is only expressed in the liver, intestines and kidney. BHMT mRNA in these three tissues declined after the fish were transferred from sea water to a higher salinity environment and induced when transferred to a lower salinity environment. BHMT gene in liver, intestine and kidney can also be induced after intraperitoneal injection of betaine. Our results show that betaine can induce the transcription of BHMT in fish, and BHMT play pivotal roles in adaptation to osmotic change."
0,"We previously characterized the β-actin gene promoter of Indian domesticated rohu carp (Labeo rohita) and made a reporter construct via fusion to green fluorescence protein (GFP) cDNA. In this study, the same construct was used to breed transgenic rohu fish. About 20% of the transgenic offspring showed ubiquitous expression of the reporter GFP gene. In a few of the transgenic fish, we documented massive epithelial and/or muscular expression with visible green color under normal light. The expression of GFP mRNA was higher in the muscle tissue of transgenic fish than in that of non-transgenic fish. A highly efficient nucleofection protocol was optimized to transfect proliferating spermatogonial cells of rohu using this reporter construct. The β-actin promoter also drove expressions in HEK293 (derived from human embryonic kidney cells), K562 (human leukemic cells) and SF21 (insect ovarian cells) lines. These findings imply conserved regulatory mechanisms of β-actin gene expression across eukaryotes. Furthermore, the isolated β-actin promoter with consensus regulatory elements has the potential to be used in generating transgenic carp with genes of interest and in basic biology research. "
0,"The exceptional hypoxia tolerance of the goldfish heart may be achieved through the activation of an alternative mechanism recruiting the first product of the anaerobic glycolysis (i.e. piruvate). This hypothesis led to design a classical mass spectrometry based proteomic study to identify in the goldfish cardiac proteins that may be associated with maintaining heart function under normoxia and hypoxia. A selective protein solubilization, SDS PAGE, trypsin digestion and MALDI MS/MS analysis allowed the identification of the 12 most stable hypoxia-regulated proteins. Among these proteins, five are enzymes catalyzing reversible steps of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis network. Protein composition reveals the presence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase B as a specific hypoxia-regulated protein. This work indicated that the key enzyme of reversible steps of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis network is fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, aldolase B, suggesting a role of gluconeogenesis in the mechanisms involved in the goldfish heart response to hypoxia."
0,"Tissue factor pathway inhibitors (TFPI), including TFPI-1 and TFPI-2, are Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors that mainly inhibit the blood coagulation induced by tissue factors. Previous reports on teleost proved TFPI play important roles in innate immunity. In this study, two TFPI (PoTFPI-1 and PoTFPI-2) molecules from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) were analyzed and characterized for their expression patterns, antibacterial and anticancer activities of the C-terminal derived peptides. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis shows that constitutive PoTFPI-1 expression occurred, in increasing order, in the brain, muscle, spleen, gills, head kidney, blood, intestine, heart, and liver; PoTFPI-2 was expressed, in increasing order, in the brain, gills, head kidney, muscle, intestine, spleen, liver, heart, and blood. Under the stimulation of fish pathogens, both PoTFPI-1 and PoTFPI-2 expressions increased significantly in a manner that depended on the pathogens, tissue type, and infection stage. Furthermore, C-terminal peptides TP25 and TP26, derived from PoTFPI-1 and PoTFPI-2, respectively, were synthesized and proved to be active against Micrococcus luteus (for TP25 and TP26) and Staphylococcus aureus (for TP25) via retardation effects on bacterial nucleic acids. In addition, TP25 and TP26 also displayed significant inhibitory effects on human colon cancer cell line HT-29. These results reveal that both PoTFPI-1 and PoTFPI-2 play important roles in host innate immunity. The antibacterial activity and anticancer cells function of TP25 and TP26 will add new insights into the roles of teleost TFPI."
0,"In most groups of electric fish, the current-producing cells of electric organs (EOs) derive from striated muscle fibers but retain some phenotypic characteristics of their precursor muscle cells. Given the role of the MyoD family of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) in the transcriptional activation of the muscle program in vertebrates, we examined their expression in the electrocytes of the gymnotiform Sternopygus macrurus. We estimated the number of MRF genes in the S. macrurus genome and our Southern blot analyses revealed a single MyoD, myogenin, myf5 and MRF4 gene. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that muscle and EO transcribe all MRF genes. With the exception of MyoD, the endogenous levels of myogenin, myf5 and MRF4 transcripts in electrocytes were greater than those detected in muscle fibers. These data indicate that MRF expression levels are not sufficient to predict the level to which the muscle program is manifested. Qualitative expression analysis of MRF co-regulators MEF2C, Id1 and Id2 also revealed these genes not to be unique to either muscle or EO, and detected similar expression patterns in the two tissues. Therefore, the partial muscle program of the EO is not associated with a partial expression of MRFs or with apparent distinct levels of some MRF co-factors. In addition, electrical inactivation by spinal cord transection (ST) resulted in the up-regulation of some muscle proteins in electrocytes without an accompanying increase in MRF transcript levels or notable changes in the co-factors MEF2C, Id1 and Id2. These findings suggest that the neural regulation of the skeletal muscle program via MRFs in S. macrurus might differ from that of their mammalian counterparts. Together, these data further our understanding of the molecular processes involved in the plasticity of the vertebrate skeletal muscle program that brings about the muscle-like phenotype of the non-contractile electrogenic cells in S. macrurus."
0,"Biological rhythms are driven by circadian oscillators, which are ultimately controlled by the cyclic expression of clock genes. Cryptochromes (CRY), blue light photoreceptors, belong to the negative elements of the transcriptional feedback loop into the molecular clock. This paper describes the cloning and characterization of two cryptochromes (cry1 and 2) in European seabass, which is considered an interesting chronobiology model due to its dual (diurnal/nocturnal) behavior. The cloned cDNA fragments encoded for two proteins of 567 and 668 amino acids, which included the FAD-binding and the DNA-photolyase domains. Moreover, both proteins had a high homology with cryptochrome proteins (Cry) of other teleost fish. These cry1 and 2 genes were expressed in several tissues of seabass (brain, liver, heart, retina, muscle, spleen, gill and intestine). In addition, the daily expression of cry1 was rhythmic in brain, heart and liver with the acrophase around ZT 03:15 h (after the onset of lights). Similarly, the cry2 daily expression was rhythmic in liver, peaking at ZT 03:28 h, whereas in brain the acrophase was at ZT 11:08 h (shortly prior to the offset of lights). These findings provide new elements to help understanding the functioning of the molecular clock of seabass."
0,"Effect of hypoosmotic conditions of medium on oxygen regime of skeletal muscles of the stenohalin goby Gobius cobitus Pallas was studied under conditions of experiment. The control fish group was maintained at 12-14 %o, the experimental one - at 4.8-5.6 per thousand. Duration of the experiment - 44-45 days, water temperature - 15 +/- 1 degrees C, photoperiod - 12 day/12 night. It was established that under conditions of external hypoosmia there occurred hydration of the goby skeletal muscles and a decrease of their diffusion capability with respect to oxygen. The latter was accompanied by the tissue P(O2) decrease, which is indicated by low values of P(O2) in the venous blood outflowing from muscles. For the first 14-16 days of adaptation to the hypoosmotic medium there were restricted processes of mass transfer and oxygen utilization, which was associated with a decrease of the voluminous tissue blood flow and the blood oxygen concentration. These changes occurred on the background of the blood plasma hydration and a decrease of the number of circulated erythrocytes, and then they were completely compensated."
0,"It is generally thought that the rapid relaxation of fast muscles is facilitated by the Ca(2+) binding protein parvalbumin (Parv). Indeed superfast swimbladder (SWB) muscle of toadfish contains the largest concentration of this protein ever observed (up to 1.5 mM). At 15 degrees C toadfish perform a 100 Hz call, 400 ms in duration, followed by a long (5-15 s) intercall interval. It has been proposed that Parv helps sequester the Ca(2+) during the call, and then Ca(2+) unbinds and is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during the long intercall interval. Midshipman (Porichthys notatus) is another fish which calls at a high frequency; 80-100 Hz at a temperature of 12-15 degrees C. However, unlike toadfish, midshipman call with a 100% duty cycle. Without an intercall interval, Parv would seem of little use as it would become saturated early in calling. Here we show that the midshipman SWB has only about 1/8th of the Parv in toadfish. Moreover, total Parv content in calling male midshipman SWB was not different from that in the non-calling female and the much slower locomotory muscles. These data suggest that Parv does not play a large role in the calling of midshipman, which is accomplished without a high concentration of this protein. Native gel-electrophoresis also revealed presence of three major (PA-I, PA-II and PA-III) and two minor (PA-Ia and PA-IIIa, <5% of total content) Parv isoforms in adult toadfish SWB. Midshipman SWB contained about equal amounts of PA-I and PA-II and also a small (approximately 10%) amount of PA-III. By amino acid composition, toadfish PA-Ia and PA-I isoforms were different from PA-II and PA-III isoforms (by 24 and 14 residues, respectively)."
0,"Many fish species experience long periods of fasting often associated with seasonal reductions in water temperature and prey availability or spawning migrations. During periods of nutrient restriction, changes in metabolism occur to provide cellular energy via catabolic processes. Muscle is particularly affected by prolonged fasting as proteins of this tissue act as a major energy source. However, the molecular components involved in muscle protein degradation as well as the regulatory networks that control their function are still incompletely defined in fish. The present work aimed to characterize the response of the autophagy-lysosomal degradative pathway to nutrient and serum availability in primary culture of rainbow trout myoblasts. In this aim, 4-day-old cells were incubated in a serum and amino acid-rich medium (complete medium), a serum and amino acid-deprived medium (minimal medium) or a minimal medium plus amino acids, and both the transcription-independent short-term response and the transcription-dependent long-term response of the autophagy-lysosomal degradative pathway were analyzed. We report that serum and amino acids withdrawal is accompanied by a rapid increase of autophagosome formation but also by a slower induction of the expression of several autophagy-related genes (LC3B, gabarapl1, atg4b). We also showed that this latter response is controlled by amino acid (AA) availability and that both TOR-dependent and TOR-independent pathways are involved in this effect. Together these results suggest an important role for AA released by muscle proteolysis during the fasting period in regulating the subtle balance between using proteins as disposable furniture to provide energy, and conserving muscle through protein sparing."
0,"Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) emerged evolutionarily in association with the chordate-vertebrate lineage. Our studies overall explore the evolution of CaSRs, and the possible historical linkage of CaSRs to vertebrate skeleton as functional components of calcium homeostasis through regulated storage and/or release. We applied both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate Casr gene and CaSR protein expression, respectively, in skeletal tissues of a cichlid teleost, the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). By RT-PCR, CaSR gene (Casr) expression was observed in skull and vertebral column (including notochordal tissues). Relative to skeleton, IHC revealed CaSR protein expression in notochordal sheath cells within the vertebral canal, in scleroblasts associated with body surface scales, and in chondrocytes within hyaline cartilage. Although closely apposed cells border the acellular bone in tilapia, these cells were only weakly immunostained. We conclude, therefore, that CaSR is expressed in skeletal tissues of tilapia, an advanced teleost fish, and that Casr may be part of a genetic network associated with vertebrate skeletal system. Our immunohistochemical examination also newly revealed CaSR protein expression in epidermis and red muscle of fishes."
0,"Anthropogenic release of uranium (U), originating from the nuclear fuel cycle or military activities, may considerably increase U concentrations in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems above the naturally occurring background levels found throughout the environment. With a projected increase in the world-wide use of nuclear power, it is important to improve our understanding of the possible effects of this metal on the aquatic fauna at concentrations commensurate with the provisional drinking water guideline value of the World Health Organization (15 μg U/L). The present study has examined the mitochondrial function in brain and skeletal muscles of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, exposed to 30 and 100 μg/L of waterborne U for 10 and 28 days. At the lower concentration, the basal mitochondrial respiration rate was increased in brain at day 10 and in muscles at day 28. This is due to an increase of the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability, resulting in a decrease of the respiratory control ratio. In addition, levels of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX-IV) increased in brain at day 10, and those of COX-I increased in muscles at day 28. Histological analyses performed by transmission electron microscopy revealed an alteration of myofibrils and a dilatation of endomysium in muscle cells. These effects were largest at the lowest concentration, following 28 days of exposure."
0,"Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides, a carnivorous fish native to North America) prefers to utilize amino acids as energy sources rather than glucose and fatty acids. However, little is known about the nutritional regulation of substrate oxidation in the fish. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine whether the oxidation of glutamate, glutamine, glucose and palmitate in its tissues might be influenced by dietary protein intake. Juvenile largemouth bass (initial weight 18.3 ± 0.1 g) were fed three isocaloric diets containing 40%, 45% and 50% protein for 8 weeks. The growth performance, energy retention, and lipid retention of juvenile fish increased with increasing dietary protein levels. The rate of oxidation of glutamate by the intestine was much greater than that of glutamine, explaining why increasing the dietary protein content from 40% to 50% had no effect on the serum concentration of glutamate but increased that of glutamine in the fish. The liver of fish fed the 50% protein diet had a higher (P < 0.05) rate of glutamine oxidation than that in the 40% and 45% protein groups. In contrast, augmenting dietary protein content from 40% to 45% increased (P < 0.05) both glutamine and glutamate oxidation in the proximal intestine of the fish and renal glutamine oxidation, without changes in intestinal or renal AA oxidation between the 45% and 50% protein groups. Furthermore, the rates of glucose oxidation in the liver, kidney, and intestine of largemouth bass were decreased in response to an  increase in dietary  protein content   from 40% to 45% and a concomitant decrease in dietary starch content from 22.3% to 15.78%, but did not differ between the 45% and 50% protein groups.   The rates of oxidation of glucose in skeletal muscle and those of palmitate in all tissues (except for the  kidney) were not affected by the diets. Collectively, these results indicate that the largemouth bass can regulate substrate metabolism in a  tissue-specific manner to favor protein and lipid gains as dietary protein content increases from 40% to 50% and have a lower ability to oxidize fatty acids and glucose than amino acids regardless of the dietary protein intake."
0,"In the present study, members of the interleukin (IL)-10 family of cytokines, including IL-10 (TOIL-10) and IL-22 (TOIL-22) of golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus), were cloned for the first time, and their expression patterns and 3D structures analyzed. The full-length cDNA sequences of TOIL-10 and TOIL-22 contained open reading frames of 564 and 567 bp, respectively. TOIL-10 and TOIL-22 shared higher homology (78%-89%) with the corresponding genes from various fish relative to other species (25%-34%) and contained the IL-10 family signature and four cysteine residues that are well conserved in other vertebrate IL-10 members. Phylogenetic tree analysis of our sequences alongside other IL-10 family proteins revealed that TOIL-10 and TOIL-22 cluster together with other teleost IL-10 and IL-22 molecules. Expression of TOIL-10 and TOIL-22 genes was ubiquitous in all tissues examined. The TOIL-10 gene was also highly expressed in skin, heart, gill, spleen, kidney, brain and liver, and lower levels were detected in intestine and muscle. High expression of the TOIL-22 gene was observed in gill, intestine, kidney, spleen, with the lowest levels in liver. TOIL-10 and TOIL-22 were rapidly activated after SAΔphoB immunization and significantly increased to peak levels at 12 h and 4 d in golden pompano kidney and spleen respectively following challenge. Expression in the brain reached peak levels at 4 d and 3 d respectively after post-immunization. Our results collectively indicate that TOIL-10 and TOIL-22 participate in the host immune response to bacterial infection. Moreover, TOIL-22 plays a potentially important role in mucosal immunity."
0,"Fish commercial transport is an ordinary practice in the aquaculture industry. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a 48 h transport stress on stress response of meagre (<i>Argyrosomus regius</i>) juveniles. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) and Real-Time PCR were used to evaluate muscle cortisol levels and to assess glucocorticoid receptor (<i>gr</i>) gene expression in fish muscle and liver, respectively. Presence and localization of various oxidative stress markers were investigated in different tissues by immunohistochemistry. A significant increase in muscle cortisol levels was observed after loading but a significant decrease occurred after 16 h from departure even without returning to control levels. Molecular analysis on stress response revealed an increase in muscle <i>gr</i> expression after fish loading that started decreasing during the travel returning to the control level at the end of the transport. Instead, no differences in liver <i>gr</i> expression were observed along the different sampling points. Immunostaining for heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), nitrotyrosine (NT) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) antibodies was detected in several organs. Notably, a higher NT immunostaining intensity was evident in skin and gills of the transported animals with respect to controls. Results demonstrated that cortisol and <i>gr</i> are useful indicators of stressful conditions in transported fish."
0,"In mammals, glucose transporter (GLUT)-4 plays an important role in glucose homeostasis mediating insulin action to increase glucose uptake in insulin-responsive tissues. In the basal state, GLUT4 is located in intracellular compartments and upon insulin stimulation is recruited to the plasma membrane, allowing glucose entry into the cell. Compared with mammals, fish are less efficient restoring plasma glucose after dietary or exogenous glucose administration. Recently our group cloned a GLUT4-homolog in skeletal muscle from brown trout (btGLUT4) that differs in protein motifs believed to be important for endocytosis and sorting of mammalian GLUT4. To study the traffic of btGLUT4, we generated a stable L6 muscle cell line overexpressing myc-tagged btGLUT4 (btGLUT4myc). Insulin stimulated btGLUT4myc recruitment to the cell surface, although to a lesser extent than rat-GLUT4myc, and enhanced glucose uptake. Interestingly, btGLUT4myc showed a higher steady-state level at the cell surface under basal conditions than rat-GLUT4myc due to a higher rate of recycling of btGLUT4myc and not to a slower endocytic rate, compared with rat-GLUT4myc. Furthermore, unlike rat-GLUT4myc, btGLUT4myc had a diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm of L6 myoblasts. In primary brown trout skeletal muscle cells, insulin also promoted the translocation of endogenous btGLUT4 to the plasma membrane and enhanced glucose transport. Moreover, btGLUT4 exhibited a diffuse intracellular localization in unstimulated trout myocytes. Our data suggest that btGLUT4 is subjected to a different intracellular traffic from rat-GLUT4 and may explain the relative glucose intolerance observed in fish."
0,"The lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are the largest and highest lake group in the world. Gymnocypris selincuoensis is the only cyprinid fish living in lake Selincuo, the largest lake on QTP. However, its genetic resource is still blank, limiting studies on molecular and genetic analysis. In this study, the transcriptome of G. selincuoensis was first generated by using PacBio Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-seq. A full-length (FL) transcriptome with 75,435 transcripts was obtained by Iso-Seq with N50 length of 3,870 bp. Among all transcripts, 75,016 were annotated to public databases, 64,710 contain complete open reading frames and 2,811 were long non-coding RNAs. Based on all- vs.-all BLAST, 2,069 alternative splicing events were detected, and 80% of them were validated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Tissue gene expression atlas showed that the number of detected expressed transcripts ranged from 37,397 in brain to 19,914 in muscle, with 10,488 transcripts detected in all seven tissues. Comparative genomic analysis with other cyprinid fishes identified 77 orthologous genes with potential positive selection (Ka/Ks > 0.3). A total of 56,696 perfect simple sequence repeats were identified from FL transcripts. Our results provide valuable genetic resources for further studies on adaptive evolution, gene expression and population genetics in G. selincuoensis and other congeneric fishes."
0,"Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are a group of molecular chaperones and play a crucial role in cell response to various stresses. In this study, we cloned and sequenced a small heat shock protein 27 (LcHSP27) cDNA from large yellow croaker, Larimichthys crocea. The full-length cDNA of LcHSP27 was 1227 bp, including a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 54 bp, a 3'-terminal UTR of 561 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 612 bp encoding a polypeptide of 203 amino acids. Three conserved phosphorylation sites of serine were identified in the deduced LcHSP27 amino acid sequence at positions 15, 91 and 95 respectively, and a typical α-crystallin domain was at positions 96-193. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that LcHSP27 was categorized together with the HSP27 obtained from other fish. And a closer phylogenetic relationship of HSP27 was found with HSP22, then HSP30. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated the strongest expression of LcHSP27 in heart. However, expression of LcHSP27 in other examined tissues including muscle, brain, liver, spleen, kidney, gill, and blood was very weak. The impact of temperature and cadmium (Cd(2+)) stress on LcHSP27 expression was tested in liver and brain. The results showed that the levels of LcHSP27 expression increased significantly after low temperature (19°C) and high temperature (27°C and 31°C) stress both in liver and brain. And low temperature stress induced a higher LcHSP27 expression in liver. More important, LcHSP27 expression showed a dramatic up-regulation after a combined stress of temperature and cadmium (p<0.05). These results reveal that HSP27 may play an important role in the large yellow croaker response to temperature and cadmium stress."
0,"The mucosal surfaces of fish (skin, gill and intestine) constitute the primary line of defense against pathogen invasion. Although the importance of fish mucosal surfaces as the first barriers against pathogens cannot be overstated, the knowledge of teleost mucosal immunity are still limited. Cathepsin B, a lysosomal cysteine protease, is involved in multiple levels of physiological and biological processes, and playing crucial roles for host immune defense against pathogen infection. In this regard, we identified the cathepsin B (ctsba) of channel catfish and investigated the expression patterns of the ctsba in mucosal tissues following Edwardsiella ictaluri and Flavobacterium columnare challenge. Here, catfish ctsba gene was widely expressed in all examined tissues with the lowest expression level in muscle, and the highest expression level in trunk kidney, followed by spleen, gill, head kidney, intestine, liver and skin. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis showed the catfish ctsba had the strongest relationship to zebrafish. Moreover, the ctsba showed a general trend of up-regulated in mucosal tissues following both Gram-negative bacterial challenge. Taken together, the increased expression of ctsba in mucosal surfaces indicated the protective function of ctsba against bacterial infection, and the requirement for effective clearance of invading bacteria. Further studies are needed, indeed, to expand functional characterization and examine whether ctsba may play additional physiological and biological roles in catfish mucosal tissues. "
